<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My past political activity has largely centered on getting out the vote in underrepresented communities, supporting local campaigns, and advocating for policy measures impacting the underrepresented communities. I have supported efforts in immigrant and Muslim communities that aimed to register community members to vote and informed them of ballot measures. Specifcally, in 2018, I spearheaded the National Muslim Voter Registration - Colorado effort, where we held voter registration drives outside of 9 mosques throughout Colorado following Friday congregational prayers. We had nearly 100 people register to vote that day - many of them for the first time. That effort recruited volunteers from all faith backgrounds and included a partnership with the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition and the DRIVE Project. This past year, I did donate to Iman Jodeh&#39;s Colorado State Legislature HD41 campaign. Partisanly, I have also attended local and state Democratic events, though I did not make donations during those events. All other donations have been to nonpartisan organizations focused on general voter registration in underrepresented communities. It is common to see strong voter apathy in Muslim and immigrant communities. To address this barrier, I collaborated with local nonprofits to engage political candidates in conversation about community concerns, needs, and the value of voting. This included meet-and-greets, discussion with community leadership, and meeting with local politicians about specific policy and community matters.

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My education, professional experiences, and civic engagement speak to my passion for organizing humanitarian services and advocating for the rights and civil liberties of community groups throughout Colorado. My public health and public policy background prepared me with the knowledge and frameworks needed to analyze and address social issues in ways that leverage community assets and support, rather than lead, communities in actualizing their goals. At my age, my civic engagement has empowered me with the tools and skill sets  to secure professional experiences in positions with the Denver Police Department and U.S. Census Bureau, to name a few. In both of these positions, I have leveraged my community rapport to secure community partnerships to address the rise of domestic violent extremism and achieve a complete and accurate count for the 2020 Census, respectively. In these positions, I have led community discussions to address community concerns, needs, and assets and worked with government partners in resolving them to achieve goals and build community trust. In fact, I was managing 70+ community partnerships for the Denver Police Department and more than 200 community partnerships for the 2020 Census. In my civic engagement endeavors, I continue to be deeply involved in matters pertaining to the Muslim, refugee, immigrant, and homeless communities, to name a few. These endeavors have included empowering communities with civil rights knowledge, elevating community concerns so that they may be addressed by key stakeholders, primarily government partners, and organizing citywide events featuring services and resources provided by dozens of community partners with the support of nearly 100 volunteers to provide essentials to the homeless community. Consequently, I have been awarded community recognitions and appointed to positions, like the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment State Board of Health and the Denver Immigrant and Refugee Commission, given my civic engagement endeavors.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Fair and accurate redistricting is vital to ensuring the democracy we pride ourselves for having as Americans. It would be an honor to be a part of this commission, privileging me with the ability to leverage my 2020 Census experience, community connections, and knowledge. In fact, for the last year, I served as a partnership specialist for the U.S. Census Bureau. My purpose was to build partnerships with trusted community voices for a complete and accurate count for the 2020 Census with a special focus on immigrant, refugee, and faith communities. A key point for a complete and accurate count was that it leads to fair political representation and accurate redistricting data. Serving on the commission would be an actualization of the key point I leveraged to motivate communities to strive for a complete and accurate count for the 2020 Census. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I strongly believe empathetic and active listening while keeping an &#39;eye on the prize&#39; are essential to promoting consensus as they create an environment where everywhere feels that their perspectives are heard and understood, while keeping everyone focused on the overarching goal. A few years ago, I co-founded the Colorado Muslim Leadership Council, which serves as an umbrella for Muslim-led and serving organizations in Colorado. This includes organizations that are activist, social services, and/or religiously based. The Muslim community is extremely diverse with more than 20 nationalities represented and a geographic presence that spans the entire state of Colorado. A key aspect of launching this umbrella organization was having an honest conversation with the member organizations in the beginning about community norms for the entity and what accountability looked like for those norms. Every community is different and therefore it is key to establish community norms that meet the needs and aspirations of the community in mind and are living in nature as things do change. As a co-founder and the council&#39;s facilitator, I facilitated the community norms conversations and continued to handle member concerns, ensure robert&#39;s rules of orders are upheld during meetings, and ensure that all organizations, regardless of size and assets, felt they were heard and treated fairly. Naturally, as the facilitator, I was not affiliated with any of the member organizations and set a clear, fair framework on how concerns can be shared and addressed. 

One serious matter that came before the council was the Pulse Nightclub Shooting. The assiliant identified as a Muslim and dozens of innocent people lost their lives simply because of their sexual orientation. As the facilitator of the council, I had to tred carefully around how the council would respond because while the shooting was a tragedy, there is a division in the Muslim community about LGBTQ+ advocacy from a Muslim perspective, as is the same with any religious affiliation. It was imperative to allow each member organization an opportunity to verbally share what they believed the appropriate response was, while respecting their respective religious values. Upon gathering all those statements, I identified a pattern and proposed to the group the following: issue a press conference with an invitation to all member organizations that provided condolences and prayers to the families affected, reminded the media of the Islamic values around human dignity and preserving all human life, and supported the LGBTQ+ identities in having safe lives in which they are not punished, but protected. This press conference garnered positive community response and I was invited, as a faith leader, to participate in an interfaith prayer at the beginning of the Pride Parade that following weekend. 

I believe this experience, among others, equips me with the skills and knowledge needed to promote consensus among commissioners. Additionally, I do have experience serving as a commissioner for the Denver Immigrant and Refugee Commission and representing Congressional District 4 rural public health interests on the State Board of Health.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My educational background, personal experiences, and professional roles have allowed me to gain and continuously improve my creative analytic, critical thinking, communication, and research skills. I have been the team lead for community projects, like the Denver Day of Dignity in which I was the city coordinator for the last five years, where I recruited and collaborated with an executive team of 5 other individuals to recruit 100 volunteers, serve 700 community members experiencing homelessness, and engage more than 30 partners for a one-day event. I have supported research endeavors that have explored the etiology of multiple sclerosis, analyzed the fairness of policing policies for nations around the globe, and investigated genetic markers for prostate cancer. In these positions, I was handling my own research projects, requiring the collection, interpretation, and presentation of data. I have handled a few hundred community partnerships for the 2020 Census, where I regularly communicated updates, suggested new outreach ideas, built cross-organization collaborations, and monitored outreach progress. A common trend for all these examples is that in each case I had to be clear about my overarching goal, to understand my available resources and the ones I would need to secure, and to establish a means of progress evaluation to ensure I was on track to achieving the goal in the best way possible.
