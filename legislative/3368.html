        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Joseph William Bender</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>

  Joseph William Bender
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>J William Bender, Will Bender</span></p>

<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>

</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Bachelors of Agricultural Engineering, Licensed EIT in state of CO
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80236
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Previously when I lived in Charlotte NC I had volunteered for a Democratic state Senator&#39;s (Jeff Jackson) reelection campaign. Would have been prior to moving to CO in October 2015. I have not contributed to any political campaigns or PACs before.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I&#39;m a member of an elected committee responsible for nominating new lay leadership candidates at my church, First Universalist of Denver.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I do not have much direct experience with groups within Colorado as I had kids born shortly after moving here so much of my non-working time has been dedicated the last few years to raising my young twins. However, I do greatly value the impact civic organizations can have on a community. I was a boy scout and earned my eagle scout rank by facilitating and leading a major grounds improvement project for my community when I was only 16. I think giving back to a community is an important part in being a responsible citizen in America.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have long believed that independent redistricting is one of the single most important ways to promote democracy. No politician or political group should have a say in who will vote for them. Growing up in NC I saw some of the worst and egregious cases of political gerrymandering anywhere in the country. This was especially utilized to isolate large demographic blocks like African-Americans and immigrant communities to under-represent their interests in government. This action is both unethical and, in my opinion, counter to the core values of America.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My background within the project management space has given me lots of experience on how to manage both interactions with broad groups of stakeholders. I&#39;ve had to explain major issues both to clients and also to employees. This has trained me to handle people&#39;s expectations and also how to have challenging conversations in an open and honest method. Making sure that multiple people come together in a mutually beneficial way is a major part of meeting project goals successfully.
I also feel that my experience in project management has made me be fair or impartial. Many times it was part of my job to implement decisions or processes that I may not have agreed with. But recognizing that everyone has to contribute in a meaningful manner and that individual preferences cannot be the sole driving factor in decisions.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My background in telecommunications means I have experience specifically in optimizing maps. Large portions of my work experience has dealt with creating compact, concise, and efficient maps and also having the technical skill to explain my teams design decisions to non-technical stakeholders. I have an engineering background so have an analytical mindset about breaking problems into smaller components and then tackling each individual component. My current field is in automation of problem solving so it has given me more appreciation for iteration and review processes to make sure designs are accurate and precise.
