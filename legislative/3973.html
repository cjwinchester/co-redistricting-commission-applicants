<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have a diverse background in communications and I use my skills in diverse ways. Listening to, learning about and sharing the stories of the people I have met is central to my advocacy work. At OtterCares, I met with and listened to the stories of area non-profits in order to build relationships and to better understand how the Foundation could effectively meet their needs. Serving on the grant-making and fund distribution team activated my desire to learn about the causes of inequity. At Unite for Literacy, I learned about the role the number books in a child’s home plays in social and economic equity. I then developed campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of childhood literacy and hosted events to inform families about free, multilingual, non-fiction picture books for children. Creating and organizing pop-up reading events, meeting with school districts, partnering with non-profits and securing sponsorships helped provide numerous indigenous and underserved children with relatable books, for free. Listening to and learning more about the needs of diverse children led me to a small high school in rural Colorado where the student population speaks 27 different languages and the majority of community is minority. Understanding the importance of early education and being aware of the effects of the rural and urban divide, I began supporting an Ethnic Studies Professor at CSU to help develop a peer-mentoring program so first-generation college students could mentor the immigrant and refugee high school students in this rural town. I showcased the students’ stories and their work by producing a Virtual Reality documentary film called Who I Am. The film was featured at the Breckenridge Film Festival and The A.C.T. Human Rights Film Festival in Fort Collins. I also gave a TED Talk about the program and the life-changing impacts it had on the students. This approach helped secure funding from statewide organizations and foundations and helped ensure the sustainability of the program. Several mentees have continued their education and are now mentors at the collegiate level. Many of our original mentors have graduated college and are either employed in the field of their degree or pursuing their master’s degree. The mentoring program is now managed by CSU and is underway in 20 different schools across northern Colorado. My experience with these young students and the timing of the 2016 Presidential Election cemented my advocacy work in the immigrant community and led me to the Community Dreamer Fund. The Dreamer Fund board consists of undocumented CSU students, faith leaders and community members and we provide emergency funding to DACA, undocumented and asylum-seeking high school and college students in Larimer County. We raise awareness and money by hosting educational and outreach events and we provide a safe environment for students to share their stories. These efforts have helped students establish connections and build relationships in the community and has also helped secure financial support from key organizations in Larimer County. In 2018, I traveled to the Arizona/Mexico border for a weeks-long immigration immersion class. I have added that life-changing experience to my advocacy work to help inform others about the importance of immigration reform. In 2020 I became a board member of ISAAC and our vision to support local immigrants and change local and state immigration policy is currently underway.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am a four generation Coloradan and I have seen this state change in many ways. I grew up in a rural town and I know, through my own personal and professional experiences, that the divide between rural and urban communities is very real. As our state continues to grow and becomes more diverse, and my work with the immigrant community continues to expand, I want to serve on this commission to ensure that everyone and in our state is represented equitably.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Over the past six years I have, as Bryan Stevenson describes, put myself in proximity of issues that I know very little about. Six years ago, I knew very little about immigration, but I put myself in proximity of the issue in order to learn. I engaged with young people, I asked questions, built relationships with families and immigrant leaders and I learned from my mistakes. And I am now a trusted community member and ally and I have data that reflects my progress. The relationships I have built and the information I have gathered allows me to confidently, factually and passionately share stories about immigration issues with the broader community in order to create equity. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My Liberal Arts degree trained me to listen, observe and ask questions in order to learn and find truth. My empathetic nature helps me communicate factually and respectfully. Many of the undocumented and DACAmented students I work with right now are full of fear, for themselves and their families. We work together to address their fear and then we develop plans that help them stay focused on their schoolwork and their goals. I utilize my relationships with experts and partners to help provide facts that support the students’ plans and we able to keep working and make progress.
