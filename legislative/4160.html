<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a litigator, my work is representing clients.  As a solo practitioner I have the freedom to choose clients in significant measure because I want to represent them to assure that they received justice.  My work now mainly focuses on appeals, with considerable attention to constitutional issues, criminal defense, and the rights of parents and children in termination of parental rights matters.  That work is largely a matter of making sure that ordinary people are not merely heard but well represented in the highest courts of Colorado and at the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.
In terms of organizations, I have focused my activities on the legal profession.  After spending the first decade of my career &quot;putting in my time&quot; and establishing my credentials, I have become increasingly active in access to justice issues (for example, partly in response to problems encountered by my clients, I recently led a process that started drafting new rules on the rights of parents, especially indigent parents, in termination of parental rights proceedings) and issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion within the legal profession (including, most recently, spearheading an ongoing restructuring of the internal practices of the Appellate Practice Subcommittee of the Colorado Bar Association).

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Fairness for all in fundamental questions of the structure of the electoral system is a natural extension of my interests in access to justice and equity and inclusion.  Each vote should count equally.  And nonpartisan redistricting, it seems to me, is an essential first step in that direction.  
More personally, I am an adult immigrant to the US who grew up in a system of highly managed elections and unequal justice based on one&#39;s political and religious views.  Partisan gerrymandering of the sort practiced with increasingly exclusionary results in some jurisdictions is too close for comfort to what I left behind.  Participating in a nonpartisan redistricting process would be a way to strengthen the kind of electoral system that I believe every American, and every human being, deserves.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The requirements for drawing districts greatly restrict the range of acceptable maps.  A commitment to impartiality should help to identify possible outcomes that fall within the range of alternatives that should be acceptable to all participants of good faith.  And a commitment to the process of nonpartisan redistricting can help to keep things on track.  I would seek to facilitate agreement through the rigorous critical evaluation of all proposals in the context of a group of people of good will trying to find a way in which each person can leave the room believing that their preferred proposals were not merely heard but rigorously evaluated – and that the final result was something that a diverse group of reasonable people of good will, operating within the guidelines of the process, could reasonably agree to.  And I think that my focus on impartiality above all else could help to push the process towards an end acceptable to all.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Being an effective litigator requires an ability to see all sides without sacrificing the distinctive needs and perspectives of one&#39;s client; being able to turn one&#39;s critical skills on one&#39;s own arguments in order to strengthen them.  Especially in appellate work, what matters most is the reach of your analytical vision and the clarity and precision of your arguments.  These same basic skills, including an ability to work through the full range of intended and unintended consequences of a decision, would, I believe, contribute greatly to the work of the Commission.
