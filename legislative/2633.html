<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I have been Professor of Biology at Colorado State University Pueblo (CSU Pueblo) for over 25 years and was recently chair of Biology department for three years. Before moving to Colorado I was Director of a research center in Mali. My managerial background also includes being Director of the Master in Biology program at CSU Pueblo for seven years. The outside collaboration with research scientists at other institutions in US helped me approach teaching and critical thinking from a broader perspective. I chaired and/or served on several committees at CSU Pueblo, including faculty senate committees and the University Board on Diversity and Equality. I conducted several community outreach research projects, working with stakeholders and thus gaining experience about how to effectively seek and capitalize on community input. Serving professional organizations at the local, regional, national and international levels also improved my personal skills in working with people from different backgrounds and reaching agreement. 

Among others, I received the CSU Pueblo’s Award for Outstanding Scholarship, the CSU Pueblo’s Award for Outstanding Service, the CSU Pueblo’s College of STEM Outstanding faculty member Award, and was inducted into Who’s Who Among America’s Teachers for Excellence in Teaching. I have published extensively and have been technical reviewer for several agencies and international journals. I conducted consultancies to several international agencies. A recent community outreach research project in my lab, which involved participation of stakeholders, was instrumental in putting Pueblo, Colorado on the EPA Superfund National Priority List due to high concentrations of hazardous heavy metals in topsoil in areas of the city, leading to current cleanup in these parts of Pueblo to protect public health. I am a Certified Mediator and I served as University Grievance Officer at CSU Pueblo for five years; this experience will benefit the commission when it comes to consensus decision making.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
No partisanship contributions to political campaigns or organization since November 10, 2015.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). I am member of Pueblo NAACP. The mission of NAACP is “… to secure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of rights in order to eliminate race-based discrimination and ensure the health and well-being of all persons.” Pueblo African American Concern Organization (PAACO): I was President of PAACO for three years. Our mission was to raise scholarships for needy Pueblo, Colorado college students, regardless of ethnic backgrounds or other considerations.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As proud Coloradan, I feel a strong sense of responsibility to uphold democracy in this state. Unfair district maps are a threat to democracy, because they could cause people to lose confidence in their votes, and/or not vote at all. The upcoming redistricting process based on the 2020 Census should ensure that a politician knows and engages his/her constituents and cannot just rely on his/her base to secure (re-)election. Constituents with common interest should be able to have common representation. I teach at Colorado State University Pueblo, live in Colorado Springs, and have friends all over the state. I would like to see Colorado be a national leader in development of fair and equitable apportioning congressional districts, leading to elections that reflect the will of the people, and thus strengthening trust in our democratic system.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Voters will not trust the redistricting commission’s work unless there is fairness and impartiality, regardless of the personal differences and various perspectives of the commissioners. As a Certified Mediator who was University Grievance Officer for five years, I understand the importance of practical compromise in consensus decision making. As Research Center Director, Chair of the Biology Department at Colorado State University Pueblo (largest department on campus), and chair of various University committees, including the University Board on Diversity and Equality, I have always listened to others first and tried to understand them, before making my point. The commissioner needs to effectively examine the situation from all angles and from all people’s perspectives, even when issues become contentious, in order to reach agreement. The redistricting process must yield a group decision; consequently, the input of every commissioner must be seriously valued.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Having been a college professor for over 25 years at Colorado State University Pueblo, with extensive research experience (I published over 50 scientific articles), I use the scientific method and statistical analysis, and I teach students how to use critical thinking when it comes to solving problems. While department chair and chair of various committees at Colorado State University Pueblo, I have skillfully worked with students, staff and faculty to solve complicated problems. As redistricting commissioners, it is essential that we address the following when we establish working ground rules: What is our primary function as apportioning congressional commission, a process that will impact Colorado for the next 10 years? What are the legal requirements? What are the strengths and weaknesses of current congressional maps? How do we plan to address the issues identified in order to achieve adequate representation of all the different stakeholders in our society, in a mutually respectful environment? How do we listen to one another first with an open mind before formulating our stands? How do we reasonably agree to disagree? What do we agree or disagree with, and why or why not? How do we overcome our biases (because these exist) and navigate this contentions territory? How do we productively capitalize on the expertise of staff and on data made available to the commission? How do we carefully read and analyze pertinent information, including 2020 Census data and computer modeling to reach conclusions based on data and evidence? How do we assign specific tasks to individual commissioners? How do we reach a practical compromise? Most importantly, how does the commission effectively solicit and receive public input in order for voters to actively participate in the process and help develop fair maps that are not skewed to favor a particular party or interest group, and that are best for Colorado as a whole?
