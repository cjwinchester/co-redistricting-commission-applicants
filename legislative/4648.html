<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been a registered Democrat in Colorado since I moved to Denver in 2010. I volunteered for both Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential election and John Hickenlooper’s 2010 and 2014 governor’s races. I donated money to and volunteered for Phil Weiser’s 2018 attorney general campaign and assisted in hosting two fundraising events for him in Garfield County. I donated money to Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 presidential primary campaign, Diane Mitch Bush’s 2020 congressional district campaign, and Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign. I also donated to Democrats running for the Senate in 2020 across the country, including to Gary Peters, Doug Jones, Mike Espy, Jaime Harrison, MJ Hegar, Theresa Greenfield, Cal Cunningham, Sara Gideon, Alan Gross, John Hickenlooper, Jon Ossoff, Barbara Bollier, Raphael Warnock and Steve Bullock. I donated additional funds to Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock’s run-off campaigns for the Georgia Senate seats.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
While my address has changed, I have been a registered Democrat in Colorado since 2010. In 2016, I participated in Colorado Business Committee for the Arts “Leadership Arts” program where I took an intensive ten-week course on how to lead a nonprofit board for arts organizations. I continued my advocacy on behalf of arts organizations by serving on the board of directors of KDNK, a local community access radio station serving listeners from Aspen to Leadville. I serve on the grants committee for KDNK and regularly apply for local and state-wide non-profit grants. When I moved to the Roaring Fork Valley in 2017, I attended a volunteering training course with the Garfield County Democratic Party. I am also a member of the Colorado Bar Association, the Ninth Judicial District Bar Association, and the Colorado Women’s Bar Association.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Since receiving my undergraduate degree, I have focused my energy in the arts by working in arts organizations and advocating for arts as an economic driver. After I completed Colorado Business Committee for the Arts “Leadership Arts”, I continued my advocacy on behalf of arts organizations by being elected to board of directors of KDNK, a local community access radio station. I serve on the grants committee on KDNK and regularly apply to grants in the surrounding areas. During law school, I was the Lead Articles Editor for Colorado Law’s Tech Law Journal. In this role, I organized, edited and helped publish two volumes of the tech law review journal centered around emerging legal issues in the tech field.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Serving on the commission presents an incredibly unique opportunity to participate in the redistricting process in the state of Colorado, to ensure the process of the non-partisan commission goes smoothly and to redistrict with the ideals of democracy at stake. I would like to provide my analytic, reasoning and consensus-building skills to create voter districts that are accurately representative of the community. I want to work with people of different political persuasions to reach consensus on what is best for Colorado. I am also interested in hearing from individuals from different communities and political persuasions on the importance of the redistricting process for them in their individual communities. Not only do I want to participate in the re-districting commission, but I have the analytic and listening skills to be a successful and beneficial participant.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Every day I work in an environment where I need to balance the needs and interests of adverse parties. At its heart, my law practice requires me to build consensus amidst these competing interests. I must understand the goals and motives of my clients, my own team of attorneys, judges, and opposing counsel in order reach favorable outcomes. I must communicate, engage with and listen to differences of opinion on a daily basis, a skill that will help me on the commission. Creating consensus is a key driver in settlement negotiations which occur on a regular basis. I will use these analytic and consensus-building skills on the commission, using logic and reason to develop compatibility among commissioners who may have divergent political views. I will engage with the commissioners and most importantly, listen. I also believe I can be fair and impartial and take my emotions out of this process, which I must do every day in emotional and litigious cases.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My day job requires using analytical skills, applying logic and reason to a problem, and negotiating disputes on behalf of a diverse range of clients. This requires determining the facts of the case, interacting with all parties involved, understanding the legal framework that governs a particular type of dispute, and communicating with all parties involved in order to understand what the case is about. While I mainly practice commercial, land use and municipal litigation, often new cases require me to dive into a new set of law that I have never practiced before. Becoming familiar with a new legal doctrine requires analytic research and writing skills, which I do in order to solve my clients’ problems. My goal is to understand all the perspectives and underlying factual background, after which I must apply logic and reason to argue my case, whether in front of a judge, managing partner, client or opposing partner. Understanding where consensus could be built to solve a particular problem is a critical component of the job and crucial for settlement negotiations.
