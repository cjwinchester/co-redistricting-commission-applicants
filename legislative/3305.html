</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
The Durango 9-R School Board members considered and advocated for the interests and needs of students, teacher, classified staff, business leaders, and tri-ethnic community as a whole (white, Hispanic, Native). Durango has a with a robust interest in how its schools are conducted. Our district is purple, with a liberal seat in town and more conservative-minded folks on the &quot;Dry Side&quot; (more rural/agricultural). Thus, we consider widely varying points of views and differing needs of students and their families. Fort Lewis College, a liberal arts college with vocational programs, has a 40%+ Native American student population and faculty/staff with children, adding its own dimension and diverse perspective. 9-R was the first state district to include our three charter schools in bond issues because those families pay taxes and it&#39;s only fair they be included with the allotment of funds. 
As the former program manager for the local adult education center for the high school equivalency (GED) program, I stalwartly support making educational opportunities available and free/inexpensive for adults who left high school before graduation. An educated Colorado populace creates a stronger, healthier citizenry. I believe in second and third chances for adults gaining more education because I understand that &quot;there but for fortune go I,&quot; and our world requires that we be mentally flexible, nimble, and capable of accepting and embracing a fast-changing world; so much of this depends on our educational system!
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve for the same reasons that I served on the school board while working full-time and holding down an extra job as a PT community college instructor: I love Colorado and want everyone who lives here to thrive and be treated fairly. Complaining about what is wrong with government does nothing to improve its functionality; only putting our shoulders to the wheel to make it turn--no matter how slowly or seemingly imperceptibly--can ultimately effect positive change and improve lives. I grew up in a family of eight children and learned early on that if I wanted to accomplish something, I had better work for it, and my work ethic has served me well. 
As a teacher, I believe in doing homework; while I&#39;m rarely if ever the smartest person in the room, I am sometimes the hardest worker and do a lot of background research to find the best, most accurate solutions or approaches to the issue at hand. I read and absorb information well, make notes, come prepared, and this has been one of the not-so-secret reason for my success, unlike some people in positions of power who have *not* done their homework and make poor decisions based on a kneejerk or purely partisan perspective. This cannot be the case on this critical venture that Colorado is undertaking. Once the Commission achieves its goals, we will have better government; this I believe or I would not be willing to put in the time required. Luckily, I am in great health and have a positive attitude, so I am up to the challenge!
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Without consensus, that wheel I wrote of earlier can jam. In my volunteering, I learned how to listen and take notes as a way to force myself to hear accurately what the speaker is saying. My nearly 8 years on the school board reinforced this skill and while the board did not always reach consensus or meet our superintendent&#39;s exact wishes, we generally functioned well and moved the district forward to strengthen student achievement, pass major bonds and deal with controversial issues well. As a Democrat who believes that clear, factual information is essential, I will help my group, where necessary when we hit difficulties or an impasse, to work through decisions as rationally as possible, not based on an intense personal or political agenda or intractable ideology.
My background as a program manager supervising nine employees also serves me well. The teachers/ support staff occasionally clashed, so I learned how to bring conflicting factions together and had them each tell their story. This alone created empathy and a new willingness to understand the other&#39;s perspective. Listening really does matter; coming prepared really does matter; and being willing to compromise and not having to win at all costs really does matter. We have  many differing communities of interest in our legislative district, but/and I believe we can find ways to meet almost everyone’s needs and interests whether economic or familial or a neighborhood’s driving forces.

Last, I served on a federal jury ten years ago. It was an extraordinary case, and I am proud of how I was able to persuade the lone holdout who did not want to convict the accused rapist; the juror kept asking &quot;why didn&#39;t she [the young woman assaulted] cry out or try to escape?&quot; This gentleman was familiar with only the “flight or fight” condition that people in extreme danger or assault often take; he knew nothing about the &quot;freeze&quot; mentality that occurs, especially with victims of sexual assault. Rather than yelling or telling this juror that he was ignorant or insensitive, I explained quietly about this third &quot;freeze&quot; state, and he was thankful for the information; we returned to the courtroom and convicted a  dangerous, violent person. Letting people voice their concerns, listening well, and responding in a way that shows you heard them--not that you were merely waiting your turn to counter--can move that collective wheel forward so that we accomplish our goal for that session/meeting.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I taught research and essay writing skills, from Parachute, Colorado with fifth graders through to several high school jobs and many colleges, including Pueblo Community College in Durango. These analytical skills transfer to the same kind of work the Commission will be asked to do. We have a problem/challenge to address, so the first step will be the gathering, reading, and digesting of a great amount of information--population demographics, predicted growth/shrinkage of population; changing economic forces and patterns, immigrant influence, rural/urban, industrial/tourism--etc. Just parsing clear and accurate information itself will be a challenge, and that is why having a balanced group of folks is so essential to the whole process. I expect this phase to take several months, and as we meet we will try out possible options/solutions/compromises and listen to the obvious and less apparent counter arguments/points of view. As Donald Rumsfeld pointed out, &quot;there are known knowns...and  known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know.&quot; 
The skill of understanding inference and implication will be useful as will defining our terms and having a full understanding of the history and politicization of the congressional redistricting and other problematic aspects. We will ask ourselves and one another, as well as the Coloradans we visit with across the state, important questions and gather those answers, seeking patterns that reveal potential changes where they will benefit a majority of our citizens without harming communities of interest. We will brainstorm unanticipated consequences of whatever decisions we might arrive at as a group. We will set ground rules/expectations that examine biases and how to put them aside to achieve the greater good of the commission and for the people of our beloved state.
I faced this problem/solution/question just the past few months with friends and colleagues who said that they would sit out the 2020 election, a position I could empathize with but not accept easily. All of the skills I have mentioned are ones I have employed, and I am pleased to say that a few people have left the table saying that they were no longer sure whether they would indeed sit out this election year.
