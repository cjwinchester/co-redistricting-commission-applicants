        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for John D. Gemperline</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  John D. Gemperline
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>NA</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently about to defend my master’s thesis in planetary geology at CU Boulder. At present, I do not have a job lined up post-graduation. My work experience and mapping expertise is highlighted in my attached resume.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I attended UNC Greensboro from 2007-2011 where I earned a BA in Classical Studies, a BA in Geography, and a Minor in Music.
I attended ECU from 2011-2013 where I earned a BS in Geology.
I am currently a Masters Student studying Planetary Geology at CU Boulder and expect to graduate Fall, 2020. My work at CU has focused on mapping planetary surfaces using Geographic Information Systems (ESRI’s ArcGIS) for the United States Geological Survey.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80303
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I donated to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign for president in the Spring of 2020. I have previously contributed to the Human Rights Campaign in 2016.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Since 2016 I have been a member of the Geological Society of America, an academic and professional organization.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I am a dues paying member of United Campus Workers Colorado (UCW), formerly the Committee for Rights and Compensation. UCW began as an entirely graduate student lead organization and later affiliated with the Communication Workers of America, a larger national union that represents 700,000 workers in the public and private sector. As a member of UCW, I have canvassed for union membership among graduate students across various departments on CU Boulder’s campus, attended sit ins and marches to advocate for better graduate student pay and benefits, and the elimination of burdensome student fees that disproportionately affect lower income and minority group students. I have also attended a socially distanced protest at the beginning of Fall 2020 in response to CU opening campus to undergraduate students without proper safety protocols or worker protections.
In the wake of the murder of George Floyd, I attended Black Lives Matter protests in Boulder on May 30th and a march from Aurora to Denver down Colfax on August 30th. I think it is crucial that Black, Latino, and other marginalized groups be given a fair voice in electoral politics, and not have their communities diced up by partisan forces as I’ve seen happen in my home state of North Carolina.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on this commission to use my skills and talents to serve the people of Colorado in creating fair and competitive electoral districts without the stain of partisan meddling. Specifically, my previous experience in creating map products for the United States Geological Survey will be invaluable to my fellow commissioners and the people of this state. I want to engage with the political process and empower every Coloradan to have their voice heard in electoral maps where their votes matter and are not simply stacked to favor or disfavor any party. I personally voted for this measure to pass as I believe competitive voting districts will create a more healthy democracy, and benefit both major political parties by encouraging them to put forward strong, qualified candidates responsible for representing a diverse range of political views from the communities they represent.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The redistricting commission has been given a clear goal of creating voting districts that are competitive, have equal populations, are contiguous, compact, preserve existing communities, and comply with the voting rights act of 1965. These requirements are inherently apolitical and non-partisan. I will ensure that these requirements are commissioners’ only relevant considerations while drawing voting districts. I believe that a growing attitude of tribalism and a desire to win at all costs rising on both sides of the political spectrum is increasingly creating a more rancorous political environment. I believe that having competitive voting districts is healthy and will lead to both major parties running more highly qualified candidates that are answerable to a diverse and mixed electorate. I believe having highly skewed political districts that can act as a “rubber stamp” for incumbent candidates reduces voters’ exposure to their representatives and disincentivizes politicians’ engagement with their own voters. For this reason, I look forward to working with every member of the commission in drawing Colorado’s new voting districts in a professional, level-headed, and genial fashion.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am specifically qualified to create maps that fit the parameters given to the redistricting commission. The past four years of my graduate study have been devoted to drawing a geologic map of the surface of Mercury using ESRI’s ArcGIS. The final product, corresponding map pamphlet and materials have been delivered to the United States Geological Survey’s Astrogeology center in Flagstaff, AZ for publication and has been specifically recognized there as an outstanding submission requiring minimal review or editorial changes. Mapping rocks on the surface of another world and people in into voting districts are clearly two very different endeavors. But the analytical capabilities, my eye for accounting for detail during the production of this map, and the consideration of all the data inputs necessary for compiling a final product are all skills that are easily transferable to this process. Further, as a graduate student at CU Boulder, I have taught a class titled “GIS for Geologists” for three semesters during which I helped undergraduate students learn and develop these skills as well, something that I think will greatly aid my ability to work with the other members of the commission. It is this specific background in drawing maps that made me initially consider applying to this commission, where my talents can serve the ~5.7 million residents of our state.
