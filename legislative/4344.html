<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not donated to any political campaigns or organizations since 2015. My regular political activity includes voting, encouraging others to vote, working with communities to ensure census participation, and thoroughly informing myself on all candidates and issues during each election prior to voting.

I don&#39;t believe these count as political organizations, but out of an abundance of caution, I will list organizations I donate to regularly. I have donated to the United Way each year since 2016 through work, the American Red Cross during major disaster relief work, and the St. John’s College Alumni Association on a monthly basis since 2014.

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Member, American Association of Public Opinion Research
Member, Association of Public Policy Analysis and Management
Member, National Council on Measurement in Education
Member, American Education Research Association
Member, Women in Cable Telecommunications
Member, National Digital Inclusion Alliance

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have learned in my digital inclusion work that it takes communities and partnerships to do hard work and solve complex social problems. My current position brings together industry, policymakers, communities, and non-profits to address the digital divide through grassroots organizing. While the digital divide is a national problem, it is solved on a local level, one household at a time. Prior to this position, my role as a researcher allowed me to work with various groups across Colorado to collect data and provide insights in service of a broader policy goal. For example, while working with the Colorado Education Initiative, I helped construct an instrument that could be used to collect feedback on school principals for districts looking to implement SB-191. That work meant meeting with educators across Colorado to understand how best to construct the instrument and where principals and teachers collaborate to better educational outcomes for their students. After completing and validating the instrument, I was asked to work with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, WestEd, the Colorado Department of Education, and districts of all sizes across Colorado to actually operationalize the work and analyze the results of a pilot study. This project was one opportunity to look on many sides of an issue, bring together relevant research, use my technical skills to provide insights and expertise to communities passionate about the work, and actually report on the results in a way that served multiple stakeholders. 

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Since voting in favor of Amendments Y and Z in 2018, I have looked forward to the opportunity to serve as an independent redistricting committee member on behalf of the citizens of Colorado. I think it is important that when opportunities to serve your community and your state come up that align with your skills and interests, you serve if you are able to do so. Protecting choice, competition, and accountability in the voting process for the people of Colorado is incredibly important, and I believe I have the ability to contribute positively to this work in a fair and impartial way. Should I be chosen to serve as a commissioner, I would do so with the utmost respect for the importance of the commission’s work.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my role with Internet Essentials, I often encounter professionals and community members who also care deeply about their work, but may not agree with me or the policy positions I bring to the table. That said, I have found that in most situations, there is *some* overlap in perspectives, so identifying those areas of overlap and building consensus from a position of shared understanding has been a successful professional strategy for me. Further, I believe that a group of citizens who volunteer to serve on the redistricting commission do so with the best of intentions. Those drawn to this work (either through serving or providing feedback) are likely passionate about the outcome and share my same sense of responsibility to bring their expertise, advocate on behalf of their understanding, and listen to testimony and feedback from individuals across the state. I think we can collaborate to come to a solution that works to the benefit of the people through discussion, building consensus, carefully listening to concerns, and leading with integrity so that others can do the same.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have more than ten years of experience in research methods, quantitative analysis, program evaluation, survey design, and public policy. The majority of this experience has been in service of furthering the educational needs of students in Colorado through my work with the Colorado Department of Education, the Colorado Education Initiative, and at the University of Colorado. More recently, I have broadened my policy experience to include digital inclusion, an issue impacting the economic, workforce, education, and health outcomes of our nation’s most underserved individuals. Throughout these professional experiences, I have developed skills that I think will serve me well while serving on this commission: the use of analytical skills and research to understand complex issues, the analysis of data to determine viable courses of action, and building consensus among stakeholders about the best path forward meeting multiple needs.
