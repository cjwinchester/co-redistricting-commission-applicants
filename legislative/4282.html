        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Jack Donnelly</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Jack Donnelly
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Jack Donnelly III</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Andrew Mellon Professor and Distinguished University Professor, Korbel School of International Studies, University of Denver, 1992-present.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  PhD, University of California Berkeley, 1982.  MA, Georgetown University, 1975.  BSFS Georgetown University, 1973.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80238
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have regularly attended local Democratic caucuses since 2008, once being a delegate to the State convention.  I have contributed small amounts of money ($100 or less) to a modest number of candidates in Colorado, including Andrew Romanoff, John Hickenlooper, Michael Bennett, Jason Crow, Brian Mason, Saira Rao, Jennifer Mitkowski, and probably a couple more that I can&#39;t recall.  I donated more than that to John Walsh last year and would have worked actively on his behalf had he not withdrawn from the race.  Nationally, this year I sent small contributions to Mark Kelly in Arizona and Bill Foster in Illinois (the only member of Congress with a PhD in the natural sciences).
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
None, other than my HOA (where I served as President for two years).  I am not much of a joiner in general and have actively avoided it since my son was born in 2011.  
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My focus has been more professional – I am an internationally known scholar of human rights – and outside of Colorado.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The Commission requires fair-minded people with good analytical skills and a commitment to working with other fair-minded people to produce a map that will be widely perceived as (not un)fair.  And that would be exactly what I would be aiming for.  Although I vote pretty much exclusively for Democratic candidates, I grew up in a time and place (NY in the 1960s) when I worked and voted for Republicans like Jacob Javits, Nelson Rockefeller, and Ogden Reid.  And I wish that we could return to that.  I have no commitment to the Democratic Party as a party.    But I do have a strong commitment to open democratic elections.  I would like to be able to contribute to a nonpartisan process of redistricting that respects the principle of each vote counting equally.  
This is an important initiative that Colorado has undertaken to avoid the perverse gerrymandering that is being practiced in other states.  It requires reasonably large numbers of ordinary citizens to be willing to participate.  I am willing and able to do my part, should I be selected.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I understand the importance not only of allowing everyone to be heard but of assuring that everyone feels that their views have been seriously considered.  This takes time, hard work, and openness.  University faculties are notoriously unruly bodies, but when I have had leadership roles I have been able to manage processes that were inclusive and participatory and thus produced buy-in to the results.  (Most recently, as Chair of the Faculty Council of the Korbel School of International Studies, I have led a project to redesign our system of faculty governance and revise our rules on hiring, tenure, and promotion.  This has required extremely careful attention to details, considerable thought about unintended consequences, and the ability to forge a consensus.  I think that these skills would be directly transferable into the work of the Commission.)
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am a widely-published theoretical social scientist with a sharp analytical mind, committed to empirical, conceptual, and theoretical rigor, and an ability to harmonize details of an analysis or argument with broad theoretical conceptions.  And I am equally effective in talking to groups of ordinary citizens and writing highly abstract professional articles.  The work of the Commission will involve taking a very simple idea – each vote should count equally – and some simple basic guidelines and then working through the implications of alternative ways to achieve this end.  This is closely analogous to the heart of what I do in both my teaching and my scholarship.
