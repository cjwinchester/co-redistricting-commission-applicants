<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Intercambio Uniting Communities (intercambio.org).
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have no experience in organizing, representing, or advocating for groups, organizations, or associations in Colorado.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I think that our democracy would be stronger if the lines of each state legislative district and federal congressional district were drawn in away that included people of diverse economic status, occupations, cultural backgrounds, political philosophies, genders, races, and sexual orientations in proportion to the representation of these groups in the Colorado population as a state. It seems to me that office holders elected to represent such districts would, in order to be elected, have to consider the interests of all these groups, thereby promoting comprise, a cornerstone of democracy, I believe. I also believe that securing and maintaining a strong democracy demands something from all its citizens, and I understand that there is a clear need for an adequate number of good applicants to the Independent Redistricting Commissions to insure their success, which I fervently hope for. I believe that I could contribute meaningfully to the success of aRedistricting Commission. I take my inspiration from the Roman statesman Cincinnatus who left his farm to answer a call to duty in the defense of the Republic, but who, after accomplishing his mission, immediately relinquished power to return to the life of a citizen farmer. I do not seek power or gain for myself or any party, I simply want to see a good job done on these important tasks.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Before meeting with other Redistricting Commission members I will study the issues, and form my own thoughts about what constitutes good district boundaries and the best course for the commission to achieve these. However, when I meet with my fellow commissioners I WILL FIRST LISTEN to their ideas on these items so that I can get a fuller understanding of the ways to achieve the commission&#39;s goals. In meetings I will seek to contribute by asking questions and prompting members to carefully state the advantages and disadvantages of their suggestions along with evidence to support their positions. I will work to make sure that the ideas of all members are heard. I will have no problem being fair or impartial, because I strongly believe that unless the citizens of the democracy believe that the people serving in its government offices (including these commissions) are fair, the success of the democracy is jeopardized.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My education in mathematics and physics required me to develop very strong analytical skills to attain my degrees, and my subsequent career as a Systems Engineer exercised not only these skills but also showed me how to apply them to real life problems whose conditions don&#39;t often match the simple situations of problems posed in text books.
