<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated money to Colorado Freedom Force in 2020.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Colorado Swimming, Chair of Governance Committee
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As the Chair of the Governance Committee for Colorado Swimming, our committee is responsible for ensuring fairness, transparency and ethics throughout the organization. We do this by ensuring that policies are in place to protect all stakeholders including teams, coaches and athletes. My committee was also involved in several ad-hoc committees in relation to COVID-19 ensuring that teams were able to make it through the turbulent times.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that fair and equal representation at the State and Federal level is critical.  Every constituent has differing needs and economical climates that require lawmakers and representatives to consider when fighting for or against bills and prospective legislation. Gerrymandering hurts constituents on both sides, because instead of representatives working for their constituents and the needs of that area, lines are drawn to further party politics. With the broad differences in socio-economic climate and the differences in source of revenue across the state. Representatives should be chosen not to bolster seats but instead to accurately represent the constituents in that area.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a leader and business owner, I am constantly looking to make decisions in the best interest of all my stakeholders. Unlike a traditional business, profit doesn&#39;t always drive our decision making. Our primary goal is to impact the kids that we serve. I have multiple program directors all vying for resources to expand and grow. Many times we have to sit down with all program directors and really talk about where the resources need to go to make the biggest impact in our community. We have made the decision as a business and a team to never turn away a kid for financial reasons, and to this day we have not. We have provided over $50,000 in scholarships. We do not make those decisions based on political party, skill of the child, etc. We make decisions in the best interest of those that we serve and that would be my number on goal if chosen for this commission.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Managing a small business and coaching athletes requires the ability to solve problems. We are constantly looking at numbers and data to not only figure out ways to help our athletes improve, but also strategize how we can work within the community more effectively. I have always loved research. I want to make sure that I am always making research backed decisions, not decisions based rawly on gut feeling or emotion. I promise that if selected for this commission that I will thoroughly review all available data and fight for decisions that can be backed by the numbers and data.
