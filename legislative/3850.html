<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
None.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Weir Gulch Gardens Neighborhood Association, Lakewood, CO 
Parent Teachers Association, Belmar School of Integrated Arts, Lakewood, CO
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
For many years I was a journalist, so did not advocate for or belong to any organizations/interests. Since then, I have volunteered to assist refugees/asylees in metro Denver.  I recently helped create a new neighborhood association in my neighborhood.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I wish to be of public service. As an immigrant and naturalized citizen, I am appreciative of the freedoms and responsibilities we have as citizens.  I appreciate the need to truly listen to many points of view and learn from people of all backgrounds on this important issue. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe in compromise. In a process like redistricting, no party will get everything they want.  But we should agree on facts and use the same data when making determinations about representation.  From there, we will encounter different points of view, but through discussion, we can build understanding, and through that, build consensus.  I&#39;m also a mom of two young kids - I am forced to turn disagreement into consensus every day. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Research, attention to detail, and effective communication have played a big role in my work. These are important skills for the members of the redistricting commissions. 
There are not only two sides to an issue - but many diverse points of view.  As a journalist, digging through data and analyzing information was necessary in order to uncover problems and/or trends. Iâ€™ve spent many hours reading through public documents and attending public hearings - listening to testimony and debate. My first job in public radio was covering the Illinois State Legislature as I worked on my masters degree in Public Affairs Reporting.   I truly enjoyed my many years as a journalist - engaging with people, conducting interviews, studying a complex issue and finding an engaging way to explain it to listeners, often broadcast in under 5 minutes. 

After the birth of my second child, I became a patient consultant for Kaiser Permanente Colorado for two studies dealing with maternal mental health after contacting the author of a survey that was emailed to me regarding prenatal and postpartum depression. I outlined the issues I had obtaining mental health care from my medical provider, and was subsequently invited to provide my point of view to a couple of research teams working on programs to better assist other new mothers. We talked a lot about how our experiences would differ based on income, location in the state, language spoken and citizenship status. Even though we did not have all kinds of mothers represented in person in our discussions, we worked hard to keep their experiences in mind.  

Listening is key to finding solutions. When I started volunteering for a newly-created, all-volunteer free food, clothing, and supply pantry in Aurora for newly resettled refugees, we had no funding, limited space, and little structure. Several of us worked together to create a space that would allow Coloradans to share their resources with their new neighbors. We constantly had to retool our efforts after listening to what the people we were trying to help wanted and needed...what was working in our effort to create a safe, welcoming space, and what wasnâ€™t. We learned a great deal.
