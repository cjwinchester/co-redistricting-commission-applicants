</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
As a council-appointed member of the Colorado Springs 2020 Districting Process Advisory Committee, I represented the fastest growing district of over 81,000 people-- a population slightly larger than Loveland. My role included soliciting input on the proposed boundaries, conducting the public outreach meeting, and synthesizing the comments for the committee report. I also worked with my fellow committee members and studied maps of demographic information to ensure that neighborhoods with a higher number of ethnic minorities were fairly represented in our recommendations for redistricting.

</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been a regular voter in Colorado since 1994. In the past I was affiliated with the Republican Party so I could vote in the local primaries. In 2008, I affiliated with the Democratic Party to support the candidacy of Barack Obama and became a neighborhood precinct chairman to further his candidacy. In 2014, I changed my voter registration and became an unaffiliated voter. In the interest of full disclosure, I have made no donations to candidates, political parties, or political action committees in the 2020 election cycle.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Member of the City of Colorado Springs 2020 Districting Process Advisory Committee. Member of the Pikes Peak Rural Transportation Authority (PPRTA) Citizens Advisory Committee. Member of a citizen-led neighborhood group exploring how to fix the inequities in the property tax structure of the Briargate Special Improvement Maintenance District. Registered adult volunteer with the Boy Scouts of America (Pikes Peak Council). Outreach Committee Chairman with Bike Colorado Springs, a fiscally-sponsored group of the non-profit Trails and Open Space Coalition. 

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I pledge to the citizens of Colorado to deliver on the requirements of the state constitution to the best of my abilities. My goal will be to ensure that the inaugural commission will become the gold standard for independent redistricting commissions in the nation. I acknowledge that this will not be an easy task because our highly mobile society has allowed us to sort ourselves into clusters of like-minded neighbors of similar demographics and income levels. Despite our competing interests, the citizens of Colorado are calling for the highest standards and have rejected having their elections be decided by partisan computer algorithms that dilute their voice in good government. I see my role as a commissioner to objectively and impartially implement the new constitutional requirements for equitable and competitive election districts.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
It is remarkable to witness the wisdom emerge from a diverse group of reasonable and intelligent individuals working toward a common goal. Being part of a group starts with humility and an understanding that no one individual has all the answers. Forming consensus requires preparation, amending oneâ€™s opinion when presented with new information, putting into practice the principles of active listening, and ensuring that all voices are heard. Consensus is not unanimous consent but rather an outcome built on mutual respect, judicious deliberation, and authentic inclusion of minority viewpoints.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am a software engineer who likes facts and data. Using math and logic to create solutions is my profession. I strive to be a System 2 Thinker. In 2014 I served as an expert witness on a complex patent case in federal district court involving database security which required deep analysis of the subject matter and an understanding of the law. Since July 2020 I have applied my analytical skills to assist the Colorado Springs City Clerk with redistricting the City Council District boundaries based on election precincts and demographic data for a city of approximately 481,000 residents. I created web-based maps using shapefiles and GIS software to help my colleagues on the advisory committee better understand the relationship between the proposed district boundaries and the local communities of interest.
