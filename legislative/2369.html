<h5>Educational Background</h5>

I graduated from Cottage Grove High School in Cottage Grove, Oregon in 1973, pursued a Lumber Secretary certificate at Lane Community College in Eugene, OR, and have taken classes from Colorado Mountain College in Steamboat Springs, CO, and Hillsdale College in Hillsdale, Michigan.  
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I helped to run my employer&#39;s State Senate campaign in Montana in the 1970&#39;s.  I&#39;ve donated small amounts to numerous organizations over the years, but the only political ones I know of were Madison Cawthorn&#39;s campaign, the Heritage Foundation (is that political?) and some to winred.org this fall.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
North Park Community Heart &amp; Soul, Jackson County Lodging Tax Panel, Jackson County Council on Aging, Club 20, NW Colorado Council of Governments Economic Development District Board, NW Loan Committee, CRAFT Champion for Colorado Tourism Office, North Park Area Chamber of Commerce, Larimer County CASA, Jackson County Lions Club, North Park Woman&#39;s Club, and the Great West Working Group
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My volunteer work is mostly done to benefit children, the elderly, the handicapped and forgotten or left out minorities in my community.  Our Heart &amp; Soul work capitalizes on involving everyone and focusing on what matters most to the individuals in our county.  I work one-on-one with many, from government officials down to those who have been incarcerated or are home-bound by age or handicap.  One of my volunteer duties is providing transportation for elderly or handicapped individuals who must travel 65 to 150 miles one way for doctor appointments or for a pharmacy.  Another is to act as a court-appointed special advocate (CASA) for abused or neglected children.  I&#39;ve worked with special needs students in the school system and a local youth group, and I regularly advocate for our community in larger settings to obtain grants, donations and help for the myriad needs in our small, remote, rural area.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
We live in a very unique area that is regularly under-represented due to the need to travel extensive distances for meetings.  A great number of our residents live at or below the poverty level, and lack for many basic services generally afforded persons living in more economically developed communities with higher populations.  We do not have the representation needed in our State government, since we are often lumped in with urban and suburban groups, or high-end resort communities.  Perhaps that is the way it is destined to be, but I am interested in the process, and how the decisions are made for communities such as ours.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my work with local government officials at the town, county and state level, I am an earnest listener who is patient and kind during heated exchanges, proposing ideas that are sometimes &quot;out of the box&quot; in a level-headed way.  Having lived here for many years, I do understand that some things are impossible, and that is the price we pay to live in this beautiful, remote location, so I firmly believe in the power of community and in working together to care for our neighbors.  In a conflict, I personally approach the individuals involved, to gain information and empathize with each one&#39;s perspective.  If I hear that someone is upset with me, I am quick to go to them and find out what I have said or done to bring division, and correct the problem however I can.  As a business owner, I am frequently called upon to solve problems, judge impartially, and bring solutions with employees, customers and vendors.  Many times, I&#39;ve brought a peaceful ending to a seemingly unsolvable problem in my family, my work and my community.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My daily operations as a business owner, mother and grandmother demand these skills in many ways, as I help to run a successful business, homeschool my children, volunteer in my community, and seek to make life better for those suffering around me.  Throughout the course of my life I&#39;ve had to make logical decisions, sometimes to survive the brutal, extended winters here, 65 miles from the nearest town in any direction, or in the event of an accident where there is no cell service or emergency assistance.  I grew up on a remote homestead in Montana, where I learned coping and survival skills within a large family in a poverty situation and a mentally ill, abusive parent who was addicted to numerous substances.  I am an overcomer, and these life experiences have broadened my understanding and reasoning, and shown me the importance of analyzing the situation and applying logic and reason, instead of reacting emotionally under pressure or stress.
