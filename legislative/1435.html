<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have principally been involved in the pro bono legal representation of interests throughout the NE Denver community, as a member of leadership of the DBA and CBA, and through the pro bono programs of my law firms (Rothgerber &amp; BHFS), the Metro Volunteer Lawyers programs/clinics, the Colo. Lawyers Comm. programs/clinics, and the Sam Cary Bar Association.  I was a longtime member of/advocate for the programs of Greater Park Hill Community Inc. when I lived in that community (1974-2004), and have recently been a pro bono advisor to Our Lady of Visitation Community of N Denver, whose parish was dissolved by the Denver Catholic ArchDiocese in May of 2017.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have significant experience with the previous redistricting process, as the lead trial attorney for the City of Aurora in Moreno, et.al. vs. Gessler, the 2011 redistricting proceeding in the Denver District Court which created the first Congressional District (District 6) wherein the entire City of Aurora was, for the first time, included within a single Congressional district.  I worked with a Republican City Council and Mayor to convince them that a negotiated plan advocated for by the CO Democratic Party was in the City&#39;s best interests, because it offered the long-sought-after single-District status; and I and my partners @ BHFS successfully secured that status through appeals to the CO Supreme Court.  I saw and appreciated then the great significance for every citizen in how a fair and census-compliant re-districting plan affects the entire 10-year horizon of affected communities and interest groups; and I am convinced that a full and inclusive discussion of how re-districting will and can empower the voices of citizens and their communities of interest can result in a plan for the future that produces the greatest good for the greatest number of citizens, even in a rapidly changing demographic.  I believe in, and believe I can uniquely facilitate, this most important of periodic civic engagements for this growing state and its expanding Front Range communities.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that I understand consensus-building on a regional scale - and know that I have broad experience in reaching such consensus by extending a hand in dialogue to, and creating vehicles for dialogue with, a range of those interest groups whose purposes sometime appear to conflict.  I have done this work on a broad local, and sometimes a state-wide scale  -  beginning with my role as Chair of the State Parks Board when the first proposals were made for limited gambling in CO [with proceeds to be dedicated to State and local parks and recreation development], through my years on the Denver Water Board as the region struggled with water supply and metro cooperation implications of permitting for, and denial of the permit for the Two Forks Reservoir Project, through my 15-year service on the Board of Stapleton Foundation and the controversies embroiling the former Stapleton Airport enclave and its transformation to a &quot;new town&quot; community within the City/County of Denver, to confronting the continued challenges of health care for the poor and underserved throughout the state as Chair of the Denver Health Board - I believe I have demonstrated my ability to hear the desires of many and find consensus among them, while working across political party lines.  It&#39;s my belief the the mandated Commission structure, and its scheduled hearings across many parts of the state, will give me a full opportunity to hear from and interact with those interest groups that most require a focus of the Commission toward consensus.
