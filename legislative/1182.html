        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Alexander Lemmel</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Alexander Lemmel
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Controller - StoneAge, Inc.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Bachelor&#39;s of Science in Accounting from Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, OH, graduated 2010); Active Certified Public Accountant license CPA.50213 (Ohio, issued July 2013)
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81301
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated to the following presidential campaigns: Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, and Hillary Clinton. I have also donated to the Ohio Democrats, the Colorado Democrats, and the National Democrats. I have also donated to multiple voting rights projects as I believe that voting for eligible individuals should be as easy as it is in Colorado.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am an active member with the League of Women Voters of La Plata County. I am the Board Treasurer for Big Brother’s Big Sisters of Southwestern Colorado. I also volunteer as an Alumni Ambassador for my alma mater to prospective undergraduate students. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have worked on an education and advocacy campaign to support Amendment B with the League of Women Voters. I also spoke to the Chamber of Commerce to explain the pros and cons of Amendment B. I believe it is very important to understand all sides of an argument, even the ones you oppose, because it helps to develop an empathetic and informed response.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The commission needs qualified, diverse voices represented on the commission. I am at the intersection of diverse voices as a young person, a member of the LGBTQ+ community, and as someone who lives in the rural Western Slope. Multiple studies have shown that diverse teams perform better in the corporate world, that diversity is a competitive advantage, and that diverse boards outperform shareholder return compared to their less diverse competition. Why is that? From my personal experience, diversity often means you live through adversity. The skills I learned to overcome personal and professional challenges are well suited for this commission. I have learned patience knowing that I may be the first nonelective representative of my community an individual has ever met. I learned conflict resolution knowing that my beliefs may be opposite of someone I am close to, like a client or my parents, and yet we still need to have a functional relationship. I have learned advocacy realizing that health insurance policies may not include my partner, and no one may even know it is an issue until you speak to it. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a CPA and a former auditor, one of the values I take very seriously is professional skepticism – the idea that you keep your mind questioning and critical. Auditors learn extensively about biases such as availability, anchoring, overconfidence, confirmation, and rush-to-solve. I learned not only how to recognize these in our audit procedures, but also how to mitigate them. I believe in questioning results regardless of who they favor, and especially if they favor my expectation. Understanding bias will be critically important to the redistricting commission as presumably there is an inherent risk towards gerrymandering, regardless of political affiliation. Understanding bias alone, however, will not help the commission. It requires someone to ask why a certain result make sense. I offer to contribute my ability to ask those difficult questions with patience and empathy. 

I have experience running the budgeting process of a mid-sized private company with over fifteen budget managers. I have learned that running an effective budget process often requires transparency with your budget managers, showing the full pictures, and having frank conversations about where adjustments need to be made. It requires facilitating brainstorming sessions to see how one person can help another or helping negotiate with other departments or third parties. In the end the budget needs to reflect the strategic and financial goals, as well as the values, of the company. The redistricting commission shares similarities: the end goal is to reflect the values of the voters. It means facilitating the conversation so that when the results come together, the participants share agreement to it.
