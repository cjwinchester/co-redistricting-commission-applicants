        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Marc Rocco Bellantoni</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Marc Rocco Bellantoni
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Marc Bellantoni</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Director of Business Development for the San Luis Valley Development Resources Group. Business Loan Fund and Enterprise Zone Administrator. Resume attached. I took a new position with the SLVDRG at the beginning of October. I have not yet updated my resume to reflect this new position but the duties are nearly identical to those I had at the UAADC, I&#39;m just doing it in a different region.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration. Concentrations of accounting and finance. Minor in political science with a focus of protest, dissent and social change. Experience in economic development, helping to build sustainable and resilient economies in rural Colorado.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81226
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have never donated to a political organization in my life. My work requires me to remain apolitical, therefore, I do not engage in much political activity. My main political activity is voting. I vote in every election: local, state or national. I consider myself an educated voter because I think being an uneducated voter is a detriment to our democracy. It does not take very much effort to be aware of the issues facing our country.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am active with EDO&#39;s (Economic Development Organizations) in Colorado. The vast majority of these are nonprofit 501 (c)6&#39;s therefore I do not think they qualify as a political, civic or community organizations.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I am regularly required to represent and advocate for small businesses in rural Colorado. I have done this with the Department of Revenue, Office of Economic Development and International Trade and Department of Local Affairs. I have worked closely with government officials at state and local levels to advocate for rural small businesses and complete projects of various nature. While at the Upper Arkansas Area Development Corporation (UAADC), I worked with the Department of Local Affairs (DOLA) to obtain a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) in order to further capitalize the business loan fund that I was tasked with managing. While applying for the CDBG, it is required that you demonstrate how the funds will be used to assist low-moderate income persons in the region. I used demographic information as well as my prospective loan applicant list to represent the potential low-moderate income jobs that could be created with the funds. While at the same position, I worked closely with the Office of Economic Development and International Trade (OEDIT) to administer economic development programs in the region, including the Colorado Enterprise Zone and Rural Jump Start Program. For each of these programs I must strongly advocate for rural small businesses that are the recipients of the program benefits. Often, the front range sees the vast majority of government investment and it takes voices like the UAADC and SLVDRG to ensure rural is not forgotten. We regularly must remind our urban counterparts that there is value in rural Colorado, it simply does not look the same as on the front range. Now at the San Luis Valley Development Resources Group (same work, different organization/region), I still work closely with DOLA and OEDIT but I also get to work with the Economic Development Administration (EDA) and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). I will continue to advocate for small business in rural Colorado. If small business truly is the backbone of this country, we cannot forget the rural ones. They deserve fair and equal representation too.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Fair and equal congressional representation is a fundamental principal of the democracy we have in United States of America. We vote and elect officials to accurately represent our interests and values at a higher level of government. These representatives are supposed to vote in accordance with these values of their constituents. This is simply not happening as it should be because of gerrymandering. The practice of gerrymandering has created unbalanced representation in our government. It is time for &quot;regular citizens&quot;, to take action and become a part of the solution. I&#39;m tired of standing by and letting the those in power make all the decisions for our democracy. Last I checked, democracies were for and by the people. I thought we put politicians in power to serve us, not the other way around. Other than voting, this is the first time I can been given a chance to directly benefit our democracy and it&#39;s exhilarating.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
If chosen to serve on the commission, I will encourage my fellow commissioners to set aside any personal political beliefs and remember what we are tasked with doing. Congressional redistricting, ensuring congressional districts are drawn to fairly and equally represent all constituents of a region in congress, is a seemingly simple task but requires focus, empathy and patience. I will not let the process be derailed by tangent conversations or personal beliefs. I can remain impartial; it is required of me on a day to day basis. I must review various program applications from businesses from all political spectrums and consider each one individually. I must consider only the objective facts of each application such as financial records, demographic data, and market research. This work has made me realize the importance of having apolitical offices and practices in our government.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Effective rural business/economic development is not a series of individual projects or subjective &quot;best guesses&quot;. These are fallacies that I encounter daily. People in my line of work spend a lot of my time reading news or scholarly articles, talking with local officials and businesses, and researching various topics. We must establish a fundamental understanding of new subjects in a relatively short amount of time. I am proficient at verifying credible news sources, reviewing demographic information for trends, and analyzing financial records for viability as well as other various analytical practices. I then take all of this information and use it to make a decision on one loan application or one tax credit application. I filter through a plethora of information to ensure businesses have the tools they need to be successful in an environment which can be difficult to survive, let alone thrive. I use this information to strategically target regions or projects that have a high probably of qualifying for my programs and support. This allows me to effectively use my time to make the biggest impact. Considering the organization I work for utilizes some taxpayer money, I need to make sure I am a good steward of such. I consider myself a logical and reasonable person. I find the best way to remain logical/reasonable is to be calm and patient. The first answer is not always the best answer and the best answer is not always a simple or easy one (I find that it is usually harder than we think).
