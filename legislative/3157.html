<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Like many others in Denver, I am not a Colorado native. I moved here for my job in political organizing in 2013, and promptly fell in love with the state. So, while I did not grow up here, Colorado is my chosen home and where I plan to live and raise my family for many years to come.

Since I plan to stay in Colorado indefinitely, being an active member of the community, and fighting for all of Coloradan&#39;s interests is incredibly important to me. My initial work in the state kept me very active with local interest groups, including Environment Colorado and CoPIRG. I have since served as a fellow and a board member for New Leaders Council in Denver, which brings together progressive community leaders from across the state. In my current work with the Boston Consulting Group, I have had opportunities to help convene business leaders from across the state to discuss how local corporations can take a bigger role in Colorado Society -- whether advocating for additional low-cost housing options, or convening a rapid response for restaurants to the COVID crisis.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Contributing to the democratic process, and supporting our local community, is deeply important to me, and underlies my career and personal decisions to date. I firmly believe there is nothing as important as ensuring that our democracy works for all citizens, and to do that, all Coloradans, regardless of party or geography, deserve equal representation in their government. That is why a non-partisan redistricting commission is so important, and why I am ready, willing, and able to commit as much time and energy as required to ensure the new process works for all. 

In addition to my commitment, I also believe I will bring important skills and perspective to the process. My professional experience spans the non-profit and for-profit sectors, and has required me to develop the ability to work alongside others with vastly different backgrounds and outlooks towards common goals. I recognize it is a privilege to be able to commit the time and resources to the commission, especially as a young working woman, and would be honored to add my voice to the process.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that everyone brings a unique perspective to the table from their personal experiences, but with that perspective can come biases. What is more important is to recognize where your background, experience, or personal opinions may be affecting your perspective, and be willing to weight the impartial data over that perspective when needed. 

I also believe that everyone applying for this commission, no matter their background, shares the common goal of allowing fair and accurate representation of ALL Coloradans in their government. The key to creating agreement then among commissioners will be to start with that shared goal, and return to it as the north star throughout the process. As discussed below, once the goal is agreed upon, I also think it is critical to align on process and structure for decision making, so any debate or argument is spent on creating a more effective solution, rather than sidetracked by critiquing methods. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My academic and work experience have equipped me with extensive analytical and problem solving skills that I would bring to the commission. My academic background is in the sciences, where I have used mapping and statistical tools such as GIS and R, and understand the output of those tools. In my recent work with BCG, I am responsible for helping companies analyze ambiguous data, and come to the best solution with often imperfect information (using tools such as Excel, Tableau, Alteryx daily, among others). In the past year alone, I have helped a fortune 100 company re-organize geographic divisions based on staff and client locations, identified over $50M in operations savings for a major health organization, and assisted in policy analysis and sustainability strategy for a large global winery. In each of these situations, the ability to frame the question or problem in the beginning, and apply logic and reason to the process was paramount. A robust process not only allows you to come to an adequate solution, but also builds critical trust among stakeholders and buy-in in the answer along the way.
