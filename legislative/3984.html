<h3>Contact Information</h3>

  Mary Jo Hansen
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Jo Hansen</span></p>

  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently retired from an amazing lifelong career as an educator.  I was a professional school counselor at Centennial High School in Pueblo, CO, beginning in 2001.  I retired in 2014, then did a transition year at Central High School, also in Pueblo District 60.  I taught Consumer and Family Studies and Science before becoming a school counselor.  
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Master of Arts degree in School Counseling, Adams State University, 2000;  Master of Arts in Young Adult Ministry, Fordham University, 1988; teaching endorsement, University of Northern Colorado, 1979; Bachelor of Science in Textile Design, Colorado State University, 1978

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Door-to door canvassing is my strongest suit, as I enjoy meeting and engaging with people.  Over the years, I have volunteered in various local and state campaigns.  During this Covid  election year, I made phone calls for the Mitsch-Busch, Biden and Hickenlooper campaigns.  As the past Legislative Committee chair of the Colorado School Counselor Association, I collaborated to organize the Annual School Counselor Day at the Capital event over several years, and helped prepare students to testify to various state legislative committees regarding  bills to support School Counselors and other educators.
I donated to the campaign of Hilary Clinton in 2016, Joe Biden and John Hickenlooper in 2020.

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Working on the board of the Colorado School Counselor Association (CSCA) before retiring from School Counseling was the professional privilege of my career.  Our model is one of co-leadership, so as the President-elect, President, and immediate Past-President, (a 3 year term) two colleagues and I co-led the board and state-wide organization.  Among our accomplishments were doubling the organization’s membership, advocating for numerous legislative initiatives for educators, and providing world-class professional development for professional school counselors throughout the state.    On an individual level, the work of a school counselor is always about advocating for systemic change within schools and districts in order to bring about equity for students.   
Since retiring I have become more involved in volunteer opportunities, among them Volunteers for Community in Colorado City. We are a non-profit serving mainly underrepresented folks in a tri-county area in many capacities, from Food Distribution to helping in the schools and public library, to building trails in the area.  Alongside our regular activities, we are currently building a Community Center multi-use building for the Greenhorn Valley. I have participated in many projects and chaired an Annual Community Fundraising event for three years, collaborating in planning, organizing and carrying out the event which earned, on average, $7000.    
Similarly, as a board member of the Centennial High School Foundation, I continue to be a valued team member.  I engaged a 15 person steering Committee in collaborative planning for our biennial fundraiser event.  We carried through the event which raised nearly $40,000 for students in need.    As president-elect, I will be working to develop projects which both preserve the 144 year legacy of alumni and community tradition and support current students.  Centennial High is both my alma mater and where I spent the most rewarding years of my working career.    I am invested in its legacy and the future of its students in paying forward what I received.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
They say charity begins at home.  Pueblo County has been my home for most of my life.  My initial interest in applying is based on the way that Pueblo has been eclipsed in the Congressional redistricting.  We do not have true representation, as we have very little in common with the entire Western slope.  Taking the wider view, I imagine we are not the only community experiencing a similar issue, so I believe you need commissioners who will advocate for the state to be redistricted in a more fair and balanced manner.   My background as a school counselor is in advocating, for students, for systemic change; I am accustomed to being a voice for those marginalized.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am a cradle Democrat (born in Durango where my grandmother was the Democratic Caucus chair) married to a Republican with Libertarian leanings.  I have been known to listen to NPR and Rush Limbaugh during the same commute to Pueblo.    Though the ensuing whiplash is sometimes off-putting, I have learned that listening to both sides is the best way to discern what is my own truth.  The ability to be fair and impartial is absolutely necessary in my pursuit of both truth and a happy home!   My school counselor training provided theory and practice in conflict mediation and consensus building. I practice empathy in my everyday life, it was the core of my training as a counselor.  Understanding another’s perspective is the key to collaboration, and being able to communicate that understanding creates the space for the necessary teamwork to occur.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I hold two Masters’ degrees, one in theology, the other in school counseling.  I wrote a thesis in earning one of them, took comprehensive exams in earning the other.   As part of each, statistical research was a prerequisite, including courses in statistics.  However, where I “earned my stripes” in data analysis was in my career as a school counselor.  I transitioned from classroom teaching to counseling as educators were discovering data-driven decision-making.  The School Counseling National Model provided the impetus for training with and using data, and inspired our new motto, “In God we trust, all others bring data”.  We learned to make our decisions based on data because we found that led to the strategies for best serving students’ needs.  It completely changed the way we conducted our work on a daily basis and transformed outcomes for our students.
