<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
There are too many to mention, some are listed in my letter of intent, however, there is little mention of my pursuits on the Auraria campus.  This is a community of staff, students, professors and administrators.  Because I was a single mother, I had to find an innovative way to attend college; as a State employee, I was able to downgrade and transfer to the college.  While working full time for the college, I attended classes part-time on my lunch hour and after work.  This supplied me with two perspectives on higher education - as a staff person and as a student. Within a couple years, state employment found me managing academic departments, and holding a classified staff senator position, representing Colorado state employees on campus.  The next year, I joined the Chicano Faculty &amp; Staff organization, becoming the Secretary, and by the end of 1996 I began a chapter of the National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies, promoting the injection of ethnic studies into the CDE&#39;s K-12 curriculum.  During these years, I collaborated and joined other student organizations, La Xicana and MechA, in an effort to recruit and retain minority students on campus.  Our prize project was the La Alma de la Raza Curriculum Project, financed by President Clinton&#39;s Goals 2000 Grant program.  And during all this advocating, I obtained and developed new skills - the drafting of curriculum, the handling/bookkeeping of large and small state academic budgets, academic student recruitment, the handling of faculty searches, the hiring of part-time faculty, and interestingly, the handling of graduation agreements.  In 1998/9 a new venture was undertaken, teaching other MSCD employees and student staff on the operations of the BANNER database.  Technology came to campus and database experts were in need.
</p>

In COLORADO ONLY: 2020 - small donations to various Democratic Senate and State Representatives across the nation.   2019- Canvass for School Board candidates, Alexis Menocal Harrigan.  2018-  Canvass for Mike Johnston, for Governor; Diana DeGette, US House District 1. 1996-2000 volunteer at Dist.1 State Senator &amp; Councilman&#39;s Community Office; canvass for various school board candidates.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My pursuit of this position is largely due to my professional and educational backgrounds; where I’ve worked and lobbied to assure communities are instituted and planned to meet their safety and well-being needs.  Truthfully, I&#39;ve spent a good portion of my life obtaining an education, and I&#39;d like to put it to use; as the student loans continually remind me of it.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a state environmental and educational employee, I&#39;ve always had to promote a consensus of the administration&#39;s pursuit to create a good, safe and clean learning environment.  Working in the public sector can provide either great satisfaction or disarray; as a representative of our government, I feel, it is my duty to assure a consensus is not just heard, but heeded, by our administrators.  If disarray is visualized or experienced, advocates should be supplied to counter or meet the disorganization/disagreement.   Consensus is achieved by finding the middle ground, ideas that meet both or all parties needs; then working toward a mutual agreement on those outliers, merging them or redefining them, possibly allowing a better consensus.  Being impartial can be difficult when it comes to meeting the demands and needs of children and the elderly, they are so vulnerable and require our steadfast and consistent support but their needs should not revoke or overshadow the needs and rights of our younger more vibrant portion of the community - our workforce.  Without our workers/drones, we&#39;d not have a hive/community or a queen bee (leader) to serve.  Fairness is a subjective concept which was consistently taught to me, as I grew up in Denver, during the Civil Rights Movement era; attending parochial school where the Sisters bellowed the importance of integrity and measuring the variables in the discussion; to think of the consequences, before making a decision. And those lessons have been learned and put into action, many times over the years.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My Masters of Science in Public Policy should be enough relevancy to assure I&#39;m able to not only use but understand the systematic analysis of issues related to public policy and the decision processes associated with them. This would include the studies and training in the role of economic and political factors in public decision-making and policy formulation; microeconomic analysis [econometrics]  of policy options and issues; their resource allocation and decision models; cost/benefit analysis; and statistical and research methods.
