<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I vote in every election. I served as a delegate to the Gilpin County Democratic Convention for the 2020 presidential election but then submitted a proxy due to the pandemic. I donated to the following campaigns: Democratic Party, Cary Kennedy, Mark Kelly, Amy McGrath and Cory Booker. I contributed to the League of Conservation Voters and Environmental Defense. 
</p>

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I do not have direct experience in organizing, representing or advocating for specific groups. I have served in volunteer leadership positions but the focus was not on advocacy. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am committed to the work of this commission. I voted for it. The work of this commission reflects the will of the people to take political bias out of the process to the extent possible. Although the task will not be easy, I believe that a process that is transparent, fair and logical will provide Coloradans with a better outcome, supported by more people than the previous political process. I believe that legislative boundaries drawn to unfairly benefit one party over another create greater political division and alienation. I have skills to offer to this effort, and I want to be a part of it.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I developed an appreciation through my professional and volunteer experiences for group projects. People working together to solve complex problems can create innovative solutions and move projects to successful completion. I have a recent example. As president of the Swayback Ranch Fishing Club, I helped guide the board to the completion of a complex land transfer. I  encouraged the board to actively listen and acknowledge the concerns that others expressed. We explored solutions within the mission and legal framework of the project. The board&#39;s work was transparent and welcoming. At the end of the project, all knew that they were heard and respected. The group shared a common commitment to the process, the organization and to completion of the project. We could work with that to hammer out the details together. I firmly support the commission&#39;s task and the need to be fair and impartial, which are foundational to the work. I understand and support the difference between advocacy and the commission&#39;s nonpartisan work on behalf of all Coloradans. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have strong analytical skills. I worked for 15 years as a transportation planner. I developed travel demand models, multimodal transportation studies and transit equity studies. I am comfortable with data and maps. I am a big picture and small detail person. I have a recent example. I recognized a big picture need to better understand social impacts from cumulative transit projects. I developed a methodology specific to a transit agency and provided an equity study of the cumulative impacts of multiple rail and bus service changes. It was a big picture and data driven improvement over an isolated analysis of each individual change. I have another personal example. When our children were young, they would come to us and ask for things. Our response was often &quot;make your case.&quot; I enjoy learning from other people&#39;s logic and reason when they make their case. I am not afraid to explain my logic and reason. However, I also believe logic and reason are only part of a successful outcome. We also learn a lot from our human stories and experiences. I hope that when people see the final product, they say &quot;this makes sense.&quot;
