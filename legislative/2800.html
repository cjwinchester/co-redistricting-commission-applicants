<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  For 39 years, starting in 1974, I practiced labor and employment law and then (for the last 30 years) bankruptcy law at the Denver firm now known as Sherman and Howard, LLC.  I took a leave of absence starting in 2013 with the US Peace Corps, living for 2 years in a remote village in Swaziland (now eSwatinin) in southern Africa, mostly teaching “life skills” to combat the spread of HIV and tutoring and mentoring children in a nearby refugee camp.  We returned to Denver in 2015 but I never returned to work and resigned in 2017.  So I have been effectively retired since 2013.
</p>

  BA Yale University 1970
LLB Georgetown University Law Center 1974
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
2008 and 2012:  I did door knocking for President Obama’s campaigns.  I can’t recall my donations.
2016:  I worked on and donated to Secretary Clinton’s presidential campaign.
2018:  I campaigned extensively (maybe 500 to 600 doors) for successful Colorado Senate candidate Tammy Story.  I donated to her campaign and also to the US Congressional campaign of Jason Crowe.
2020:  I registered voters and encouraged voting participation at mobile free food banks starting in June, 2020.  I donated to Colorado State Senator Rachel Zenzinger’s successful re-election campaign.  I also donated to State Senator Chris Hansen’s campaign and Denver DA Beth McCann’s campaign.  I donated to Andrew Romanoff’s US Senate primary campaign.

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Crestmoor Community Association (a swim and tennis club)
Denver Athletic Club
Colorado Friends of Democracy (an Indivisible group)
Coordinator, informal group discussing Foreign Policy Association topics

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
At the mobile free food pantries starting in June of this year I met briefly many people – mostly Latinx, but not all – who were experiencing difficulties and many were also very interested in voting.
In southern Africa with the Peace Corps my wife and I organized study groups at the local high school and 2 local primary schools and the nearby refugee camp.
I was head of the bankruptcy group at my law firm for 23 years.
I was on the Board and the Executive Committee and was legal counsel to the Denver Symphony from 1985 to 1988.  
I was on the board of Crestmoor Community Association from 2000 to 2002.
In 2009 and 2010 I participated in trail preservation work for the Colorado 14ers Initiative.
For the past 3 years I have been in groups that discussed the 8 annual topics in the Foreign Policy Association&#39;s Great Decisions annual book.  In 2020 I formed a group of my friends; we met (starting in March we met virtually) to discuss each of the topics, and then met a few more time to discuss topics we chose of contemporary interest.
I was on the Board and the Executive Committee of the Colorado Children&#39;s Chorale in the 1990s.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I love this State – its beauty and its people.  I have travelled all over it, from East to West and North to South, vacationing, visiting clients, and trying some cases.  I have climbed all the 14ers.  I love learning the history, geography and culture of each niche and corner in it.  I want to see it well governed, and sensible re-districting is an important contribution to that.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I think I am a good listener, particularly in an area such as re-districting to which I bring little prior knowledge.  I like people and I like getting to know people who have different backgrounds than mine.  As a bankruptcy lawyer we had to negotiate with secured creditors, creditors&#39; committees, trustees, and many other interest-holders, and invariably our negotiated solutions brought more benefits for lower cost than the limited legal solutions available to a judge.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
When I practiced bankruptcy law the legal analysis determined less than 20% of an effective outcome most of the time; the important parts of a solution arose from following and adapting the customs and reality of the industry. 
 Every few years I had to learn a new industry: dry land and irrigated farming; livestock raising and feed lots; vacation real estate; ethanol; oil and gas; hotels; office buildings; hard and soft rock mining; water.  And from the very start, accounting and appraisal.  I think I am pretty good at diving into a new subject and coming up with a working knowledge.
In Swaziland my wife and I tried to learn the local language, siSwati, one of the Bantu family of languages.  We also had to learn the hierarchies of the local school systems, the local chiefdom, refugee camp administration, and some of the local churches in our small, tightly-knit community.  Truthfully, I never acquired a working skill at siSwati, and we were still learning local customs and expectations when we left after our 2-year term ended; I hope re-districting is more readily mastered.  It seems there is a skilled staff who are determined to make this work.
