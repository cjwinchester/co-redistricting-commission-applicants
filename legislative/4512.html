<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I&#39;m a volunteer for the Women&#39;s Homelessness Initiative on the overnight shift sitting with and speaking with 20 guests who stay in our church basement at the Park Hill Congregational United Church of Christ (before COVID shutdowns). Since March 2020, I have collected and delivered clothing, dry goods, water and food to the St. Francis Center, The Gathering Place, and agency affiliates serving homeless women and men and their families. In 2018, I was part of our church effort in a community carnival and raised more than $10K to supply our church efforts in the WHI program. I have been the media relations lead for the Womxn&#39;s March Denver in 2018, 2019, and 2020 event/program years training board member spokespeople, strategizing editorial outreach, and leading media relations for event announcements and outreach initiatives, and on the marketing team in collaboration with social media and related communications outreach. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
It is increasingly concerning that our citizenry has less and less trust in their right to vote and the results of the process. Because I&#39;m a good communicator and love my community, I want to be involved, protect our civil rights and citizens rights, and to the best of my ability, use grass roots communication to assure friends, family, and community that our voting process, rights, and districting is fair. Finally, I grew up with war stories at the dinner table. My German grandparents visited for months at a time; I&#39;m bilingual since learning to speak and both parents were fluent in German (my father a German American farm boy from Stearns County MN). They lived through 2 world wars; my mother&#39;s visceral experiences in WW2, remembering Krystallnacht as a child, running to bomb shelters, getting strafed while riding a bicycle, living with strangers after bomb evacuation, standing in long lines for food after the Allies arrived...so many stories, and many of them witnessing violence or escaping it. I see what is evolving in our country today with great alarm. I am compelled to protect and fight for what is precious. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
After several years of involvement in the Womxn&#39;s March Denver, much reading and numerous courses in anti-racial issues, I&#39;ve built on this work as well as other community and cultural outreach knowledge to understand many points of view. I served on the board of The Spirituals Project from 2006 to 2009 and learned much more about the history of our country, and since then, voting rights. I also see many points of view about disenfranchisement by Americans of all backgrounds. More often than not, we all wish for the same outcome: a safe community, civility, access to opportunity and education, and good relations with our neighbors. Most of us are also interested in another person&#39;s story, and a sense of pride about how many of us from many backgrounds have built the United States of America into a unique and wonderful place to live. Bridging those dreams with everyday reality is the mission of my work on this commission so people can feel connected again to their country and to one another. My own mother was an immigrant from Germany and lived through Nazi Germany from age 9 to 16. She was eager to find a safe and welcoming place to live, and our home was filled with accents and food from many countries, and the fascinating stories of immigration. Considering so many backgrounds, hard work, challenges, and methods to connect people to solve problems is a high priority. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a student of history both personal and reading much throughout the years, also too as a liberal arts student who has studied philosophy and history, I wish to apply a methodical approach to consider as many factors in a situation as well as socio-economic overlays. There are many angles to problems and issues, and it&#39;s important to build a collaborative approach with other commission members. Building consent is most often possible; consensus is quite often impossible, but members can agree knowing the importance of mission and the opportunity for all voices to be heard and considered.
