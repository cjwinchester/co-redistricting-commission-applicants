        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Brandie Balken</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Brandie Balken
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Executive Director for Freedom for All Americans and Freedom for All Americans Education Fund.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a BS in Botany and Chemistry.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80221
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My political activity since November 10, 2015 has been issue specific policy advocacy, as opposed to party or candidate focus. I do not believe I have made any campaign donations in this time, but If I have, it would have been for female candidates of color running for office in other states, likely Deb Haaland. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have been engaged at the local, state and national level in volunteer service. Please see below:
Funders for LGBTQ Issues – Director, Vice Chair of the Board. 2015 – 2018
Denver Botanic Gardens – Member – 2016 - current
One Colorado – Director, Treasurer – 2018 – current
Dry Creek Trail clean up – Volunteer – 2018, 2019
Growing Home Food Pantry – Volunteer – current
Period Kits – Volunteer – current

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have provided leadership on several boards, both local and national, outside of my profession. Additionally, a good portion of my career has been focused on advocacy. Initially, my advocacy was focused on environmental change -  specifically for Indigenous communities in the American West. After coming out, my advocacy shifted to LGBTQ issues, with a focus on basic non-discrimination protections. Additionally, I have written letters, made donations and attended rallies in support of paid sick time off for workers, criminal justice reform, and basic services for people experiencing homelessness. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I take the opportunity to serve on this commission seriously. I have spent the last 20 years working towards consensus-based solutions to community issues across ideological divides. I believe that the skills I have gained and the perspective I have to offer could be an asset on the commission in navigating both the data and deeply held views. Representation, and consideration of a diverse set of perspectives and interests will be critical to the success of this undertaking. I believe that fairly drawn maps are essential to our democracy, and should be informed by comprehensive data sets, honest dialogue and thoughtful compromise. I would be honored to participate in such an important task that will impact the Coloradans for the next decade.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe the skills I have gained from my professional work could be useful to the commission. I have been in countless situations in which there are profound differences in perspective and have managed to facilitate and frame a conversation that focuses on areas of resonance to build empathy and understanding. One example of this was a meeting I facilitated in 2013 between activists from the progressive LGBTQ group “Soul Force” and senior members from the public affairs office of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Several members of Soul Force had grown up in the LDS church and had undergone conversion therapy. They were threatening to “lock down” the entrances to Temple Square to call attention to the practice. As the executive director of the state LGBTQ equality organization, I was asked to broker a meeting between the parties to see if there was an option to address this issue without a confrontation. It was tantamount that the meeting be respectful as well as honest, so I constructed a format that allowed each person a chance to speak and gave others an opportunity to respond / reflect. The meeting lasted roughly 90 minutes, with all participants hearing a perspective different from their own. At the end, there was no longer talk of lock down. Instead there was an opening to talk about how families can support their LGBTQ children within their doctrine, but without causing long term psychological harm. 
I believe my familial background has also contributed to my ability to see another person’s humanity, and to treat people equitably. In short, I was raised by my extended family bouncing between a trailer park in a coal town, and an old butcher shop in an agricultural valley. My sister was the first person in my family to attend college and get a degree, and I became the second some 4 years later. My family includes people recently (and not so recently) immigrated from Japan, Mexico, Iran and Brazil. I have had the remarkable opportunity to work on as an advocate for the environment, for LGBTQ people, for people experiencing homelessness and food insecurity, for the squeezed middle class and for women – all with partners in the faith community, the business community and with folks on both sides of the aisle. I have worked as a department lead for a small local business, a program officer for a private foundation, an executive director for both a small state based non-profit and a national nonprofit, and as a deputy director for a multi-state policy initiative – each of these positions has required me to bring very different people together to create a shared path forward, without prioritizing or privileging any one person’s opinion. Experience has taught me that we get our best results when stakeholders come together to create solutions through consensus focused conversations. 

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I received my degree in Botany and Chemistry which cemented my linear thinking skills. I am trained to identify the goal or the problem, assess all data relevant to the problem, and work with others to create a path that aligns the data with the needs of stakeholders.
In the course of my career, I have been responsible for drafting and managing budgets; ideating, vetting and creating and project managing programmatic plans; facilitating brainstorms, community conversations, and board meetings; creating and overseeing demographic, persuasion and messaging research programs as well as assessing those data sets, providing interpretation and presenting results. Each of these tasks required strong engagement, collaboration and communication skills. 

I believe I have the skill set to contribute to the commission, and deeply appreciate your consideration.
