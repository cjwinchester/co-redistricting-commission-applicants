        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Anne L Lindsey</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Anne L Lindsey
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Retired
2010 &amp; 2011 worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at the University of Colorado-Denver
Prior to moving to Colorado in 2001, Associate Partner/Management Consultant, Accenture
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  AB-Mount Holyoke College, MBA-Harvard Business School, MArch-University of Colorado Denver, MUD-University of Colorado Denver, CPA-State of Illinois
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80303
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I volunteered for both Barack Obama campaigns and served as a Volunteer Captain for the Democratic National Convention in 2008. Donations in last five years to: Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, John Hickenlooper, Wayne New (Denver City Council) and a variety of campaigns for $50 or less via ActBlue
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Golden Triangle Creative District-Board member and Chair of Urban Design Committee, Denver Moves:Downtown, Civic Center Transit District Stakeholder Committee, Inter-Neighborhood Cooperation-Transportation Committee and Zoning &amp; Development Committees, McNichols Public Art Review Committee (Note-no longer actively part of these committees given my recent move from Denver to Boulder). 
League of Women Voters-Boulder
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
While studying for my degree in Urban Design, I sought out opportunities to ensure new buildings, transportation, and public right-of-way projects considered the needs of all users including residents, business owners and property owners. During my 13 years as Chair of the Golden Triangle Urban Design Committee, working with city staff, we successfully saw a Neighborhood Plan adopted in 2014 and a rezoning project begun. Comments by property owners and architects that brought numerous buildings to the committee for review, indicated they felt projects were improved by the suggestions and questions. It was never an adversarial process.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Fair and balanced districts are important to ensure each person in Colorado feels represented and heard in our Legislature. I love maps and worked with the ArcGIS software while studying for my Urban Design degree. I taught the use of census data as a teaching assistant and it is amazing what you can discern from the data (e.g. lots of vacant housing-perhaps a number of second homes?).
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a management consultant, I found listening to each person to identify what was most important to them and then suggesting solutions that attempted to meet the most critical needs, rather than trying to solve each person&#39;s total list of wants (or the noisiest person&#39;s list) was important in reaching agreement. Some people were reluctant to say things that might be controversial, but it was important to understand and address these underlying concerns. My most successful projects were when everyone thought the solutions were their own ideas. 
I&#39;ve been a Republican, now I am a Democrat, and I&#39;ve voted for people of both parties. I&#39;ve always believed in listening to all sides and resolving differences. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a Management Consultant, I was frequently in unfamiliar situations, listening to problems as described by a variety of people (everyone of course had their own view). My job was to take these views, help craft a solution and get everyone to agree it was the best answer. Often my company was then selected to help implement the solution.
During my time as an auditor, I was known as someone who could understand complicated financial data, sort out whether there was fraud, and then explain the issue(s) simply to those without a financial background.
