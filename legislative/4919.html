<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
For 20 years, I have advocated for the Latinx community, underserved communities and communities of color, children and those with much potential, but without social capital. I have done this work in my neighborhood, in school settings, through my work and community service. The communities I advocate for are often spoken about in terms of their deficits and I have always been a strong advocate to help them tell their own stories about their contributions and potential. It has often been lonely and exhausting as well as exhilarating and rewarding.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I see this as a powerful opportunity to continue to do the work I mentioned in the previous question, advocating for those without the privilege and social capital that I have. Also, at this point in my life and career, I pick and choose how I spend my community service time very carefully. I want to be at tables where I can make a real difference. Redistricting provides the opportunity to advocate for power for communities that haven&#39;t had it, and the opportunity for compromise with everyone. After this election, I am so proud of Colorado&#39;s political engagement and I believe that serving on a redistricting commission allows me to pay back Colorado and my fellow Coloradans for the statement that our turnout made.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Fair and impartial:  I have served on, I believe, three juries since I have lived in Denver (since 1991), one federal and two in Denver County Court. You don&#39;t make it through voir dire if you are not deemed to be able to be fair and impartial. 

As a Latina who worked in a corporate environment for more than 20 years, I have had to make a lot of compromises, as a person of color and a woman, the same. I spent five or six years representing a big bad public utility in neighborhoods all over the region and I was very successful at turning around groups of angry residents and ratepayers. The most fun part of that job was when our back was against the wall and everyone expected to hate us in a public meeting and then hearing the neighbors walk out of the meeting say, &quot;wow, I am surprised they are so nice!&quot;   That was never about what happened at that meeting. It was about long, slow painstaking trust building beforehand. I am willing to put in this kind of work.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My Emergenetics profile is predomintantly BLUE and YELLOW, which means I have extreme conceptual and analytical skills. Emergenetics profiling defines the analytical thinking preference as:  clear thinker, logical problem solver, data driven, rational, learns by mental analysis. The conceptual thinking preference is defined as:  imaginative, intuitive about ideas, visionary. And finally on the Emergenetics Behavioral Scale my score is 52 on the FLEXIBILITY scale. So, I believe the combination of my analytical approach, with the ability to solve problems creatively and to be flexible is a near-perfect mix for this job. 

In addition, over the past 4.75 years in my current job, I have taken an organization that had never heard of business analysis and turned it into a business with a social mission. It&#39;s taken analytics, clear thinking, and logical problem solving.
