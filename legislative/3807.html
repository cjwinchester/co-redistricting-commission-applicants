        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Randall Allan Fullington</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Randall Allan Fullington
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently the Director of Program Development for the Provost&#39;s Office for Academic Innovation at the University of Colorado Boulder.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I earned my Bachelor of Arts in English Literature from the University of Denver in 1998. I earned my Master of Arts in English Literature at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2006. I earned my PhD in English Literature from the University of Colorado Boulder in 2016.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80207
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
For the 2020 election, I donated small sums to the Biden campaign through ActBlue. The first donation was for $25 and the second for $15. To the best of my recollection, I do not think I donated sums to other campaigns or political organizations before this summer and fall. If I did, they were in the amount of $10 to $25 and one-off contributions.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I attend Denver Community Church (DCC) and serve on the Missions Team. Prior to that, I served on the Social Justice Team at DCC. I also volunteered with DCC in 2015-2017 to renovate their uptown location and served on their safety team.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a member of the DCC Missions Team, I work with a team to provide funding for global and local missions organizations. The majority of the work focuses on local mission organizations, such as Dry Bones Denver, Bus Stop Ministries, Joshua Station, Khesed, Hope Kids, and Extreme Community Makeover, to name a few. Many of these organizations provide support and services to people experiencing homelessness, minors who have no place to live, and others who do not have the money or resources to support themselves. Other organizations we support provide counseling to people who cannot afford it or social events to families who have kids dealing with terminal illness. Extreme Community Makeover, an organization I also used to partner with directly, works to unite neighborhoods in Denver by organizing and supporting clean-up and renovation projects in neighborhoods across the metro area. Early last spring, the Missions Team began working with a COVID support fund to help people who are out of work or who need financial assistance during the pandemic.

As a member of the Missions board, it is my responsibility to hear from our partners, to build and maintain relationships with them, and to consider their financial requests in a thoughtful manner. I work with a dedicated team that has a limited budget and needs to distribute funds—both on recurring and a one-time basis—to partners who work hard to support members of our community who need help due to financial loss, medical issues, or social stigmas.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
First and foremost, I believe that redistricting should be a fair and bipartisan effort so that all citizens in Colorado have a voice in electing their officials, both at the state and federal levels of government. I believe that our country and our state work best when all voting residents can participate in the election process. Second, I want to give back to the state that has helped me grow into the person I am today. I have camped all over Colorado, hiked the Colorado Trail from Denver to Durango, snowboarded as many resorts and backcountry trails I could, ascended over 20 fourteeners, and climbed, fished, and mountain biked throughout the Colorado Rockies. Throughout my adventures, I have met people from all walks of life and from a diversity of political opinions. We may have differences, but we all live in a state—and are often shaped by a state—that presents so many opportunities for recreation, conversation, and life-building activities. Third, I am the father of two kids, one of whom is 5 and the other 2. I want them to grow up in a state that will one day give them an equitable voice in the political process. My commitment to them is to raise them to think critically, to participate in Colorado’s outdoor activities, and to be active members of their civic community. I believe this will best happen if we have a fair voting process for all Coloradans because my kids’ future is tied directly to the future of the state.

<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As the Director of Program Development at the University of Colorado Boulder, I work to bring consensus among a variety of stakeholders every day. My current responsibilities include implementing a new online graduate degree in data science. This degree is truly revolutionary in that it forgoes traditional admissions and lets anyone who is interested in the degree demonstrate their proficiency in order to gain admittance to the degree. This is a radical concept that upends the traditional path to graduate education and opens it to anyone with the skills to earn the degree. It is my job to recruit faculty, staff, and administrators to embrace this vision and build a successful program. I began this process by listening to the views of all stakeholders, which are frequently at odds with each other. At a University as big as CU Boulder, faculty, staff, and administrators all have their own beliefs as to what is important, what is possible, and what needs to get done at the University. Building a coalition goes beyond listening, though. I also invite these stakeholders to share their differences and opinions with each other. I know that the program will not launch successfully unless everyone can freely and safely work through their concerns. Finally, I facilitate conversations that lead to collaboration and consensus. The University of Colorado Boulder is a diverse community, and the members of that community express sometimes conflicting priorities and visions for higher education. Rather than seeing these differences as a roadblock, I see them as vital to building a well designed educational experience that meets the needs of the students, the faculty, and the staff at CU Boulder. If we didn&#39;t build from and respect these contrasting opinions, we could not build a program that needs to be thoroughly vetted from a variety of expert viewpoints.

I will take this same approach to promoting consensus among the commissioners. I will listen to their unique concerns, invite all stakeholders to share opinions and ideas with the other commissioners, and then facilitate solutions. We cannot create a more equitable voting experience unless we hear from and respond to the diverse opinions of Coloradans from across the state and in all walks of life. I don’t see our lived and political differences as a liability to the process of redistricting; rather, I see it as an essential ingredient for creating a thoughtful and healthy decision-making process.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I would not have been able to earn a PhD in English Literature without applying analysis, logic, and reason to a host of scholarly challenges. The core argument of my dissertation analyzed the way American writers use language and stories to create change in the real world. In order to prove this argument, I had to analyze over one hundred works of fiction and as many works of critical non-fiction. I analyzed the ways authors represented current events, built compelling characters, and told engaging stories by examining their fiction from multiple perspectives. I often analyzed the words, phrases, and structures of stories in order to discover and highlight the way individual authors used language to produce emotional responses. I analyzed the myriad ways authors pulled from philosophy, politics, economics, and social structures both to tell a convincing story and to elicit a desire for change. I also read and responded to popular and academic critics in order to situate fictional works within the larger conversation of our cultural milieu. For example, I analyzed the ways the television show The Wire depicted economic hardship, addiction, policing, educational shortcomings, and government responses to make the case that The Wire asks its readers to consider the entire spectrum of lived experience before casting judgment on any one character in the show. I then identified approaches to addressing the cycle of poverty suggested by the show, even as those solutions were often hard to see in the series&#39; documentary-style approach to recording what, on first glance, seems irredeemable.

Beyond the actual process of analyzing fiction, I needed to problem-solve and strategize throughout the dissertation writing experience. As an independent researcher, I needed to search out, understand, and synthesize multiple perspectives. If I found that I was headed down a dead-end, I would stop my line of inquiry and begin again: researching new subjects, finding new critics, and learning new ways of thinking about how fiction works in the world. Though I had valuable guidance from my advisor, I engaged in research on my own. I believe this experience gave me two of the most useful skills I possess today in my work at CU Boulder: to engage in independent research and to recognize when something is not working and make the necessary adjustments. Being open to and knowing how to pivot is key to working through difficult concepts and challenging problems.
