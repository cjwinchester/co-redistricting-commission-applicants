</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated small amounts of money to campaigns.  I donated to WisDems this year.  I donated to Phil Weiser&#39;s campaign for Attorney General in 2018 and I was a volunteer on his campaign that year as well.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am a member of Toastmasters International, I am currently a member of the Colorado  Association, the American Bar Association, the Colorado Women&#39;s Bar Association (CWBA), the Alliance of Professional Women (APW), and Women in Technology.  I am on the CWBA Public Policy Committee, and the CWBA Convention Committee. I am chair of the Public Affairs Committee of the APW and I am a member of the APW Outreach Committee.  I was recently elected chair of the Ombudsman Committee of the Referees Commission for US Fencing.  I am a founding Board Member of WFencing, an organization for women professionals (coaches, referees, club owners) in the sport of fencing.  Previously (but since 2015) I was an elected member of the collaborative school committee (CSC) for Denver School of the Arts.

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As chair of the APW Public Affairs Committee I find speakers to inform on various important issues such as homelessness, mental health, drug abuse, ballot issues, and other similar items.  The APW Outreach Committee, supports various organizations and causes that support women and children.  Some of these organizations include the Delores Project, CASA, Arapahoe House, Kenzi&#39;s Causes, Girls on the Run and Hope House.  We also raise money to provide scholarships for non-traditional female students in Colorado attempting to finish their college education.  As a member of the CWBA Public Policy Committee, we have supported Colorado bills like the Equal Pay Act and Family Leave Act.  We also evaluate Amicus briefs in cases either in the Colorado appellate courts or the Supreme Court that impact women or children and assist the CWBA Board in deciding whether or not to sign on to these briefs.  WFencing deals with issues that concern Women professionals in fencing nationwide, including those of us in Colorado.  The Ombudsman Committee exists to provide an outlet for fencing referees across the country (including those in Colorado) to discuss issues of discrimination, bullying, and other problems concerning referees and we provide advice to assist those with concerns in obtaining resolution.  The CSC is an organization in place in Denver Public Schools  where parents, teachers, and staff of the school collaborate to address issues concerning the school.  We evaluate and assist with the budget, we evaluate the principal, and at DSA, we also discussed issues of diversity and inclusivity and tried to find ways to address concerns about how to attract a more diverse population, how to support students with various needs, including financial needs, and how to fulfill the goals of the school with regard to both the arts and academics.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that the districting process as it previously existed was broken.  I believe that fair districts are important for having fair elections where all voices are represented.  I am eager to work with others who have different points of view in what I hope will be a civilized, well thought out discourse about how to create districts that will be fair and equitable and properly represent the population of our state.  I know that this process can be contentious.  I believe that I am good at defusing combustible situations (as a fencing referee, I see them all the time).  I am a good listener and believe that I can see many sides of an issue, things are rarely black and white to me.  I have worked to facilitate agreement in other situations and I believe that I am good at facilitation.  I believe that good listening skills and the ability to work towards agreement are going to be important for commission members to be able to work together to achieve the goal of fair districting.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As an ombudsman, fair and impartial is the main requirement to do the job well.  My careers as a transactional attorney and as a contracts manager have required me to understand both sides of an argument and come up with a solution that works for both the client I am drafting for and the other side who has to accept what has been drafted.  The sales people often want to give away the farm in order to get the sale and in those cases, I need to protect the company while still helping the sales people get the sale.  As a fencing referee, I have to be impartial, even when I know one of the fencers or their coach has been disrespectful to me in the past.  I believe that I succeed and that I have a reputation as being fair and impartial.  If that were not the case, I would not hold the position I do as a high level referee at the national level.  I am proud of the fact that in the past ten years I have not had to give out a single black card because I have defused situations with coaches, fencers, and spectators before they erupted into something that would require a black card.  Finally, when it comes to the commission, I am of the belief that no one can get everything they want.  The goal is to come as close to a win win as you can.  That requires patience (of which an IT person has to have plenty), the ability to see all sides (which a good lawyer should be able to do), the ability to listen well (not always a skill that lawyers have - but one I believe I have), and the ability to communicate well.  

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have always believed that what made me a good lawyer and a good IT person were the same things.  Both require an analysis of the problem or issue, research to see how others have resolved or decided such issues, and then determining the appropriate course of action based on what the facts and the research have shown you.  Sometimes you think a particular path will be the correct one and you find that the path actually doesn&#39;t lead where you thought it would.  So, you do a little more research and you take a different tack until you find the solution that works.
