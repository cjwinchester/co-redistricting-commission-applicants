<h3>Background</h3>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have been a participant in many days of action at the Capitol for; gun and school safety, environmental causes and education.  I have volunteered on several campaigns; canvassing, speaking at events, giving public comment, sign coordinator, lit drop off, voter registration, texting or anything that needs to be done.  This year we had to be more creative and I hired a marching band to, socially distance, march through the streets of Denver, farmers markets and parks giving out voter registration information.  I also worked with local street artists, musicians, dancers  and performers to promote voting this year while also supporting diverse community artists and businesses who are most impacted by covid. In the 2018 election, I spoke to over 1,000 people about the importance of voting and providing information mostly going door to door in primarily Spanish speaking communities. I&#39;m passionate about voting, access, equity and democracy!
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have worked in a variety of industries; manufacturing, service, oil &amp; gas, real estate development and I&#39;m a small business owner.  I have seen all sides of the challenges and potentials for many facets of businesses, their employees and the Colorado communities they impact.  I&#39;m also a mom who is looking out for the future of my children and all the children.  I have lived in Colorado Springs, Denver and the Gunnison Valley. I understand what makes each place and the people who live there unique.  In some ways we are different and have different needs and in many ways we are the same and have the same needs.  I&#39;m very outgoing, I love talking with a variety of people to gain a better understanding of the world.  People have a tendency to be open with me.  Now more than ever, we need to come together, unite and work towards a fair future for all. I&#39;m passionate about unity and democracy.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have spent my career working with people with different views.  What I have learned is that there is a lot of middle ground to be found.  I&#39;m not afraid to have the hard conversations while also bringing grace to the situation.  I have called almost every state representative regarding gun/school safety.  These are not easy conversations to be had but we need to have these conversations because there are a lot of common sense things that can be done when we work together to find common ground.   I have worked well with a variety of people, from the executives of O&amp;G companies, to truck drivers, factory workers, ranchers, farmers, moms, hunters, teachers, kids, the unhoused and so one treating everyone with respect and also listening to the different voices.    Our communities, our state and  our country need us to find the things that unite us. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I&#39;m an accountant and am analytical.  I understand numbers and I know how to look at something and ask, &quot;Does this make sense?&quot; also &quot;Is this far?&quot; and &quot; What are the unintended consequences?&quot;.   I have experience with several start ups and have also planed several events.  I have logistical, creative and problem solving experience from working in oil and gas particularly on large scale crude by rail projects overseeing and accounting for $millions in product.  I have spent a lot of time looking at maps, pipelines and rail road systems working on transportation strategies.  I&#39;m good at being creative, mindful and looking at things on a micro and macro level.
