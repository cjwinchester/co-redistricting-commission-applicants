<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>

</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Valerie Leal-Whitehead, Valerie Ann Leal-Whitehead</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>

</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Banner Health, Cardiovascular Institute, 20 years. During my tenure here I have written our policy and procedures, helped to set up our stress testing services, served as supervisor responsible for hiring/terminating/evaluating staff, and I currently provide phone nurse triage , walk in patient care and other miscellaneous tasks. Prior to my current position: NCMC [Banner Health], Telemetry nurse 1981-85, Cardiac Rehab/patient education 1985-1998; Cardiac Research nurse 1998-2000 with the Heart and Vascular cardiology group [now affiliated with UC Health]. I also substitute taught at UNC [University of Northern Colorado here in Greeley] in the kinesiology department in the late 1980s, during a time they were in a bind with professors. I taught electrocardiography and stress testing for two separate quarters. Over the course of my career I have been provided with many opportunities to present/teach in a variety of settings and teaching is something I enjoy a great deal. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  University of Northern Colorado, School of Nursing, BSN 1981
RN license, State of Colorado
Certified Exercise Technologist, ACSM [American College of Sports Medicine], 1986
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>

  80634
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I volunteer in the phone bank and to walk neighborhoods during presidential election years, with the exception of this year.  I donate to the Democrats national organization during presidential election years, generally no more than $200 per election cycle.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
During the last five years my volunteer activity has been primarily associated with my church.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I served three terms on our local board of education, 1993 - 2003. I had an unsuccessful run for the board of education in 2010.  I volunteered in many ways with the theatre/performing arts and athletics at our children&#39;s high school during their time at the school. We hosted exchange students 3 years while our children were in high school and college. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
With the exception of the unsuccessful run for the school board in 2010, I have not served nor sought to serve my community in some time.  I have done a great deal of volunteer service through my church, including teaching children, teaching adults, serving as youth leader, camp director and the various philanthropic activities that go with serving youth.  I was at a Women&#39;s March recently, during which I learned of the commission and I decided to apply.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I ran for our local board of education during a contentious time in our community [contention re: public education and what/how children should learn], and I was able to forge great relationships with board members whose backgrounds and beliefs were very different from my own.  In my work setting I have served as mentor to others, and it is not unusual for me to be approached to help resolve differences among others. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a nurse, I am called upon daily to address a myriad of issues quickly and with clarity.  I am a very good listener and I am able to hone in on a patient or colleagues question/concern, and problem solve with them.
