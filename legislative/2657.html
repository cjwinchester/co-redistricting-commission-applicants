<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am delighted and honored to submit my interest for consideration for the Colorado Independent Redistricting Commission. 

My resume highlights a proven track record of facilitative and innovative leadership, with a focus on community partnerships and responsiveness. I have demonstrated effective leadership at both the local and national levels by utilizing inclusive strategy development and program implementation. 
With nearly two decades of relationships in the philanthropic and nonprofit sectors, locally and nationally, I bring multi-faceted experience and robust networks to my  work and volunteer activities.  My professional and community experience reflects my deep commitment to the principles of respect, reciprocity, equity, and partnership.  I strive to navigate and negotiate team work with grace and humility.

I have had the opportunity to hold a diverse array of leadership roles in the philanthropic sector.  I have developed skills for addressing issues of access, opportunity, and equity: community engagement, partnership development, cultural brokering, and inclusive leadership. 

Locally, I served as the  Program Director at Community Foundation Boulder County from 2004-2009.  Within three years, I developed and launched the Expanding Leadership Initiative (ELI) with the support of the full organization and Board of Trustees. The components of ELI included an intern and nonprofit mentorship program, funding for nonprofits to prioritize and embed inclusive efforts, and the early framework for the Leadership Fellows program. These programs still impact Boulder County today, and I am truly honored to have held a role in the early equity efforts of Community Foundation Boulder County. 

In my most recent leadership role as the National Director of CHANGE Philanthropy, I have enjoyed the privilege and challenge of rebranding and expanding a national philanthropic coalition. CHANGE Philanthropy is about transforming philanthropy from within by building knowledge, fostering diversity, and creating connections. In five years, we have served as a catalyst igniting the philanthropic sector to advance philanthropic equity by engaging over twenty philanthropic serving organizations in their equity journeys. I have also been the coordinating force in the planning of the 2017 and 2019 Unity Summits, which are co-designed with all ten CHANGE Partner organizations as well as local funders and regional associations. I am adept at integrating the input of multiple stakeholders for collective decision-making. 

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have nearly 20 years of grantmaking experience, evaluating proposals and budgets, on local, regional, and national scale. I have sat in the facilitator and the reviewer roles that have required logic and problem-solving skills to make tough decisions on resource distribution.
