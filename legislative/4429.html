<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I ran for Denver City Council in District 1 in the spring of 2019. I donate to the Colorado Public Interest Research Group monthly, and I donated $200 to the Biden presidential campaign. I have worked in government communications most of my career, including for Mayor/Governor John Hickenlooper.

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Since I was young, I have always felt compelled to participate in public processes. As a communications professional, I have often felt I was able to give voice to those who were otherwise underrepresented in my community, ensuring everyone had a voice at the table. I pride myself on listening to the interests of others, being balanced and unbiased in my approaches to representation, and able to advocate on behalf of the interests of the whole. My City Council campaign was based on the idea of bringing diverse people together to solve problems collaboratively. I believe my background in journalism and communications, along with more than 20 years of experience in government, enable me to think objectively and ask tough questions that can help bring people together and build consensus around difficult issues. I have done this in community organizations like my children&#39;s school PTAs, as well as a volunteer board member for a charter school serving homeless youth and an LGBTQIA++ advocacy organization. I also believe my roots as a biracial female provide me the ability to bring a cross cultural perspective often missing from the dialogue. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the Colorado Redistricting Commission because I believe it is a fantastic opportunity to give back to my community by helping ensure our state&#39;s districts are fair and balanced, that they represent true communities and not political gerrymandering, and to rebuild public trust in our political systems. I believe my education in communications, journalism and political science, as well as my lifelong participation as an unaffiliated voter (often underrepresented in Colorado) make me an ideal candidate.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am a strong listener, able to ask questions for clarity and find opportunities to bring people together. I have often promoted consensus on the many boards I have served on, bringing people from very different backgrounds together around difficult issues. I also am able to utilize my understanding of the political process, how government works, my own campaign experience, and my journalistic training to be fair and impartial, and to help others approach the process objectively and with a spirit of collaboration. I have taken multiple leadership classes, including participation in Leadership Denver, building my skills in helping others work together toward a common goal. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My training as a journalist and communications professional has taught me to ask tough questions, ensure I understand, analyze processes and systems, look for missing perspectives, and ultimately be able to explain complex concepts in simple terms to ensure understanding. I typically start by conducting thorough research, looking for the context and history of a situation to understand how it evolved to what it is today. I seek to understand what is working, what isn&#39;t and why. And then I look for options about how to improve and build processes and systems to do so.
