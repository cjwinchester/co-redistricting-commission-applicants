</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Serving as the Fruita Municipal Court Judge, 2000-2016.  As a judicial officer, I was prohibited from actively participating in any political organizations.  Currently I am not participating in any political organizations or campaigns.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Currently, I serve on the Board of Trustees for Family Health West in Fruita. The board oversees the operations of 2 senior living centers and Colorado Canyons Hospital all located in Fruita.  I have participated and served in several different local organizations  involving youth sports.  Most recently served for 8 years on the Grand Valley Youth Lacrosse Board which developed and established youth lacrosse as an activity for Mesa County youth.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
On a daily bases as a practicing attorney, primarily in the areas of family and criminal law, I am required to represent, advocate for individuals and try to develop when possible a reasonable resolution to the client&#39;s various issues.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As a youth growing up in Durango I was very actively involved in the local and state wide political activities.  Both of my parents have served as members of the Durango City Council. My parents have been very actively involved in the Democratic party in Southwest Colorado. My parents have demonstrated to me the importance of being actively involved in our political system. During the last 30 years, my career has greatly limited my opportunity to participate.  I have no interest to actively run for a political office but I do want to become part of the political solution. As a youth I participated in numerous campaigns in various capacities 3rd Congressional, US Senate, 7th Senator CO district and 58th CO house district and others. I understand the political diversity of each region of our state. I understand the diversity of people that reside in Colorado and believe I can assist in the process to help Colorado.  The redistricting question is more complicated than where do we draw the line on a map to determine the districts based solely on population factors. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a fifth generation native of western Colorado I have a strong heritage, commitment and understanding of Colorado&#39;s&#39; values and history. To promote consensus requires an open mind and a willingness to listen to other&#39;s ideas. To promote consensus also requires the ability to try to remove the emotion out of a situation and discussion.  The challenge is to develop a consensus when others are not ready whiling and able to listen to each other, consider someone else opinion, and to not become emotional about the issue or discussion.  As a municipal court judge I was required on a regular bases to be fair and or impartial.  I took pride in the fact I could do so regardless of the outer influences that may have existed.  It can be very difficult to be fair and impartial. For example, many years ago I volunteered to do the most thankless job, little league umpire.  I was umpiring my son&#39;s game and was hearing a lot of parents from both teams voicing their displeasure with my calls. As luck would have it, my son was up to bat, 2 outs, 2 runners on base, and I called him out on a no swing strike three.  My son to this day is still &quot;disputing&quot; my called strike three.  But it was the right call.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Analytical skills start with the correct issue identification.  To apply logic and reason to a problem first requires a complete understanding of all the relevant factual information pertaining to the identified issue.  After proper issue identification and collecting all the information the answer to a problem is generally self evident and obvious.
