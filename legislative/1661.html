        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Randy W. Dipner</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Randy W. Dipner
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently retired but provide consulting support to the company I previously owned, Meeting the Challenge. I founded MTC in 1989. The company provides information and support for businesses, individuals, and state and local governments related to federal disability laws. I sold the company in 2018 and have been a consultant since that time.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I graduated from the Ohio State University in June 1972 with dual bachelor’s degrees in aerospace engineering and in computer &amp; information science.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80908
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
The founding and management of my company, Meeting the Challenge, certainly is my greatest example of all these areas. MTC competed for and was awarded a federal contract to operate the Americans with Disabilities Act Information Center for the six-state Rocky Mountain Region in 1991 and continues to operate the Center today. The company grew from a single person to over 20 employees and expanded its operations to organizations across the country. 

I would also point to my organization of the All Colorado Beer Festival as an example of my organizational skills. The ACBF&#39;s 1st festival in November 2013 attracted just under 1,000 patrons and 19 brewers and donated $10,000 to local nonprofits. In 2016 the festival had grown to over 2,600 attendees and 75 brewers. We donated $85,000 that year. Organizing an all-volunteer organization to produce such an event is a challenge on many levels.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I ran for and was elected as precinct chairman in the early 1980s and subsequently ran for and was elected as an elector to the district republican assembly and as an alternate to the state republican convention. 

In 1982 I attended a program oriented to teaching business-people and then encouraging them about running for public office. The program was organized by Steve Schuck. One of my co-students was Gale Norton who went on to hold positions in the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Interior and then Colorado Attorney General. I worked on Steve Schuck’s campaign for Colorado Governor in 1986.

I chaired the unsuccessful primary campaign for district attorney Ed Arcuri in 1984 when he ran against longtime incumbent, Robert Russel. The race was close enough that it triggered a recount which I was required to monitor. Barney Iuppa defeated Russel in the general election.

I provided data analysis for several of Mike Bird’s campaigns for state house and senate in the 1980s.

I have not been active in politics since the 1990s.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I was the chairman of the Struthers Ranch HOA in 2016/17. 

I founded the All Colorado Beer Festival in 2013 and continue as the chairman of the board for the organization. The ACBF is a 501 (c)(3) charitable organization that raises money for local nonprofits by staging beer festivals. The ACBF raised and distributed over $500,000 during its 12 years of active operations. 

I was on the advisory board for the Home Front Cares from 2016 through 2019 and on its case review committee in 2018 and 2019. THFC gives grants to veterans and active duty military who have financial difficulties of many kinds. 

From 1974 through the present I have been a member of Theatreworks in Colorado Springs. I was a long-time board member, a technical director for several productions, and part time development director for the organization. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that the process of creating districts for state legislature and national representatives has long been one that was hidden from public view. Whichever party was in the majority used its position to carve up the state to its own advantage. I believe the process should be open to and performed by the general public, and it&#39;s the reason I voted for the propositions to move the process to the citizens in 2018. It is also the primary reason for my interest in serving on the commission.

The 2020/21 redistricting for Colorado will be more difficult than the past several decennial redistricting efforts. Colorado has seen significant increases in its population since 2000 and the population has migrated within the state as well. Colorado’s increased population makes it highly likely that we will gain a U.S. House of Representatives seat and the allocation of seats in the state house and senate will also be significantly modified. For these reasons I think the redistricting commissions’ actions will be challenging. 

I believe that my analytical and organizational skills developed from my academic background in engineering as well as my real-life experience organizing and managing a company and a nonprofit give me the necessary qualifications to participate. I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s enough to merely shout about why something is a problem. When the opportunity presents itself, it is important to step up and offer your capabilities to improve the situation.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
While I have strong views in politics - I am a registered Republican - my political outlook is more libertarian. I believe this outlook allows me to see the positions of both left and right more objectively. My goal if selected for the commission will be to move the process forward by listening to all comments and positions and to present my view objectively. Most people can come to consensus when provided with facts even when that consensus is not entirely their opinion. Several of my past experiences have helped me develop my consensus-building skills.

I was active in the Association of Computing Machinery starting in 1982. ACM is one of the largest professional computing societies in the world with over 80,000 members. I became the chair of the Special Interest Group (SIG) on computing and disability in 1987 and the chair of the SIG Council of over 50 individual SIGs in 1991. As the chair it was my responsibility to run semi-annual meetings of all the SIG chairs and ensure that all the disparate views and needs of the SIGs were fairly represented. In 1992 I was elected as vice president of the entire ACM organization. My experiences at ACM, while somewhat in the past helped me to understand how to get large groups of very disparate individuals to come to consensus.

From 1994-1999, I sat on two federal advisory committees to establish accessibility standards for electronic and information technology and facilities. I was a member of the U.S. Access Board’s Americans with Disabilities Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) Review Committee which was responsible for a complete assessment and rewrite of the ADAAG. The process took two years and required consensus-building to ensure that the new standards met the needs of the various disability groups while still being feasible for the construction industry. The Committee received the National Performance Review Award from Vice President Gore. I was also a member of the U.S. Access Board’s committee on Accessible Electronic and Information Technology and was on the ANSI A117.1 Working Group on dwelling unit accessibility.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My training is as an engineer. I deal in analysis and logic. I have applied this training in nontraditional areas. Whether it was the founding and operation of a company devoted to disability rights, a beer festival to raise money for nonprofits, or our HOA, I have used my analysis and logic skills from engineering to present data for others to consider and from that data to build consensus for moving forward.
