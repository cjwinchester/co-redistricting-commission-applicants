</p>

</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80919
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I have worked for 20+ years as a strategy consultant, advising private-sector businesses on how products and services can better meet their customers’ needs.  Across hundreds of professional engagements with business leaders, I have been asked to understand consumer populations, interpret multiple sources of qualitative and quantitative data, and clearly communicate recommendations.  As my resume highlights, I am trained statistician and social scientist.  I have also had roles in managing a statistical software start-up and as a college-level economics lecturer.  
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
This is my first year of any notable political activity, and I have never run for or held any elected office.  In 2020, I served as a precinct organizer for the El Paso County Democratic party.  For the November 2020 General Election, I volunteered as a poll watcher for the Colorado Democrats, and I was hired as temporary Election Judge by El Paso County.  During the summer and fall of 2020, I have volunteered my time campaigning for several women candidates in federal and state-level offices.  Year to date for 2020, I have contributed about $375 in total across the following groups/candidates:  El Paso County Democratic Party, Meg Fossinger, Jillian Freeland, and Diane Mitsch Bush.  I do not believe that I’ve made any financial contributions from 2015-2019.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Multiple years as a PTO Board Member, School Accountability Committee, and Parent Sounding Board Representative for an Academy District 20 Elementary School; El Paso County Democratic Party member. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am 10-year resident of Colorado, and my experience living and voting in our great state has only been during this recent decade of change.  The Colorado of 2020 is not the same as the Colorado of 2010 (or 1910); and El Paso County is not the same either.  As a redistricting commission, we are going to need to be equipped to use today’s data to inform choices around district boundaries which fairly represent the all the people of Colorado.  As one example, Colorado’s population of school-aged children has grown by 230,000 between 2010 and 2019.  This is likely to be the fastest growing segment of Colorado residents as the 2020 Census reporting becomes available.  As mother of school-aged children, I want to be sure the commission members analyze fairly the data put before them before drawing districts which have implications for both our current and next generations of voters and elected representatives.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I form my perspective based upon data.  I also believe that listening to others and discussing differences are critical skills to building consensus.  Part of my professional work is facilitating focus groups and small group discussions where I am asked to inquire actively, listen whole-heartly, understand empathetically, and manage time well.  Working in the consumer behavior field requires me to establish rapport quickly across people of different ages, genders, ethnicities, and life experiences around the world.  I believe these skills will serve me well in interacting with a diverse set of fellow commission members on a common set of objectives for the people of Colorado.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I organize, aggregate, and summarize multiple sources of information so that decisions makers can take action.  I have 30 years of experience with quantitative data analysis and statistical software packages, including performing analysis on US Census data files. I have taught quantitative analysis methods to 100s of business professionals.
