        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Terri Suzanne Wilson</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Terri Suzanne Wilson
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Assistant Professor, University of Colorado Boulder
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  PhD, Education, Teachers College Columbia University, 2010
BIS, Philosophy, Political Science and Education Policy, University of Minnesota, 2001
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80305
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Before becoming a professor, I worked with several school and community organizations, including in new immigrant communities, working to create reciprocal and respectful partnerships between universities and communities. I do work collaboratively with a range of parents, district officials and other constituents on our district&#39;s DAC (district accountability committee). I&#39;ve chaired the Data and Assessment committee, and played a lead role on the Charter School Application review committee, which often involved negotiating difficult--and vocal--constituencies on the committee, and those advocating various positions. Our committee had to craft careful, fair evaluation reports that could be understood and accepted by advocates both for--and against--expanding charter schools, and also ones that would hold up to subsequent review and appeal.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am a registered Democrat, and have volunteered for the campaign of Dan Feehan (doing GOTV calls, mostly), who ran for the 1st District Congressional seat in Minnesota (the district where I grew up). I have donated (very modest amounts!) to mostly MN political campaigns: Dan Feehan (2018 and 2020), Amy Klobuchar (2020 Democratic primary) and Biden/Harris (2020 Presidential election). I have also given money to Wellstone Action (a MN organization).


</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am mostly active in my local school district (serving on the BVSD DAC), and local school (University Hill Elementary). I also served on a state-wide commission to evaluate accountability measures for Alternative Education Campuses (AECs). Through my work and research at CU, I&#39;ve organized a number of outreach events to help communities better understand--and deliberate about--standards, accountability and assessment. I&#39;m committed to working across political lines to build opportunities for dialogue. I&#39;ve worked both on the Front Range and also in NE Colorado to hold community forums and smaller school-based dialogues.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I think there are far too few competitive districts--at both the state and federal level. Such safe districts erode democratic accountability, and often end up in legislators who are not asked to represent diverse, and divergent, viewpoints. I wonder if this situation also undermines the possibilities for political compromise and action. At the same time, I understand that districts also need to represent certain minoritized communities who may be under-represented in general or at-large elections. So, in a sense, I see the complexity of the issues, and hope to help consider these various viewpoints.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am a Democrat, but grew up in a small town with many different political allegiances. I believe that I have a strong ability to hear--and empathize--with other viewpoints. As a faculty member, I have participated on many standing and ad-hoc committees, and often find ways to listen to different viewpoints, forge consensus, and move groups forward productively. I believe my colleagues would say that I am kind, a good listener, and someone who can always keep a sense of humor. While I am a registered Democrat, I strongly believe in fair play, equal representation and respectful debate/ conversation across political positions.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am trained as a philosopher, and enjoy thinking through the various reasons, criteria or values at play in discussions. For instance, what principles or values might shape or guide redistricting choices? How might these principles be applied, fairly, and with an eye to their consequences, and the perhaps disparate consequences for differently situated groups? I also like careful and analytic writing, from meeting notes to final reports (sometimes an under-rated part of committee work!).
