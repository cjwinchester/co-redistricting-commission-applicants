  Attorney/Retired
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>

Practiced law in the areas of Estate Planning, Banking and Taxation. Admitted to practice until retirement to South Dakota Bar, Oklahoma Bar, Iowa Bar and Texas Bar.

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been active in the Republican party for the past elections since moving to Colorado in 2004. I have contributed to campaigns for Cory Gardner for Senate; George Brauchler for AG, Polly Lawrence for House, Frank McNulty for House, David Weaver for Sheriff, Tony Spurlock for Sheriff, Lora Thomas for Douglas County, Roger Partridge for Commissioner, Abe Laydon for Commissioner, George Teal for Commissioner, Trump for President, Ken Buck for House, Jon James for Senate, Lauren Boebert for House, Walker Stapleton for Governor, Bob Beauprez for Governor, John Kellner for DA, Randy Reed for Mayor (Castle Rock), Mike Coffman for House, Mike Coffman for Mayor, Colorado GOP, RNC, RNCC, RNSC. (I may have forgotten some, but if I have, it would be small local races for which I would have supported the GOP candidates)
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Bell Mountain Ranch Metropolitan District (Water) , Consolidated Bell Mountain Ranch Metropolitan District (President for 6 years, member for 6 1/2 years), Member South Dakota Bar Association, Oklahoma Bar Association, Iowa Bar Association, Texas State Bar.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
While most of the above state memberships were simply that, during my tenure on the two Metropolitan District noted, I led our board to the successful conclusion of a multiyear, multi-party lawsuit involving more than 12 parties in which it was alleged that the developer of our neighborhood had illegally transferred and sold water rights allegedly belonging to the neighborhood. I advocated for our Metropolitan districts to a settlement to the benefit of our entire community. It was required by our governing documents that we gain 209 signing households (2/3) to approve the settlement. This was no simple or easy task. We also had to accomplish this within 180 days or lose the deal. With my entire board&#39;s help and the help of members of our community, we achieved this goal by canvassing, holding informative meetings for Q and A, presentations by experts and counsel, and by publishing complete and multiple updates on the status of our negotiations and the impact to the community. In the end, we stopped the bleeding of cash to attorneys&#39; fees, and saved the community over $250,000 in indebtedness to the developer and another $2.5 Million in bond costs and fees through refinancing. This refinancing would not have been possible without the successful culmination of this legal battle and I could not have done this alone. This took creative and consistent communication and team building. I am proud to have been a key part of it.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe it imperative that the districting process be as transparent and as non-partisan as possible. The art of gerrymandering districts has for too long been allowed to become infected with partisan considerations. I was hopeful that the Supreme Court would provide guidance to remove partisanship, but since the ruling did not, we will be a sort of commission of first impression by utilizing citizen input from people who are interested in districting drawn with fairness and representation that makes sense to the ordinary voter. I have witnessed first hand in the states I have lived how the districting process can be a closed, insider track, lending itself to suspicion and downright fraud.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
First, I would ensure that I assure my fellow commissioners of my goals: to be fair and open-minded when considering the elements of redrawing the various districts. I would promote consensus by openly sharing research, issues, and known past problems from other jurisdictions struggling with the same issues. I believe that people acting in good faith have relatively few differences when it comes to seeking solutions, even to highly charged issues. I would try to emulate that good faith and good will at all times. I have been trained both in my study of literature, and the law to see both sides of analytical arguments and theories. I think those skills can translate into positive communications through civil discourse and reasoned discussions.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Having practiced as an attorney in the areas of Taxation, Estate Planning and Bank Closure and Resolution, I believe I can bring a host of analysis and logic skills to the table. I think one of the greatest and strongest arguments that can be made for a good facilitator is the ability to openly and quickly admit they are wrong. When I am wrong, I say so, when I am right, I try to listen why others may not agree and stay flexible enough to try to see the other side. If I am unable to convince others through the spoken word, I am willing to lay out the logic and analysis in writing to ensure full and positive understanding and counter views.
