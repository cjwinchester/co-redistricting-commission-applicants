<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As a native Coloradan, it is important to me to contribute toward shaping Colorado’s future. When voters in Colorado overwhelmingly approved Amendments Y &amp; Z, I knew I wanted to get involved in ensuring that democracy is protected in Colorado. I have a background as a communicator and journalist and have been a vocal advocate and writer for media literacy in education and voting rights. My interest in politics and history spans 40 years, and I am highly motivated to help ensure that Colorado’s Congressional and Legislative districts remain independent, which was underscored by voters in 2018.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My background as an independent consultant and leader in for-profit and non-profit organizations is an excellent match for your team. While my experience and training have been in communications, writing and public relations, I also have experience working with and on boards and collaborating with staff, volunteers and administrators. I understand the dynamics and the relationships boards and commissions have with their constituents, including educators, program directors, influencers and motivated volunteers . With my expertise in directing organizational identities and positioning, along with my ability to collaborate and compromise, I am well-positioned to significantly benefit your team. In addition, I have done significant research on board dynamics and how members collaborate (or not) and how practices can be improved to benefit teams and organizations. My ability to stay impartial stems from my training as a journalist who takes very seriously facts and information. In addition, as an ethics officer for a professional organization, I have built my reputation on a code of ethics that centers on honesty, fairness, transparency, empathy and advocacy.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Your mission is significant, and analyzing information, listening to one another and collaborating on solutions for reapportionment in Colorado will be key to the success of this team. I have demonstrated such skill sets throughout my career. For example, as team communications lead during the merger of two brokerage firms in 2007, I worked with a group of 50-plus individuals from two national investment firms to define, develop and distribute communications for the “go-forward” firm. This endeavor took two years and many hours of meetings, listening and collaborating with people from different cultures used to different practices. The experience allowed me to understand how diversity and different experiences can benefit team dynamics, and how information must be looked at holistically, objectively and thoughtfully to begin to create a new model.
