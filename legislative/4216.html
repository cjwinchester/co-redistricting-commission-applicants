<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on this commission to be able to provide an equitable opportunity for communities to be represented fairly. This will mean taking a look at the demographics, their needs, and how the community has grown over time, and what will be needed to provide equitable representation for their future. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have participated in various advisory boards, and board of directors. In that time I have encountered opposing views and determine that there needs to be a stance of listening to understand and then speaking to be understood. In addition, I believe that talking to the community to determine their needs and putting them first before moving forward with a decision. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
While working with COLOR and our community I have participated in research and analyzing participants&#39; responses in qualitative and quantitative methods to determine the results of the study and ways in which this research can be implemented to policies that can help our reproductive healthcare access efforts. In addition, Latino/a Advocacy day has allowed me to critically think and problem-solve on issues regarding access to resources, to reach rural areas, as well as determine what priorities need to be addressed with legislators. Another example within the future of work advisory council, I analyzed the differences across the state on access to continuing education, stackable credentials, and funding that schools and programs need to continue offering services. All of these experiences have given me the ability to look at problems, data, and be able to provide the best option for the best possible outcome.
