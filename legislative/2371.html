        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Sarah Foley</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Sarah Foley
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently unemployed.  In November 2018, I quit my job as a Product Manager at Lifeloc Technologies to take time off and travel with my husband.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Michigan State University:  BA Supply Chain Management
The University of Texas at Austin, McCombs School of Business:  MBA with a Concentration in Marketing
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80228
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Since January 2017, I have attended a number of demonstrations/marches/protests representing a range of issues including protecting women’s rights, protecting the ACA, advocating for Black Lives Matter, protesting gun violence, protesting Executive Order 13769, protesting the appointment of Amy Coney-Barrett to the Supreme Court, and protesting the election of Donald Trump.  While I often have strong political views, I am not particularly politically active.  

This is a fairly comprehensive list of campaigns and organizations to which I have donated based those with receipts and those I can remember:  Fair Fight, Inc., Joe Biden (President), Elizabeth Warren (President), Pete Buttigieg (President), Stacey Abrams (Governor), Beto O’Rourke (Senator), John Hickenlooper (Senator), Sara Gideon (Senator), Jamie Harrison (Senator), Amy McGrath (Senator), Heidi Heitkamp (Senator), Rev. Raphael Warnock (Senator), Nancy Pelosi (Congress), Jon Ossoff (Senator), Gary Peters (Senator), Hillary Clinton (President), Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, March for Our Lives.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am sorry to say that I have been wrapped up in my own life’s problems and that I have not been an active member of my community.  I would occasionally volunteer for a cancer organization called Love Hope Strength when it was still thriving.  I volunteered in an underprivileged second grade classroom in the spring of 2019.  
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I do not have any experience in organizing, representing, advocating for, or considering the interests of groups, organizations, or associations in Colorado or elsewhere.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My reason for applying to the commission is more of a calling than a desire per se.  At the risk of coming off conceited, I want someone like me on the commission.  I want our commissioners to be fair and impartial.  I want our commissioners to care about representing all Coloradans and not be focused on partisan gains.  Given that I am capable and possess the qualities necessary to aid in the success of the commission, I feel called to apply to serve.

While I would be honored to serve on the commission, I hope that the commission is representative.  It is important that we have a multi-cultural commission leading the redistricting efforts.  I care more about this than I do about being selected myself. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
When those in power seek to tip the scales in their favor, it undermines the democratic values we are supposed to uphold in this nation.  It does not establish justice; insure domestic tranquility; promote the general warfare; nor does it secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.  Gerrymandering is a perversion of justice and is antithetical to the principles set by our forefathers in the creation of the United States.

I have been called for jury duty three times and have been selected for juries three times.  Perhaps what comes though during the jury selection process is that I will be as impartial as possible.  Being honest, fair, and just is inherent to my nature.  What I will bring to the table is a desire to be fair and ensure those who historically have been underrepresented are protected in the redistricting.  

My career success to date is largely due to the strengths of relationships I have built with internal colleagues and external partners.  I believe I have been able to effectively lead cross-functional teams due to my ability to earn the trust of others which is largely owed to my dependability, sincerity, and friendly nature.  I do not have any concerns about my ability to quickly build relationships with my fellow commissioners nor do I have any doubt that I can prompt consensus because I have plenty of examples from both my career and personal life.  I am pragmatic, persuasive, and capable of working with people who bring a variety of opinions and goals.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Every position I have held required a strong aptitude for analysis. I have examined TV sales to determine promotional pricing, studied consumers’ consumption habits to derive insights about brand loyalty, forecasted sales, and evaluated financial performance against P&amp;L goals.  To be an effective product manager I had to identify, understand, and anticipate the needs of my customers.  I have a proven track record of using analytical skills to solve problems across countless unique circumstances.  Being able to analyze data that comes out of the census results and applying that to the mapping out districts sounds fascinating to me.
