<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In the past I was active with the Arapahoe County Democrats but have not been the last 10 years. This  year I donated $25 to John Hickenlooper’s campaign and gave $30 to Diane Mitch Bush, $30 to the  Biden/Harris campaign and $30 to Cal Cunningham’s campaign.  I probably donated to Meg Froelich in the past as she is a good friend. Twenty years ago I was active in organizing house district democratic fundraisers and worked on a state house district campaign, but I have not done that in at least 15 years.   
This year I helped get out the vote by working to inform my community when ballots were being sent, how to change addresses, how to register to vote through Neighborhood Nextdoor.  I am vocal about encouraging everyone to vote, without telling them how to vote. People at my office ask me to review ballot initiatives with them every year there are ballot initiatives, so I explain what the impact of the initiatives and whether they impact the constitution or statute, without telling them how to vote.

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have served on the Smoky Hill Metropolitan District from 2015 until the present.  This group is a special district for my neighborhood. We oversee finances for the district and work with the local home owners association.   I was very involved with the Denver School of the Arts when my daughter attended there, chairing multiple fundraisers, graduation dinners, all of the chaperoning (from theatre field trips to Shakespeare Festival). I still work to bring parents together through theatre outings, care packages for our children in college, and celebrating our successes (pre pandemic).  I also help find assistance for those friends who need it and am known as a connector per Malcom Gladwell’s “Outliers.”   I coordinate with the DCPA to distribute discount theatre tickets to a group of approximately 650 people, although this is on pause due to the pandemic.   In addition, I judge community theatre around Colorado, from Creede to Ft. Collins, for the Colorado Theatre Guild and have been a judge with them since 2018.

Briefly discuss your experience in organizing, representing, advocating for, or considering the interests of groups, organizations, or associations in Colorado.
As Government Relations Director for Professional Assist Corporation, I advocate on behalf of massage therapists and cosmetologists nationwide.  I attend regulatory board meetings and rule- making hearings to advocate for our members. Prior to the pandemic, I was traveling to different state meetings about twice a week. I am known and sought after with most massage therapy boards and administrators to work with them on regulations and legislative issues. I also work with state legislators and committee staff in various states on issues regarding expanding scope for estheticians or licensure (in the 4 remaining states without licensure) for massage therapists. In Colorado, I have worked with DORA to help draft rules on licensure here in Colorado.  I have developed a working relationship with these boards and administrators in Colorado. In addition, I work with local representatives of the other Massage Therapy Association, AMTA, well. People have noted that we have not worked well with them in the past. That has changed with me coming on board - we are stronger together. 

My previous work included advocating for animal welfare issues with the Denver Dumb Friends League. I worked with the Department of Agriculture and with other western region shelters and animal welfare organizations in that job.

I am a leadership junkie and am a graduate of the Colorado Institute for Leadership Training, Emily’s List training, Run Vote Lead training,  Leadership Roaring Fork – where we talked of leadership training and issues affecting the Roaring Fork Valley – , the Colorado Capitol Conference headed up by Senators Udall and Bennet in Washington DC, and the Bighorn Leadership Program (twice). The first Bighorn cohort I participated in was on Renewables, and I worked on a team that created a public/private pilot program for Colorado regarding pine beetle mitigation. We drafted a bill that passed in 2006. I also participated in the Bighorn Leadership Program in 2018 on Energy issues. I really enjoy the camaraderie in these cohorts and the minds that are together talking about how to move Colorado forward in a manner that benefits all.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have lived in Colorado my whole life (except a brief 5-month stint in DC after college). I am a Colorado policy wonk, and I have a strong interest in making sure we fairly redistrict based on equal population in Colorado whether it is at the state legislative level or the congressional level. I am opposed to gerrymandering from either side and believe we need to have equal representation in our congressional and legislative districts. I think I would be an asset to the commission with my knowledge of Colorado communities. I know this state.  Participating in the redistricting commission would be a great honor and a chance to work with others to come to a good conclusion for our elections over the next 10 years.

Some of my knowledge is through personal experience.  I have experience working in Craig by introducing some of my students to the importance of the coal mine and the jobs it offers and offering my students a different perspective, and my sister lived in South Fork for many years so I know the San Luis Valley well and continue to have friends who are environmentalists and century ranchers in the Valley I have traveled extensively within Colorado, and gained a deep passion for the communities of Lamar and Springfield, and know and love Pueblo and the Wet Mountains.

I also have held several professional positions that have taken me to all corners of our state    For several years I was Executive Director of a leadership program that would accept up to 40 people per year; the program  traveled to 10 different communities  over six moths in Colorado to discuss various policy issues. We heard about urban and rural education issues, early childhood education and higher education funding in Pueblo. We studied water issues from numerous perspectives, including industrial use in the oil and gas fields near Rifle and Colorado River water impacts in Carbondale and Glenwood Springs, the impact of urban water development for Denver and other large cities,  and agricultural water issues in the Arkansas Valley. We toured Rifle’s oil and gas fields, Craig’s coal mine, and farms near Lamar. We discussed ranching economic issues in Springfield and the San Luis Valley.  My goal was to educate the participants  so that when they went back to their leadership roles, whether running for the legislature running a non-profit, they would remember the rural communities we visited and remember the sometime unexpected impacts urban policies have on rural communities. 

I have a deep passion for Colorado and all our communities and try to encourage policy makers to remember the diversity of cultures in our state, as well as taking into account communities of interest and not splitting up rural counties. As examples, I have testified at redistricting hearings in 2011 in Castle Rock. And in 2006 I approached several legislators about increasing the number of Colorado’s legislative districts to better balance urban and rural interests in the state house.  I was – and am -- concerned that due to population decreases in rural communities, the geographic size of rural districts will grow larger but fewer representatives and senators would come from those districts.  As cities grow, legislative power becomes focused in the large population centers.  This is a personal concern of mine, as I live on the outskirts of the Denver metro area.  Given the geographic changes in Colorado’s population, someone in my suburban neighborhood could eventually represent the entire eastern plains, even though that person might have no agricultural experience and no understanding of the challenges faced by smaller towns.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
One of my greatest advocacy skills is to listen to all sides of an issue and try to encourage a consensus to address the issues. I am not an “I’m right” kind of a personality. I am very successful and respected nationwide as Government Relations Director for the Professional Assist Corporation as a result of my personality and my knowledge. I can get my point across without being aggressive and am open to conversation to find common ground. I strive to be fair, especially in this hyperpartisan time we live in. 
Back in the early 2010s, I was traveling the western slope to talk with ranchers and hunters about BLM 10 year plans. What did they want their region to look like? I worked with people in Rangely, Rifle, and Meeker to have a conversation about the Land and Water Conservation Fund and BLM long range plans and was able to have conversations from those communities. I worked with Upper Arkansas Valley communities when talking about the Browns Canyon National Monument. I am frankly good at having conversations with people around Colorado and look forward to the opportunity to create a fair redistricting map for those communities.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am a graduate of The University of Denver, College of Law. I do not practice law, but I do use the skills I learned in law school to analyze laws and regulations around the country. I am able to apply laws and regulations to situations and explain the laws and regulations to our members throughout the country. One recent success was two summers ago; I sent a letter to our members in Indiana explaining when and how Indiana’s new licensing law was coming into effect.  The regulatory agency responsible for those licensing changes had not taken and resisted taking a position on when licensing came into effect. After I sent my letter, the Board posted the portion of my letter on its website to explain the licensure effective date to the public. Having said that, I am not brash or pushy. I am logical.
