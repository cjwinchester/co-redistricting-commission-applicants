<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Lead and co-lead the Represent.US Denver chapter at various times. Helped draft a campaign ethics bill for the city/county of Denver (the bulk of it&#39;s language was adopted as Denver Referred Measure 2E) working with other non-partisan and cross-partisan groups to draft said language. I have circulated petitions for a small number of &quot;good governance&quot; measures (the Denver Democracy for the People Initiative--that became 2E). I have supported Colorado &quot;good governance&quot; measures to include Amendments Y and Z (for example: https://denverite.com/2018/10/18/jennifer-lawrence-wants-you-to-illegalize-gerrymandering-in-colorado/). And I have been involved with a number of non-political organizations (such as the&quot;Como Project&quot; DSP&amp;P Railway).

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am fiercely independent. I have NEVER belonged to a political party, and I absolutely revile the use of government systems to benefit any political party. The idea that political parties have used their power to redraw district lines to benefit the parties is in my mind the antithesis of what a representative democracy should be. And while I don&#39;t believe that Colorado has a major Gerrymandering problem like other states do, I don&#39;t want Colorado to have such a problem in the future.

Additionally, as a resident of very rural Clear Creek County, I believe that I can bring a &quot;mountain perspective&quot; to the commission. I also am privileged enough to enjoy a career and a job that would allow me to participate in this critical process, without major disruption of my professional life or paycheck. I feel like most working age residents might generally not attempt to participate for just this reason, leaving overrepresentation by groups who don&#39;t the encumbrance of a job.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have spent over 10,000 hours flying airplanes, which is mostly an exercise in assessing information, and building consensus amongst the operating crew members, a skill that I have honed to a pretty high degree. I also served a term as an elected leader for a pilots union (IBT Local 357), during one of the most contentious bargaining environments in Railway Labor Act history. It was one of the driving factors for me running for that position, and I largely acted as the &quot;independent&quot; board member making peace between factions on our board. As part of my experience in union representation, I eventually developed the skills to handle EXTREMELY sensitive discussions (including high stakes discipline, substance abuse issues, harassment cases, hostile membership, and negotiations) respectfully amongst parties who typically displayed open disdain for one another. 

As a dyed in the wool independent, I would be unencumbered by partisan pressures entirely, while being naturally inclined towards consensus building as the most effective form of agreement. I operate in a world that requires a shared mental model and buy in of any decision in an airplane, it&#39;s a way of life for me, and has been for over 20 years in my professional life. I also like to think that I am really good at letting bygones be bygones. A disagreement with another person on one topic does not need to effect other attempts to build consensus with that person, and it is incredibly important to disagree without being disagreeable with one another. I basically cannot recall the last time I disagreed with someone I was working on the same task with--I believe because my skills at building a shared mental model lead to consensus so efficiently that things never rise to the level of a real disagreement. Impartiality is achieved both by my fierce non partisan belief and lifelong devotion to non partisanship, along with the inclusion of fairness and impartiality as critical criteria to work for. People are allowed to have their own beliefs (including partisan motivations that I might agree or disagree with), but that does not necessarily mean that their viewpoint is not valid and deserving of thoughtful consideration.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My professional life consists of taking a packet of information (weather, aircraft mechanical state, airport conditions, terrain considerations, and in some cases geopolitical considerations) and distilling that information into a useable plan to accomplish a given task (to fly from point A to B). This involves the rest of the flight crew I am operating with (I have been a captain, first officer, and relief pilot at various times, all of which involve different leadership gradients), a dispatcher with joint responsibility, and many other entities during complex flights. All of this must end up with a consensus on how we should operate the flight. From the moment that plan is agreed to, it is continually monitored and re-evaluated, and adjusted should conditions warrant. All of this while weighing pros and cons, and operating under a continually ticking clock and continually depleting fuel reserves. In less time critical situations (which is how the commission would operate), I tend to prioritize a task by critical criteria, starting with what seems most pressing. Once prioritized, I seek to apply any desirable criteria--especially if I am working with others who might rank the criteria differently than I do. And once a workable plan appears to be presented, I seek ways to test that plan against the criteria, and adjust it if necessary.
