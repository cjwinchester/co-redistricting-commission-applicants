<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
In 1969 I entered Colorado State University (CSU) as a Political Science major. My interest in the democratic process was strong then and has continued to grow. After working at CSU for 44 years and nearing retirement in May 2021 I have maintained my strong interest in volunteer public service and citizen participation in the political process. The Colorado Independent Redistricting Commission offers an excellent opportunity to serve the state of Colorado. The commission provides a solution to promote fair redistricting. I have a strong belief that the process of redistricting should be guided by transparency and public input. Additionally, I believe that maps should fairly reflect the will of the voters and that the redistricting commission can improve outcomes and satisfaction across all stakeholders. Protecting the voting rights of persons-of-color, and balancing the preservation of communities of interest with the preservation of county and municipal boundaries is vitally important. Serving on the commission requires the ability to be fair and impartial. For the past 30 years at CSU, I have served as an Equal Opportunity Representative on university search committees, a responsibility that has fairness and impartiality at its core. Additionally, my doctoral dissertation was on ethical decision-making. I taught an Ethics course at the graduate level for over ten years, conducted ethics workshops for the university and community, and presented on ethical decision making at conferences nationally and internationally. The quest for fairness has been a lifetime endeavor. At CSU, I have served on a joint-appointment as both an administrator and faculty member for 37 years. In my faculty role I served as Program Chair for a Masterâ€™s program with over 30 faculty which required the ability to promote consensus and agreement on a daily basis. I was able to develop a collegial environment and build consensus on curricular development, course content, and student issues. Effectively promoting agreement involved listening, collaboration, and clear communication. For the past 12 years I have served at the Executive Director of Assessment and Research at CSU. A position that requires analytical skills and the ability to apply logic. The position involves analyzing numerous quantitative and qualitative research and assessment projects, evaluating programs and services, and guiding departments through their five-year program reviews. I have been very successful in using the data to help the institution increase its effectiveness and improve its programs. I also served at the Director of Research on the board of directors of the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators (NASPA), and chaired the Committee on Commissioned Research for the Association of College and University Housing Officers â€“ International (ACUHO-I). In addition to analytical skills and the application of logic, the coin of the realm in all of these positions is trust and credibility. I am currently working half-time and will be fully retiring from CSU at the end of May, 2021. I make the best of every day and look forward to contributing considerable time to the commission. All my best, David A. McKelfresh
