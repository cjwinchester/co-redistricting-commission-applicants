<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My political experience after 2015 includes corporate PAC management; Founder of Dimension Strategies, a consulting firm; and the Latina Initiative, a fiscally sponsored non-profit.

In 2015 I entered the corporate sector as a fundraising professional and started a position at Xcel Energy as a manager of its Political Action Committees. Xcel Energy has one national PAC and six state PACs, which include Colorado, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Arizona and North and South Dakota. This was a bipartisan program giving employees an opportunity to participate in political engagement by making financial contributions to the PACs. I created and led an employee steering committee to guide the strategic fundraising plan for the national and Colorado state PAC. From the CEO and executive leadership to utility workers on the ground, employees were given a platform to show political support through financial contributions. I was given a unique lens to view engagement patterns where I sought to elevate participation in electing federal and state candidates. It was a platform for political engagement that would serve the policies of a corporate utility. As the director, I had the opportunity to work with elected officials across Xcel’s territories so that our employees could participate in uniquely created events that would provide face-to-face interaction with their representatives. The PAC spent over one million dollars each election cycle to support policy makers who were aligned with smart legislation and policies that would benefit the company.
 
After my time at Xcel I became a Founding Partner at Dimension Strategies, a minority and women-owned business. While the business model includes political work, it is only a small part of our portfolio. A core component of our mission is to support the efforts of Latinos to become leaders in non-profits, government, and business. As experts on community and civic engagement, we offer our clients outreach strategies to include communities of color and other underserved communities. From issues in education and environment to strategic planning for non-profits and businesses, Dimension Strategies understands the diverse intricacies of Colorado communities.
 
Most recently I founded the Latina Initiative 2020 which is a fiscally sponsored 501c3 advocating for young Latinas to exercise their vote. During the 2020 cycle we created and launched a digital campaign in Colorado to mobilize low to mid-propensity voters which would increase the impact of the Latina vote. This non-partisan effort was successful and communicated to Latinas that their voice is their power and demonstrated to them that they could have a meaningful impact on elections. The Initiative’s non-profit status precluded it from advocating for specific candidates and issues.  I devised a research program that would inform us about what mattered most to Latinas. Using a well-thought-out digital strategy we were able to obtain over 2 million impressions, and a sharp increase in Latina voting patterns. The Latina Initiative will seek its own non-profit status in 2021. I am currently creating a long-term plan to continue our efforts to educate and engage Latinas.

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My career began during my undergraduate education as an organizer for congressional campaigns and environmental organizations. After pursuing an advanced degree, I moved to Washington D.C. to work with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) to organize, fundraise and recruit political candidates to run for congress in targeted races throughout the west, mid-west and northeast. The diverse jurisdictions gave me exposure to dozens of communities and the unique way in which each were established. From conservatives in Missouri to moderates in Connecticut I developed the political knowledge and skills to be an effective guide across a spectrum of issues and communities. Each constituency was different and a delicate balance was always required in directing and leading the candidates to successful outcomes. 

In 2006 I moved to Colorado to work for Congressman Perlmutter in his first congressional bid. As a member of the leadership team I gained deep insight into the 7th district’s constituency. At the time, we raised more money than any congressional race in Colorado’s  history. My work with the Perlmutter campaign showed me the importance of constituent work. The Congressman required the team to show up for all constituents regardless of their politics. His commitment to his community was strong and his willingness to work for all people in this district was remarkable.

After my congressional work I moved into municipal politics to work for Councilwoman Deborah Ortega, an at-large member of Denver City Council. This gave me an opportunity to work with every community across the City. From potholes and major infrastructure needs, to complex budgets and line items I was in a position to have an immediate impact on the lives of Denver citizens. We worked closely with individual council districts to address city issues and capitalize on opportunities to make the city a better place. The diversity in Denver is vast and each district represents underserved communities, corporate interests and a long list of non-profits. I frequently worked as a surrogate for the Councilwoman and was able to work with neighborhood organizations, powerful developers and everyone in between. Her constituents became mine and her advocacy for the underserved has made her one of the best leaders in Denver.
 
My experience demonstrates strong organization and advocacy for diverse communities. I worked with people on both sides of the isle to grow support and engagement which strengthens the fabric of our collective interests. I have had the pleasure of being an advocate for entities who make a difference and seek to better the State of Colorado.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Safe-guarding against the manipulation of district maps is paramount to protecting all communities and ensuring all voices are heard, not just the loudest voices.
It is my job as a community engagement specialist to work with all people regardless of their political interests. My portfolio includes a unique skillset which I would bring to the commission. To participate in the realignment of districts impacted by population change requires someone with a deep understanding and respect for the community. Fair voting districts give equal footing to citizens to have a say in how and by whom they are governed. To participate in protecting the Voting Rights Act and preserving community and political competitiveness would be the ultimate privilege. I want to lend my experience to the development of a fair process ensuring equal access for all constituents.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
It is the commission’s responsibility to uphold the requirements for redistricting and work to ensure that all are represented regardless of political affiliation. This commission is an important building block required by our democratic duties.
 
While we operate in an adversarial system, I believe we must incorporate overall fairness while still rigorously advocating for our clients’ interests. In honoring the Colorado Constitution, we must acknowledge how it has evolved and changed over time both through newly created laws and longstanding precedent. Although adherence to these principals is imperfect, the creation of the commission is an important platform. 
 
As the wife of an assistant deputy district attorney, I watch my husband work for victims and defendants to achieve an outcome that is fair to all parties. Sometimes crimes are so egregious and the victims suffer so greatly that we fail to consider the rights of the defendant and pursue a path to hold them accountable while still providing for their possible reform in time. My familiarity with such issues and tensions facilitates my ability to encourage fairness and impartiality when appropriate.

The position of a commissioner requires the experience and mindset of individuals who represent fairness and consensus among groups who are traditionally at odds over values and ideals. This is by no means an easy position to fill, but you must consider individuals, who based on results, have shown due consideration for the entire community, even amidst disagreement.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a business owner I strive to elevate clients in their community engagement efforts. The relevant strategies and tactics I use require careful analysis of a clients’ unique attributes. We have the tendency to put communities in buckets which can result in a soloing effect. For instance, having worked with Latino populations in our state I understand that it isn’t strategic to place them in a bucket because Latinos are not a monolithic group. The work I do for my clients requires identifying groups of people and running analyses to identify micro-targeting strategies that will ensure the appropriate messages and messengers are used and will have the greatest impact.
 
My legal experience includes complex analysis to break down the laws and decisions made by Congress and the courts. My technical writing is strong and I enjoy breaking down the sum of the legal parts and then developing a strong argument by putting the elements back together with the facts. To ensure consistency, there needs to be a standard for approaching a problem so one can better evaluate the outcomes.
