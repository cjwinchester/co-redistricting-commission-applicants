        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Carolyn Mitchell</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Carolyn Mitchell
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Carolyn J. Mitchell</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am on hiatus from employment.  My background is in the legal field, most recently (2.5 years ago) as in-house counsel for national, publicly traded builder.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  1990 Glenelg High School, 1994 BA (Psychology major and history minor) from the University of Delaware, 2000 JD from the University of Denver Sturm College of Law
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80218
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My past political activity is fairly minimal.  Personally and more recently I have engaged locally with the City and County of Denver regarding various zoning and planning issues in our neighborhood and throughout the City.  I have not been very involved from a contribution perspective in many campaigns or causes until about nine months ago when we donated to the Black Lives Matter Campaign, the When We All Vote Campaign, Change.org.  In my professional capacity I served on the Executive Committee for the Colorado Association of Home Builders as the Governmental Affairs Committee Member and Chair for a few years and as a member of the political action committee which distributed significant amounts of money to local, state, and federal campaigns of those who were aligned with the goals of the home building industry.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I belong to the Seventh Avenue Neighborhood Association, I have been a member of the Colorado Bar Association, and as mentioned above I served in a professional capacity on various committees and organizations within the Colorado Association of Home Builders.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As part of a group of neighbors we banded together to prevent a zoning exception in our neighborhood, a few of us were more of the organizers.  Professionally as an attorney, I was responsible to literally organize, represent, and advocate for the interests of my various clients over almost 20 years of practice in various fora to include state court, federal court, local commission hearings, media, in talking with government representatives both in public and private, in talking or mediating with customers, business partners, and other stake holders to facilitate the desired ends while bringing the various interests to the table and including their perspectives and obtaining their buy in.  I have also completed over forty hours of mediation training where I honed the skills to bring divergent interests together and reach mutual resolution.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am quietly passionate about the integrity of our governmental systems and processes and while I am on hiatus from my career, which is transitioning from attorney advocacy to mediation, I have the time, the skills, the interest, and the energy to engage with this commission in a very meaningful way.  I cannot think of many, if any, other better ways to use my time and experience than to facilitate and preserve our governmental structures and processes.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The reason I am unaffiliated is that I believe each person should evaluate each issue on its merits and come to their own conclusion without deferring to others.  It is a very real concern I have that a number of these deferrals are made by those in power to other party members in an effort make personal or professional gain instead of effecting the will of their constituents.  In thinking through the issues that will be before this commission I do not have an agenda or preconceived notion of the end result, aside from maintaining the integrity of the process.  All of my training, all of my experience, and all of my inherent nature are focused on the ability and preference to be fair and impartial.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As mentioned above I have over twenty years of experience using my training as an attorney and as a mediator where the entire job is to apply logic and reason, including case law and precedent and data and facts, to any number of scenarios and situations in order to find a path forward for all the stakeholders.
