</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
The work I do in my professional business provides facilitation and organization building for groups and businesses around Colorado. I have worked with a diversity of organizations that represent a wide swath of employees, values, and political stances. I have worked on behalf of young people of color in Denver as well as an audience that is state-wide and trends older and less diverse. I have worked for entities in space and aeronautics, fundraising, tourism, finance, entrepreneurship, and digital health tech. My personal passion is women&#39;s empowerment, which comes across in my work by engaging with women-owned and -led organizations, and is reflected in the spaces where I volunteer. I hold civic engagement to be one of the most important aspects of my life.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am a native Coloradan. I fiercely love this state. It was a great point of pride that in the most recent election, our state had one of the highest levels of voter turnout in the country. It would be an honor to work with Coloradans from around the state to examine how our population has changed so that our state may best represent all those within its borders. I don&#39;t believe we can build a better future for our state without all voices heard and without everyone in some way supportive of the final outcome. I want our state to continue to be a beacon of civic engagement and dialogue.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my work as a facilitator, I strive every day to ensure that all voices are heard. I will translate that work into my involvement on the commission. I despise arguing, but I thrive on positive, constructive dialogue. I have a strong voice but prefer to listen to all as I process my thoughts. While I am a white woman, I am incredibly cognizant of the huge numbers of people in Colorado who look different from me. My hope would be to listen to as many of those different voices as possible and reconcile their different Colorado experiences and needs with the best path forward for our state.  I am a proud Democrat socially. However, I was raised here in Colorado as a strong Republican and I retain a lot of those fiscal beliefs. I am fortunate to call a politically diverse group of people family and friends. I want all their voices heard and would be honored to be their representative.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My daily work consists of analyzing all information available to me, problem solving the challenges facing an organization, and providing guidance and decision-making to the organization leadership on how best to build capacity and successfully grow. In small and large group facilitations, I am able to identify challenges, coalesce group thinking, and provide guidance to get a disparate group to the next step in their process. One of the most important aspects of my work is being empathetic to all voices while keeping the larger goal as a focus. I would bring this approach to any commission engagement.
