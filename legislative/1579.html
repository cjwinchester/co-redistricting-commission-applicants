  Doctorate in Computer Science from UCLA in 2001; Masters in Applied Mathematics from U.C. San Diego in 1993,  Bachelors in Mathematics and Computer Science from U.C. San Diego in 1990,  Pueblo Central High Graduate in 1986
</p>

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated a wide range of Democratic candidates at the federal, state, and local levels. My donations typically range between $25 to $250, with one larger donation to Phil Weiser from a house party we hosted in 2018.  Candidates I have donated to include Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Hillary Clinton, John Hickenlooper,  Andrew Romanoff, Jena Griswold, Phil Weiser,  Karen McCormick, Jonathan Singer, and Annmarie Jenson.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I currently serve on the advisory boards for the Adams12 School District Computer Science program and St. Vrain Valley School District Cybersecurity and AI program. I served as board member for Silicon Flatirons.  With respect to professional organizations, I am a current member and have presented at multiple events for the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), the Armed Forces Communications &amp; Electronics Association (AFCEA) and the Colorado Computer Science Teachers Association. I am a Senior Member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I&#39;m experienced working with a variety of stakeholders in government, academia, and industry.  For example, I&#39;ve worked in on cybersecurity issues on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security and was able to establish joint consortiums between the government and several of the largest automotive manufacturers.  I helped  develop and am one of the editors for an international technical standard to secure the Internet&#39;s Domain Name System (IETF RFC 4033, 4034, and 4035).  This technical standard required achieving consensus from industry and governments around the globe and  is now mandatory for U.S. Government system and widely used throughout the world.   I&#39;ve helped create new programs at both Colorado State University and the University of Colorado Boulder.   Currently I&#39;m leading a program for the U.S. Department of Defense to enable secure use of 5G wireless in both the U.S. and international partners which requires coordination between standards bodies, governments and industry.   These activities share a common theme of bringing together diverse groups with opposing interests to arrive at a consensus. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
District boundaries matter.  Obviously districts gain a lot of attention and play a critical role during election season, but districts play a much larger role in connecting Colorado government to Colorado citizens.  Districts mattered when my family was impacted by the 2013 floods. As we tried to salvage possessions and searched for temporary housing, we did not care whether our government representatives had an (D) or (R) after their names.  Instead, we cared deeply about whether our representatives understand the challenges our community faced and could effectively represent the needs and concerns of our community during this crisis. Earlier this fall other Colorado communities faced unprecedented fires and I&#39;m certain the people impacted these fires cared deeply that their government representatives understood and reflected their communities. Of course districts don&#39;t just during elections and during a crisis.  Districts and the corresponding government representatives help amplify successes such as achievements by students in our schools or the opening or expanding of economic opportunities.  Whether impacted by a disaster or celebrating a success, Colorado government is best connected to the people of Colorado when our districts reflect our communities and share in both their challenges and successes.  Political parties are clearly an important aspect and we are reminded of that each election season, but we must not lose track of the fact everyone (regardless of political affiliation) does better when our districts reflect our communities.  I&#39;ve been fortunate to be a member of several distinct Colorado communities.  I was born and raised in Pueblo.  For over 15 years, I&#39;ve been a resident of Longmont.  My wife of over 20 years is a native of Denver and we have two daughters in St. Vrain Valley Schools.  While we have lived in other areas of the country, our time living outside of Colorado only served to reinforce the advantages of Colorado. We want to do our part to help ensure Colorado continues to succeed.  Colorado succeeds when all citizens feel connected to and represented by their government.  I strongly believe this is achieved by districts that are constructed to represent Colorado citizens.  I want to be part of the process that helps ensure Colorado districts fairly and accurately represent all Colorado citizens. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The objective of the commission is to create districts that fairly and accurately represent the citizens of Colorado. While of course the political structure matters, I expect we can achieve consensus by also asking questions such as &quot;Is this district map you want in a disaster such as a fire or flood?&quot; or  &quot;Is this the district map that will help the district succeed?&quot;  I believe we can achieve consensus by focusing on this primary objective of ensuring fair and accurate representation.  This becomes highly contentious if viewed solely as a partisan exercise, but becomes an opportunity for everyone to succeed if it becomes an exercise to ensure the diverse Colorado communities are reflected by our districts and our residents feel they have a voice in their government.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have experience leading nonpartisan federal efforts to improve cybersecurity for critical infrastructure.  While my work has focused primarily on technical issues, the techniques to achieve consensus in large groups are general.  Whether working with students at the university or working to achieve international agreements, consensus is achieved by listening to all opinions, conceding when you learn a different position is in fact a better choice, and keeping the larger group focused on our shared objective that benefits.  In this case, districts that fairly and accurately represent the citizens of Colorado ultimately benefit everyone and if selected to the commission I would be a strong advocate for finding that common ground.
