<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Marianne Z. Wamboldt
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Marianne Wamboldt</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently a Professor Emerita from the University of Colorado.  I was a Professor of Psychiatry at UC, served as the Chair of Child Psychiatry at the University as well as Children&#39;s Hospital, and as the head of Pediatric Psychosocial Medicine at National Jewish.  I retired in July 2020.  I continue to mentor junior colleagues, consult to a federally funded grant that works on improving mental health access for depressed adolescents.  I am now ready to serve my community in different ways. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I received a BS, Magna Cum Laude, from Marquette University in 1976.  I had been a Philosophy and Biology double major.  I then went to University of Wisconsin Madison for my MD degree, and received that in 1981.  I did a residency in Psychiatry at UW, then went to the National Institute of Mental Health to learn clinical research.  Finally, I came to University of Colorado to get my specialty in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, which I accomplished in 1990.  Since then, I have worked at National Jewish Health, Children&#39;s Hospital of Colorado, and the University Hospital until my retirement.  In 2014, I received my teacher training in Yoga, as I was using this intervention to help teens with depression and anxiety.

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I have said this above.  I have not done much with political groups, focussing more of my time on professional groups, for my career. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Most of the political donations I have made have gone to Andrew Romanoff.  I also donate small amounts to Act Blue to support a number of Democratic candidates, including Biden.  I was a founding member of the AACAP PAC, which was the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry&#39; s PAC.  We donate to bipartisan members of Congress who support issues that will improve mental health in adolescents.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am the leader of the Colorado Solidarity Sunday group which was founded in 2016.  We met monthly until the pandemic, helped support Jason Crow&#39;s election, and have focussed this year on getting out the vote.  We are loosely connected with Indivisible, lead in our state by Jody Rein.  

I had been involved with St. Elizabeth Catholic Church, working on the Faith Formation Committee as well as in the Choir, until our pastor was transferred to Regis University.  Since then, I attend Catholic Mass there. 

I mostly was involved with professional organizations, including the American Psychiatric Assn., the Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, The Society fo Behavioral Genetics, The American Family Therapy Assn.  I held offices and chaired committees in these various groups. 

I was a board member and president of the Family Process Institute (https://www.familyprocess.org) for 10 years and consult to them now.  &quot;The Family Process Institute oversees the Family Process journal and creates initiatives that promote family and systems theory, practice, research, and policy, with a commitment to social justice.&quot;
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
 Now that I am retired, I want to focus my skills on improving our state and community for my children and grandchildren, who all live here.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As I trained psychiatrist, trained in the family therapy approach more than a Freudian approach, I have spent my career learning to bring groups together.  I have training to help people express their thoughts and feelings in a way that does not attack others, to find common ground, and to make progress toward mutually agreed upon goals. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As an academic researcher, I have been an investigator on numerous grants and research projects.  I know statistics, and loved doing my own data analysis.  I use a number of statistical programs.  As a philosophy major in  college, I learned  how to think through issues logically. I am also a classical pianist, where I focus on Bach, who is a &quot;logical&quot; composer.  This way of thinking comes to me naturally.
