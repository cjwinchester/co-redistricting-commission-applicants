</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated to the Sierra Club and to the campaigns of some friends of mine. They include Christina Haswood of Kansas and Kacie Weicherding of Illinois. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am a member of IGNITE national which is a non-partisan organization that supports women in politics. I have served for various PTA positions at my sons schools from 2017 to present. I am an alumni member of the National Society of Leadership and Success, having served as community service chair and president.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My greatest desire is to contribute to Colorado in a way that is unique to our time. I grew up here, I have lived in Colorado my entire life and am in awe at the growth that our state has seen. Every day I am reminded that the districts that my residence is assigned to does not match the metropolitan area that we conduct our daily activities in. Colorado has welcomed diverse populations, has new regions of wealth and poverty, is facing continued struggles to ascertain and manage natural resources and is also projected to maintain steady growth. I truly believe that without a comprehensive team to address redistricting Colorado will not be able to manage the challenges of our future. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As someone who has never identified as democratic or republican I see beyond party divisions in a time when the aisle seems larger than it ever has before. I am someone who promotes reason and inclusion of all opinions while not letting emotion dominate conversations. I rely on facts and data to weigh my decisions and foster the ability to compromise with others without creating feelings of defeat or resentment. As a corporate trainer I can quickly identify the personalities I work with and can easily adapt every conversation to become approachable and easy to work with. I do not weigh my success in my own achievements but rather in the collaborative achievements of the groups I work with. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a logic driven person I do not divulge in opinions or emotions when making a decision. I assess the data, apply it to what is known and what is projected, and base my decisions from there. When addressing a problem I break it down to subsets of identifiable factors, and from those factors I draw a list of steps to address each factor individually and as they fit into the larger problem. When I think I have addressed the aspects of the problem, I seek council from someone with more experience or a different thought process than I before proceeding with my plan. My ability to admit when I need help always improves the outcome of my problem solving efforts.
