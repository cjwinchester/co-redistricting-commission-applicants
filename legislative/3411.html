<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have never been interested in running for elected office nor running a political campaign. The power dynamics involved in politics are unappealing to me. However, I do actively practice political and civic engagement: making donations to campaigns, attending local rallies and marches, and signing petitions for issues on both the national and regional level. I pursue information and debates on electoral, political, and policy issues, keeping informed about matters that not only affect me but also affect my fellow Coloradans and our nation. I believe that information and education provide means to think critically, to make balanced decisions, and to form opinions. Being an informed citizen is the basis for political activity.

List of donations to political organizations and campaigns since 2015
MoveOn, Democratic National Campaign Committee, Ike McCorkle campaign, Joe Biden/Kamala Harris campaign, Donate to Dems, VoteVets, Pact To The Future, Hillary Clinton Campaign, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), Jason Crowe campaign, Blue Wave, Women’s March on Washington, Service Women’s Action Network (SWAN), Colorado’s Working Families Party, Colorado’s Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call For Moral Revival

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
The summer of 2015 I earned an amazing opportunity from an organization called Service Women Action Network (SWAN), to train as an advocate for servicewomen and women veterans. Today, I am a SWAN fellow, bringing that training back to my VA Medical Center—Rocky Mountain Regional Medical Center Aurora (RMR). I took on an informal volunteer position advocating for veterans receiving their healthcare at RMR. My focus is on the everyday issues and encounters that veterans experience coming through RMR. Some of the concerns I have brought to the attention of staff and administration include: increasing handicap parking spaces and attending to building design inadequacies for disabled access to bathrooms and doors; clearing up clinic appointment backlogs; improving Community Care access when RMR clinics cannot provide services within 30 days; and advocating for better communication between stakeholders and administration. 

In 2017, the Denver VA Medical Center made the big move from 9th street in Denver to East Colfax in Aurora as part of the UC Medical School-Anschutz campus. The opening day was set for the first of August 2017. However, when June came around the Medical Center administration had yet to provided valuable information to veterans who would be most impacted by the move. In all the years of building, waiting, and planning, the administrative staff had not put together an effective and inclusive plan to inform the stakeholders. Many vets coming from the western slopes or neighbor states still did not know the address of the new location. For some local vets, how to get to the new location on public transportation was a concern. And none of us knew what to expect when arriving for an appointment, nor did we know when our clinics would make the move to start the new appointment schedules. When I realized my own anxiety about the move was due to lack of information and no communication, I jumped into action. I approached those responsible for transitioning, pointing out the serious misstep and potential chaos. When no communications on the transition were forth coming by July, I understood that outside pressure needed to be applied. I contacted The Denver Channel’s Contact 7, advising them there was an untold story impacting veterans about the big move. As a result of Contact 7’s coverage, other local news channels did their own stories, reaching out to more veterans. Within a week of the news stories being aired, the Medical Center put up signs, held a townhall, and distributed the transition information we had been waiting on. 

I use my own interactions, concerns, and problems, turn them around and consider who else might be having the same experience. I ask myself; how can I use my voice and platform to bring ease into the lives of others? What skills do I have that can bring about a positive impact? Being an advocate is not easy work. But when I recognize my own encounters can help someone else, I am motivated to do what I can to support, express, write, fight for the best results. For me, the best part of advocacy is listening to the experiences of others and telling those stories to shine a spotlight where there was none. I have the ability to meet people where they are because of the many identities that I inhabit and experiences I gained: in my work as an artist photographer, in my graduate work in U.S. history, and in my work as a sailor, as a woman veteran, and as a LGBTQIA black woman living in Colorado.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The Redistricting Commissions are an innovative, reasoned and orderly method to apply necessary electoral processes in our state, while also providing opportunities to involve the people most impacted by the congressional and legislative district maps. Perhaps the best aspect of the new Redistricting Commissions is the strides taken to add diversity to the table, strides that its composition be representative of the values and needs of all Colorado residents. I believe that having balanced and representative electoral districts not only motivates greater civic engagement, but also better serves our state because of inclusivity. As an African American woman, living in Douglas County, I know how it feels to be excluded from consideration in decisions made by and made for other ethnic, socio-economic, and racial groups. Yet, I do not allow that to diminish who I am, nor do I allow that to influence my confidence that I can contribute to the future of our state in valuable ways.

Colorado has given me—its citizens and tourists—so much as a state rich in outdoor adventures, unparalleled art districts and communities, and innovations in science and business, Being on the Commissions is also a stewardship responsibility. When I was a non-traditional-age student member of Smith College’s Presidential Search Committee, I felt the same responsibility to my fellow students, the alumnae community, the professors, deans, and staff. A week did not go by where someone did not asked me about the progress of the search, or expressed the anticipation for the committee to make a “good choice” for the college. Most importantly, I felt I was a steward of the reputation of Smith College, and all its future endeavors. My participation in the search has a lasting impact. 

Having served 10 years in the military, I learned what it means to be committed to service in the broadest of terms. Becoming a Commission member would allow me to continue to serve a cause greater than myself; and allow me to continue to contribute my experiences and skill sets in a coalition that seeks to empower Colorado’s citizens. If you believe that change and inclusivity are good and necessary, then when opportunities are made available, such as the Redistricting Commissions, you must find ways to participate, to be impactful.

<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
It would be irresponsible of me if I did not acknowledge what our nation has been through in this turbulent and divisive year, during which even public health was politicized. Fairness, impartiality, consensus, and agreement were rarely used to narrow our divides. I support a diverse and inclusive Redistricting Commission as an opportunity for Coloradans to once again exemplify—for the rest of the country—how to come together; how to choose order over chaos; and how to welcome change for the betterment of all. 

There are several times in my life where I have learned the lessons of fairness, impartiality and consensus. For example, I often think of my experience as the only female hospital corpsman on a U.S. Navy ship, whose accompaniment averaged 1100 men and 110 women. In 1983, when women were first assigned to a deployed working naval vessel, our ship was the first test for the new policy. Prior to our arrival, the crew had consisted only of men. Some had been aboard for 6 years when the ship had been assigned a permanent home port in Gaeta, Italy. And most did not want women on board, did not believe a ship was a fitting place for women—whether we wore the same uniform. 

Once we servicewomen came aboard, we quickly realized we had hard work to do overcoming the many obstacles to be respected crew members. I was young, but I learned a lot about gaining respect. By the time I moved on to a new duty station in 1986, the number of women a board had increased to 400. Today, we have women sailors on destroyers, aircraft carriers, submarines, and women captains commanding their own naval vessels. Through the years, I have returned often to the same fundamental lessons I learned aboard that ship.
•	advocate for consensus over conflict to resolve difficult social change
•	approach issues and differing opinions with an open mind 
•	recognize the difference between subjective and objective 
•	gather and review facts where available 
•	facilitate two-way communication, placing equal importance on listening as well as speaking 
•	acknowledge your own biases that they may be put aside for the greater good
•	holdfast to your integrity 
•	understand that compromise is a position of strength 
•	pursue opportunities for unity
•	ask questions 
•	most importantly: being respectful gains respect 
These have been my guiding principles when part of a team, when working on a group project, or in my work advocating for servicewomen and women veterans. They are what I bring to the Commissions.
