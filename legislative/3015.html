        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Stephanie Marie Lindberg</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Stephanie Marie Lindberg
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently employed by two different community colleges, Pikes Peak Community College in Colorado Springs and Arapahoe Community College in Littleton. I am an English composition instructor.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a Bachelor&#39;s degree in journalism and a minor in English from Colorado State University. I have a Master&#39;s degree in Creative Nonfiction Writing from Antioch University - Los Angeles. I also received my Colorado Adult Basic Education Authorization certificate to teach Adult Education and have taught in Adult Education programs or college programs for the last ten years.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80111
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated small amounts of money to some campaigns, including the most current Democratic candidate for president, Joe Biden. I&#39;m pretty sure I made a small donation to Governor Polis&#39;s campaign. I think I also donated to Hillary Clinton&#39;s presidential campaign.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I&#39;m currently on the board of the Colorado Adult Educator Professional Association (CAEPA). I&#39;m also on the citizen advisory board for Colorado State University Extension -- Arapahoe County.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As an adult educator, I have experienced a lot of organizing and advocating for and with my students. Because many people don&#39;t know about what adult education is, I often find myself explaining what it is. It&#39;s important to learn from the people you are representing or advocating for by asking questions and working with them to find solutions, which is what I do as a teacher every day. If I don&#39;t know what the interests or needs of my students are, I&#39;m not able to support them to the best of my ability. Part of what I see as my role in advocating is helping others advocate for themselves, too. I think it&#39;s important to present facts and evidence as part of advocation, too.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I think this process is very important to representation of citizens in Colorado. I like the idea of working with other citizens to come to a consensus after evaluating data and other evidence to construct fair districts. I think I would be a good asset to the commission because of my background in education, and I&#39;m also a critical thinker who loves to dive deep into information and use it to make solid judgements with colleagues. I love working with other people toward common goals.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As I said above, I love working and collaborating with people on common goals. It&#39;s important to me to listen to multiple view points, and as a teacher, I encourage and respect multiple view points. I&#39;m an easy going person and while conflict is uncomfortable, I think it can also lead to better ideas and outcomes. I consider myself a person who can set aside differences and respect other people&#39;s opinions, something I think this commission will need to do to be effective. I like to find common ground with other people and work hard to be equitable and fair to everyone. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a teacher, I&#39;m always using analytic skills and thinking critically. I want every student to be successful, so I use evidence I gather from my past classes to inform improvements in my teaching. Most recently, in my job as an adult educator, I worked with my team of teachers to address test score improvement, attendance, and general support and high impact practices in our program. We used the data and information from our own classrooms and student input to improve our program&#39;s outcomes. This involved a lot of analysis and reasoning, and it was also a long process, but ultimately, we started to see persistence in attendance from one semester to the next and improvement in students&#39; academics. I&#39;m a highly logical person and I enjoy a problem that causes me to stop and really think.
