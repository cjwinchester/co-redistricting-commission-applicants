<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My first political activity was in 1974, when as a 13-year old I volunteered to knock on doors for our local state representative.  I learned some basic lessons in civics, as well as practical lessons in the geography of precincts.  Four years later I was assigned to opposition research duty, revealing a new dimension of campaigns and political activity.  Since then I have volunteered to knock on doors or make phone calls for innumerable candidates and issue campaigns, as well as serving as finance chair for a successful school board candidate.  My most recent volunteer activity was canvassing door-to-door for Senator Michael Bennet in 2018.  
Since 2015, I have made the following political donations:
•	10/15/2016 – Tony Exum, Sr for State Representative
•	12/5/2016 - Jill Gaebler for City Council
•	3/7/2017 - Committee to Elect Richard Skorman
•	6/24/2018 – Tony Exum, Sr. for State Representative
•	10/1/2020 - Tony Exum, Sr. for State Representative
•	10/1/2020 – Diane Mitsch Bush for Congress

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Starting as a newspaper carrier in Dayton, Ohio, I have always tried to stay informed about what happens in my community, reading a little from each paper as I made my way along my delivery route.  My volunteer activities centered around education when my children were school-aged, and more recently have been focused on my church community.  
I served on the State Advisory Committee for Gifted Education for seven years, which advises the State Board of Education on policies and practices to support students identified as gifted and talented, and coordinates with the Colorado General Assembly to implement necessary changes.  The greatest challenge while I was serving was always to find solutions that were effective for school districts with widely divergent populations, areas of service, and resources.  By listening carefully to the perspectives offered by diverse committee members, together we created new standards for identifying students that were based on accessible, objective criteria; the committee helped expand the number of students state-wide for whom services were available without burdening the budgets of rural districts.  I was honored to receive the Parent of the Year award from the Colorado Association for Gifted and Talented in 2009 for this work.
In 2003, four new directors were elected to the Colorado Springs School District 11 Board of Education, running together on a “reform” platform.  Several of these members were openly hostile to the concept of public education and showed little interest in working to improve outcomes and opportunities for students.  This led to a recall campaign, where I participated in recruiting volunteers, gathering signatures, and canvassing community members, resulting in the replacement of two directors in 2006.  This helped stabilize the board and returned the focus to supporting teachers and educating the students in, at the time, the largest district in Colorado Springs.
After retiring from FedEx, I was able to fulfill a long-held desire to contribute in the non-profit sector, taking a position at Envida, an agency dedicated to supporting seniors, Medicaid recipients, and the developmentally disabled by providing transportation and home care service.  As advocates for these communities, Envida has developed relationships with other local transit non-profits to share client data and coordinate rides to improve customer services and increase overall rides provided.  My role as grants project manager requires leadership in bringing both agency executives and transportation managers together to develop and approve operational policies and procedures that are even-handed and support the joint mission.
There are times when the best contribution I can make to support an organization is based on DOING things, such as working with fourth graders in a lunchtime reading group, driving the instrument truck for the high school band or setting up the chairs and stands as part of the stage crew for the youth symphony.  Other situations call for someone who can set the agenda and guide the participants in a meeting, such as the need to address the achievement gap in a school district or plan a capital campaign for a church.  Both skill sets, which I have demonstrated in the volunteer commitments I have undertaken, will be important to achieve the goals of the redistricting commissions.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have long believed that the best government comes from a legislative body that considers a wide range of solutions to the problems that face a community.  At all levels, having a council, commission or legislature that only seriously considers proposals from a narrow political framework rarely produces the best outcomes for the people they represent.  Rather it is in situations where many competing solutions are considered that compromise and consensus lead to effective outcomes.  Yet representation in and of itself is insufficient, unless representatives of both major parties are motivated to seek that compromise and consensus rather than fight for party dominance. 
Creating fair and competitive districts not only empowers citizens, it leads to consideration of more potential solutions for the issues that face us as a society.  It is well documented, and easily observed, that gerrymandered districts that provide “safe” seats for either major party lead to representatives who are driven to more extreme positions within their parties.  While the introduction of open primaries in Colorado was seen as a way to bring more moderates to both sides, the reality is that party candidates continue to be selected based on a narrow set of partisan criteria.
Elected representatives must demonstrate their leadership to their constituents.  I would like to serve on the commission because I believe that fair and competitive districts lead directly to increased accountability, better legislation, and improved outcomes for the people of Colorado.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
An engineering education is not so much about learning specific formulas or techniques as it is learning how to approach a problem and develop a solution.  Working as the manager of an engineering or development team, a project manager, or a business analyst all require similar approaches to solving business problems.  Often when a problem is presented, we want to start throwing out solutions to see how quickly we can overpower it.  In my experience this often leads to solving the wrong thing or addressing surface issues but missing the root cause.  Rather than rush to solutions, one must listen to those who are framing the problem to hear both what is being said and left unsaid.  Developing a clear understanding of root causes requires building trust so that everyone around the table is able both to express their opinion and also to hear what others have to say.  
In my career at FedEx, I had two opportunities to work as an expatriate in Europe.  The second, a three-year assignment from 1996 through 1999 in Brussels, Belgium, was as manager of a group responsible for engineering support and training for invoicing and revenue operations throughout Europe and the Middle East.  Both my staff and my peer managers represented a wide range of cultural norms and expectations.  To be effective, I had to be aware of local practices and balance those with corporate standards and requirements for projects such as the introduction of the Euro currency and global Y2K preparation.  Because I was the American in the room, both groups saw me as outside the assumptions and perceptions of traditional intra-European rivalries.  By maintaining that position as the neutral party, I was able to bridge those cultural differences and build consensus to implement solutions.
For the work of the commissions, understanding the demographic data and geographic constraints on a district are only the first steps to fair elections.  Harder to define, but important to good governance, is to identify and address the concerns of communities of interest.  Like my experience in Brussels, because I have not participated in traditional party structures and leadership, I can view the competing partisan positions from the point of view of an outsider.  I believe that seeking a balance among such communities, while incorporating other traditional redistricting criteria, would drive a representative of either party toward a more cooperative stance in seeking to support the needs of their constituents.  
My experience working with different constituencies in professional, educational, and religious settings is that of someone who seeks to understand and respect the interest of all parties at the table.  I expect to maintain that sense of impartiality and fairness in the service of the redistricting commission.
The 2010 redistricting process, with a split legislature responsible for congressional districts, was  marked by competing rather than cooperative proposals and eventually resolved by having a judge select the districts we have today.  Nevertheless, since those lines were drawn Colorado overall has moved from being roughly balanced between Republicans, Democrats and independent voters to a place where all state-wide offices and both chambers of the legislature are held by Democrats.  It is important to understand that this is not a permanent state of affairs, and that it is possible that such a trend could reverse in the next ten years.  It is therefore critical that the independent redistricting commissions seek to create competitive districts without regard to short-term views to favor current office holders.
