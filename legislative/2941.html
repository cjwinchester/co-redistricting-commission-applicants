<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Eva Henry for Adams County Commissioner, Faith Winter for HD 35, Shannon Bird for HD 35, Cary Kennedy for Governor, Jena Griswold for Secretary of State, Laurie Goldstein for Dist. 12 School Board, Steve O&#39;Dorisio for Adams County Commissioner, Andrew Romanoff for U.S. Senate, Lynn Baca for Adams County Commissioner, Adams County Democratic Party

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I joined the City of Westminster&#39;s Inclusivity Board because I wanted to be able to represent the interests of people living in the more impoverished area of southwest Westminster. I have lived in this area for 37 years and know quite a bit about the Latino population here through my work with Growing Home. I also try to advocate for the needs of the homeless people in this area with whom I became familiar by doing volunteer work with a mobile shower truck once a week during the summer and fall of 2019. I am a member of United for a New Economy (UNE) and helped them with their advocacy efforts to obtain a free legal aid clinic in Adams County. As a member of Growing Home&#39;s Board of Directors and its Advocacy Committee, I participated in speaking in person at City Council, in favor of the development of an affordable housing project in Westminster. I have also submitted my individual comments in favor of a couple of other affordable housing projects in Westminster. I carried a petition and gathered signatures to raise Colorado&#39;s minimum wage to $12 per hour.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I know that the ways that legislative and congressional district boundaries are drawn can have much impact on the types and levels of services that communities can receive. Census figures drive not only elected officials&#39; representation of an area, but also the monetary amounts for services and resources which are so critical to communities, and especially for communities with people of color. Although I am not a person of color myself, I think that I have enough familiarity with the people and types of needs in poorer economic areas, that I can be an effective participant on such a commission. I want to see our state and our communities become more equitable and inclusive for marginalized populations, and I believe that being a part of the redistricting process, I could help make that happen.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe in making decisions based on accomplishing or satisfying a common good that will improve quality of life for everyone. Although I may not be the most talkative person in the group, I do not hesitate to give my opinions and point out my agreement or disagreement with points raised by others. I can effectively summarize points made by several individuals and state areas of agreement. During my many years of work experience as a human resources professional, I always had to conduct programs, selection processes, or disciplinary actions in a fair and impartial manner, so I believe I am able to use that same type of conduct in this situation.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
During my working years, I routinely used analytical skills in researching salary survey information in order to make compensation-related recommendations. I frequently applied logic and reason in dealing with a variety of human resources problems and issues, whether in hiring decisions, or employee complaint or legal situations. Participating on the Adams County Cultural Council required a good deal of analytical skill in reviewing financial grant application information submitted by various organizations requesting SCFD funds. We also made recommendations in how to allocate the available funds to the numerous organizations. As a member of Growing Home&#39;s Board of Directors, I regularly review information related to community needs, how our organization can best provide services and programs to meet those needs, and the subsequent degree of impact that is made.
