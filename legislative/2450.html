In 2020, I donated to Democratic candidates in both the general and primary, and phone-banked during the general.  In 2018, I donated to several Colorado State House and Senate candidates, and hosted a fundraiser at my home for Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, HD59 Representative Barbara MacLachlan, and HD30 Representative Dafna Michaelson Jenet.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe in the mission of the Independent Legislative Redistricting Commission to provide fairly drawn districts for Colorado.  If we desire citizen engagement, then we need everyone, regardless of political party or background, to feel a sense of fairness and belonging.  All parts of this state need to be confident they and the community they&#39;ve built around them have the same chance to be heard as any other community.  I&#39;ve experience a number of the varied voices around Colorado.  I live in a vibrant, politically active part of Denver today, but was raised in Gunnison on the western slope, an equally vibrant but quite different perspective.  As a real estate attorney practicing for the last 15 years in Colorado, not a day goes by where I&#39;m not talking to someone in a different location in Colorado about issues unique to that piece of the state.  I also come to the project with a lifelong interest in questions of citizenship.  While earning a master&#39;s degree in political philosophy, I taught courses about the philosophical underpinnings of governments, particularly American self-governance.  While a practicing attorney, I have taught the Philosophy of Law course to undergraduates at CU-Denver, taking them through the organizational framework of our constitutional system.  I would be incredibly humbled and thrilled to contribute to Colorado&#39;s self-governance through work on the Commission.    
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My day to day work amounts to helping people with opposing interests find agreement around complicated issues.  Although I went to law school with visions of Atticus Finch or Perry Mason in my head, I learned quickly that the combative side of attorney work did not suit my temperament.  Instead, I prefer the process of listening to parties and helping them sharpen their own perspectives in ways that allow them to find common ground with others they didn&#39;t see at first glance.  I&#39;ve found my strength lies in working the puzzle pieces until they fit.  As an attorney, I&#39;m well versed with and committed to ethical rules of professional conduct.  I believe they are absolute lynchpins.  In the political process, I have in the past served as an election judge in Colorado where you are asked to provide immediate fair and impartial guidance to voters.  If on the Commission, I would hold myself and my fellow Commissioners to the highest ethical standards.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
An early mentor in my legal career once explained to me that contracts are essentially decision trees.  I teach on behalf of the CBA the annual course on commercial leasing to other Colorado attorneys.  In that course, I encourage attorneys to think of a multi-year commercial lease as effectively the reference guide for how people likely not then at the table will handle all the issues and changes that arise in the future.  That requires pausing to focus on unforeseen events or unintended consequences, and laying out the steps to be taken in a way that will make sense to a future reader.  That&#39;s what the Commission should strive to do.  In other words, the logic of the final maps should be as clear in year 10 as they are in year 1.
