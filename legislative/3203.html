<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
For the past forty years, I have been active in multiple realtor and home building associations throughout Colorado.  I have played a vital role in both organizations, including a five-year commitment to the Colorado Association of Homebuilder&#39;s leadership, where I served as president of that organization in 2012.  I have participated in the government affairs committees for the homebuilders and realtor associations. I have testified on their behalf on multiple issues before the state legislature and the US House of Representatives. As a real estate broker, I have hired and trained hundreds of agents and rebuilt declining offices for brand known real estate brokerages. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to participate in the commission because Colorado can do better.  For too long, we have allowed the process of re-districting to be partisan as opposed to what is best for Coloradans. I am a republican, but I love my state and know that this commission has the opportunity to create districts that will be more accountable to the people of Colorado.  Of course, I would like to see more republicans win statewide, but that also begins by requiring them to run better candidates. We should not reward either party a slam dunk district when we do the district&#39;s people lose. When we put party above the people&#39;s interest, we get districts where they are so partisan that one party doesn&#39;t run a candidate. This leads to no vigorous debate or exchanging ideas in the district, just merely a safe seat. Non-competitive districts do not allow the people to hold their representatives accountable for their actions.  Districts should be drawn in a fashion that encourages debate and requires the representative to stand before the state&#39;s people every two to four years to be held accountable for their actions. This committee has the opportunity to see that districts are created in the best interest of the people of Colorado and not in the best interest of one party or the other. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>


I have spent forty years negotiating real estate transactions and development projects with municipalities.  None of these transactions occur without consensus. It would be unrealistic to believe that anyone sitting on the commission would not be a strong advocate for their position; however, every negotiation requires the ability to separate emotions or personal preferences to achieve a final resolution.  I have demonstrated over the last four decades the ability to negotiate and resolve thousands of transactions.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
One of the most vital aptitudes I have is to take complex problems and final solutions. To achieve a final disposition in real estate or development, you must work through a series of problems.  For example, your project has a water issue related to flooding, as designated by Fema&#39;s published maps. Your challenge in developing the project is that you must bring your property outside the flood plain, but you may not negatively impact your neighbors. These are the day-to-day operational problems surrounding development and real estate transactions, and you must apply reasoned solutions to achieve a final product or transaction.
