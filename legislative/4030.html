<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been politically active and engaged since at least 2000, when I was just out of college and my roommate and I volunteered to assist former Sen. Bill Bradley’s campaign for President. We didn’t know what we were doing and probably weren’t all that helpful, but we wanted to be involved. In 2002 and 2004, I worked on campaigns for candidates for State Representative and District Attorney. I was a candidate for public office myself in 2008, when I won the Democratic nomination for the Jefferson County Board of County Commissioners (District 2). 

To the best of my recollection, I have donated money to the following candidates/organizations:

Jeff Bridges for State Representative
Mike Weissman for State Representative
Jefferson County Democratic Party
George Stern for Jefferson County Clerk
Brittany Pettersen for State Senate
David Ortiz for State Representative
Andy Kerr for Jefferson County Commissioner
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have been active in my community in a variety of roles for more than 20 years. In the interest of sanity, I reduced much of my community engagement activities by the time my children were all old enough to be in school; for the purposes of this application I went back a few more years in listing organizations/associations.

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I am a fourth-generation Coloradan, a husband, a son, a brother, and a father of three children; as such, I view advocacy and contributing to the community to be a moral obligation as much as a personal choice. I have taken a particularly active role in issues regarding education, youth development, and after school activities (as evidenced by my leadership roles with the PTA, Second Wind Fund, and Denver SCORES). 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Fair and equal representation is at the very heart of our political system. This is a principle that I take very seriously. I would be proud to be part of a commission that seeks to ensure that all Coloradans are equitably represented by its elected officials. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am a Democrat who generally supports Democratic causes and issues. I don’t pretend not to have partisan leanings, but I believe that transparency is important if you hope to reach an impartial decision on any issue. Consensus comes from understanding and accepting different viewpoints, beginning with an honest discussion and a common goal of fairness. 

In terms of fairness and impartiality, I will always approach any discussion with an unshakable belief in facts -- from demographics and population numbers to geographic boundaries and landmarks. Factual information cannot be changed in order to support a different opinion. My mother was a journalist for her entire career, and I followed her in that profession for the first 10 years of my working life. It was always important to me to ensure the accuracy of my reporting and writing regardless of any particular perspective. I would do the same thing as a member of this commission. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
During my career as a journalist, I learned that there are always multiple competing sides to any story -- but there are rarely competing sets of facts. Every decision or perspective should start from a foundation of objectively-true information. This approach has always served me well; if it can help me tackle a problem with strong-minded individuals on the Jefferson County Council PTA, it should be equally effective on the commission. 

While I would endeavor to ensure an educated and engaging discussion on the commission, I would be a strong voice for keeping the group focused on the ultimate goal of meeting deadlines for redistricting. The importance of immovable deadlines was drilled into me throughout my career; if I missed my deadline for publication or going on-air, it would cause a ripple effect for everyone else in the organization.
