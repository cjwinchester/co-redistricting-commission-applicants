<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I feel that I have reached a point in my life where my commitments to my children and family have freed me up now to be able to devote time and give back to my community. I thought I had reached this point in 2016 when my youngest son graduated high school and was heading to Cal Poly for college but the injury, he suffered altered everything. He suffered a C-5/C-6 cervical neck fracture and is now quadriplegic. This injury changed everything for our entire family. His perseverance has pushed him forward and he is now in his senior year at CU Boulder and he has progressed immensely in developing his independence. There are still many challenges for him and my wife and I but I feel that I’m now able to look beyond the world we’ve had to adapt to over these last four years. The challenges we’ve faced have ranged from medical emergencies, to adapting living spaces, navigating government services, and providing reassurances when none seemed possible, all the while maintaining a dental practice that allows me to provide the income needed to overcome the many financial burdens. I’ve needed to juggle so many competing challenges that have made me more pragmatic and empathetic to issues we all must face.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In past years I&#39;ve donated to both Republicans and Democrats but since 2015 I have donated only to Democrats including Joe Biden, John Hickenlooper, Jaime Harrison, Jon Ossoff and Amy McGrath. I come from a staunch Republican family from NH but have found the past four years to have been disappointing for Republicans and wish to try to affect real change.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Due to family commitments over the past 4 years I have had little time to volunteer to any organizations outside of career associated groups. My son experienced a cervical neck fracture shortly after graduating from high school in 2016 that left him in a wheelchair and quadriplegic. These last four years have been a challenge for our family, and I have devoted all my free time towards helping him achieve the goal of going to CU Boulder and completing college.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I feel our biggest political problem in this country is the Gerrymandering of congressional districts. A two-party political system with noncompetitive districts means primaries become too polarized. Candidates only must compete with a staunch base and not have to compete with the general population. That leads to a polarized legislative body unwilling to compromise with the opposing party. Scott Tipton was an effective, conservative representative for the 3rd District of Colorado but the hard-core base that shows up for primaries elected what I consider a &quot;fringe&quot; candidate. This has made the traditionally very conservative 3rd district competitive for Democrats. It should not take a &quot;fringe&quot; candidate&#39;s election in a primary to make a district competitive. They should always be competitive between the two parties they represent.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I feel I am a pragmatic, empathetic, practical person always willing to look at issues from differing perspectives. I have built two dental offices over the course of my career, the first involved four dentists with separate practices moving into one common space and the second involving myself and one other practice. Getting us all to agree on certain decisions was always a challenge and I feel I have always been the one most readily to compromise and provide solutions in order to achieve the goal of moving forward and completing the projects.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My undergraduate degree was Chemistry and prior to attending Dental School I worked for 3 years as an environmental engineer. I look at any issue I am faced with through the lens of science and math. I try to learn as much as I can about any issues I am presented with from as many differing perspectives as I can find and then make informed, calculated decisions as best as I can. I feel my contribution to this commission would be to bring that same mindset to the decisions that these commissions would be responsible to make.
