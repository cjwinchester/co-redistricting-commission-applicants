<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In November, 2017, I was appointed to the board of directors for the Tallyn’s Reach Metro District #3 and officially started my first elected term in May, 2018.  As a board, we are responsible for collecting property taxes from property owners within the district, as well as annual fees.  These funds are dedicated to the payment of bonds and the operating costs for maintaining the community.  My contributions to the discussions and the efforts of the board have resulted in improved landscaping, property management representation, and reduced taxes through refinancing and accelerated payment of bonds.  Our focus is on representing the citizens and making strategic decisions for the future.
I’ve had a variety of experience in the creation of local and state-wide policies and legislation through the adoption of fire codes, testimony to state legislators regarding proposed legislation, and activities related to fire district merger elections through preparation of election materials, presentations to citizens, testimony in response to a lawsuit, and assistance with the implementation of the elections.  I’ve participated in state associations’ legislative committees including Colorado State Fire Chief, Special District Association, and Fire Marshal’s Association of Colorado.  I was also asked to bring stakeholders together to provide input to the sunset of the (former) Colorado Division of Fire Safety on behalf of the Fire Marshal’s Association of Colorado.
During the 2020 presidential election, I served as a ballot security election judge for Arapahoe County on November 3, 2020 where I was assigned to a bipartisan team to retrieve ballots from ballot boxes and polling centers and return them for processing.

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
There have been several opportunities over the past decade where I’ve had the opportunity and challenge of bringing stakeholders together in order to work toward a community-oriented goal.  In recent years, South Metro Fire Rescue has merged with neighboring fire districts in order to improve service, safety, and long-term stability.  My role was to help perform the analysis to justify the mergers, work toward the buy-in of the political entities, negotiate contracts, educate the citizens, and address stakeholder concerns.  Since the mergers, I have been responsible for working with our GIS staff and board of directors to draw director district boundaries that consider input into community representation while complying with state laws and constitutional provisions.
As an elected member of a metro district board of directors, our first priority is to provide the representation necessary for the taxpayers, hear their concerns, and maintain their pride in the community.
My efforts to organize a state-wide coalition for home fire sprinklers in 2009, required me to gain the buy-in of other building and fire code officials in the state including those that were in opposition to the effort.  Then, for a decade I helped keep stakeholders engaged and focused on the shared goals of the coalition.  Similarly, I’ve had several years of opportunities to bring together stakeholders and represent them at the local, state and national levels for the creation of fire and building codes.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I’m very honored to be considered to serve on the commission.  The voters have asked for a more transparent and nonpartisan system of creating districts that avoids many of the pitfalls of the past and I embrace these expectations.  And, this is an opportunity for me to take personal responsibility to ensure the success of this new effort.  I know that my education, experience, values, and natural abilities align well with the desired characteristics of commission members.  I’ve also shown how I’m willing to get involved with community, regional, and state-wide efforts for the greater good.  I hope I am chosen to serve on this commission to make a difference in Colorado.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I’ve often been described as someone with strong listening skills, a calm demeanor, and the ability to process through the many different points of view and emotions of a group in order to steer the discussion to a strategy that is logical, fair, impartial, and has buy-in.  These qualities have driven how I have shown up when serving on jury duty, the state electrical board, the metro district board, the fire district executive team, and many other situations.
One example of my success in promoting consensus is during my leadership of the Colorado Fire Sprinkler Coalition.  I worked with the Home Builder’s Association who was officially opposed to home fire sprinklers but ended up being one of the best participants in our coalition and we found a strategy that we both could stand behind.  They even provided testimony to city councils in support of that strategy.  Another example was seen in 2015/2016 when I was asked to help bring together the Fire Marshal’s and Building Officials of Douglas County to work toward compromise to successfully adopt a fire code that addressed stakeholder goals and eased tensions between the building and fire representatives.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In addition to my mathematical and engineering degrees and background, my Emergenetics® profile shows that I have natural tendencies and strengths in analytical and structural thinking, which indicates a preference for logical, rational, and data-driven problem solving.  For the past several years, my job includes working with technical staff that produce the data for me and other leaders to identify areas for improvement, develop strategies, and present recommendations to a wide variety of audiences.  Examples include evaluating fire district mergers, determining fire station locations, re-drawing board member districts, and analyzing emergency response times.  Two awards for research papers I’ve authored are good indications of these strengths.  I am often relied on to contribute a calm, logical approach to discussions while respecting the passion and emotions behind the topics and the impact of our decisions on our citizens.
