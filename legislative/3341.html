<h3>Background</h3>

<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>

Served as a precinct committee person and chairman for Otero County Democrat Party. Served as Secretary and Chairman for 3rd Congressional District Committee. Elected to Colorado State Senate four times (1983-1998). Served on the Colorado Joint Budget Committee for twelve years (1987-1998). Appointed by Governor Bill Owens (1999) and confirmed by the Colorado State Senate to serve as a cabinet member to the governor as Director of Health Care Policy and Finance Department. Appointed by President Barak Obama as the Federal Representative/Chairman of the Colorado/Kansas Arkansas River Compact. Served on a number of state task forces over the years including: Task force on Reorganization of Community Colleges (appointed by Governor Bill Owens), Task Force on Connect Colorado (appointed by Governor Bill Owens), Task Force on Economic Development and Small Business (appointed by Governor Bill Ritter), and served on Governor Elect John Hickenlooper&#39;s Transition Team. 
Since November 10,2015, I attended fund raisers for both democrat and republican candidates for local offices. I also attended and donated to both the Otero County Democrat and Republican Parties (these donations were through attendance at Jefferson/Jackson/Kennedy and Lincoln Day dinners/auctions. Until this year I had not donated to any state-wide or national candidate. This year (2020) I donated to the Joe Biden for President Committee and the Lincoln Project.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have served on the following boards/commissions: Chairman and member of Head Start Program (San Luis and Arkansas Valley), Koshare Indian Museum/Dancers, SEBREA Board, Colorado Community College President&#39;s Council, Federal Representative and Chairman Colorado/Kansas Arkansas River Compact Commission, Southeast Colorado Workforce Board, Colorado Rural Consortium of Workforce Board, La Junta Chamber of Commerce Community Service Committee, and the Southern Colorado Foundation Board.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I represented ten counties in southern Colorado as a State Senator for sixteen years. During that time I introduced and was prime sponsor of over 323 pieces of legislation. Legislation included: Rural/Urban Economic Development, Enterprise Zones, Rural/Urban Venture Capital Financing, Medicaid reform, Reorganization of Health Care/Human Services in Colorado, Water and Private Property Rights legislation, Agriculture Expansion, Property and Income Tax Legislation, Reorganization of Higher Education, Juvenile Detention Reform, School Finance (K-12), Siting of State Prisons and Expansion of Private Prisons in the state, Preservation of Rail System from Western Slope to the Kansas Border, Workers Compensation Reform, Rural Health Care Expansion and development of twelve state budgets as a member of the six member Joint Budget Committee. In all of these endeavors I met with all interest groups to listen to their views so as to eventually move toward developing a consensus so as to pass the legislation or budget. To finalize the state budget the six members (majority and minority party members) had to develop and consensus and unanimous vote in order to close the budget legislation. I met with individuals and organizations from throughout the state of Colorado thus getting to know the concerns or issues of urban, rural, western slope, eastern slope, northern and southern Colorado.
As a member of Governor Bill Owen&#39;s cabinet (Director of Health Care Policy and Finance) I was responsible for meeting with and bringing together different health care organizations (Hospitals, Rural Health Care, Nursing Homes, Disability Community and Medicaid constituents) so as to propose legislation, develop rules and regulations and propose a budget to meet the needs of the health care community (both providers and users) while at the same time ensuring that a balanced budget was being proposed. To ensure input from throughout the state I initiated the policy of holding the Medicaid Board meetings throughout the state of Colorado rather than just holding the meetings in Denver. This initiative gave individuals, organizations and constituency groups better access and input into the Medicaid Boards development of rules and regulations.
While serving as President of Otero Jr. College I was asked by the President and State Board for the Colorado Community College System to be on a five member task force meet with community members in northwest Colorado to help reorganize and draft a plan to ensure the continued viability and sustainability of Northwest Colorado Community College in Rangely/Craig Colorado. As a member of the task force we met with community members, stakeholders and other constituency groups to ensure we as a task force developed a plan that would meet the needs of the people served by Northwest Colorado Community College. Through our meetings a consensus was developed and the plan submitted to the State Board for Community Colleges was accepted.
I was asked in 2006 while serving as President of Otero Jr. College to become the joint President of both Otero Jr. College and Lamar Community College. I served in this position for two and one half years and met with community members, students, stakeholders and other constituency groups to listen to their concerns, gain their trust and ultimately develop stability at Lamar Community College both in terms of a sustained plan for program develop and financial stability. This was one of the most challenging positions I have held in that there is inherent distrust when a larger college (Otero Jr. College) is responsible for the management of a smaller college. There were fears of consolidation, closure etc. associated with this move by the System office. By listening and working with everyone I was able to develop and plan which ensured Lamar Community College&#39;s to continue as a stand alone institution. The Colorado State Board for Community Colleges adopted the plan submitted and Lamar Community College hired its own President and continues to be financially and academically viable and sustainable to this day.
In other boards I have served on I have maintained my same sense of mission to listen and develop workable plans of action to meet the needs of an area or region of the state and the constituencies served. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to ensure that legislative districts are representative of the people they serve rather than serve the needs of political parties. I have seen over the course of my career that districts are typically drawn to meet the desires of incumbents or gerrymandered to ensure political control in the state legislature. I feel I know the state of Colorado, its demographic differences and am willing to meet with the people throughout the state to come up with districts that are reflective of the interests of the people served.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have always worked to address issues rather than promote politics during the course of my career. Some of the examples stated in my application show that I believe in a team approach whether in be in the legislature, a member of the Joint Budget Committee, as a minority member of Governor Owen&#39;s Cabinet, or as a community member serving on different boards and President of a Community College(s). I sincerely believe that people see me as a goal (solve the problem) leader rather than a partisan. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am very detailed oriented. I am very good with numbers and have a keen sense of the demographic differences throughout the state. I am not a partisan and recognize that this commission was established by the people to come up with representative districts that are representative of the people served rather than political parties and special interest groups.
