<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that redistricting is a much understood &amp; appreciated process. Too often it is not organized to serve an economic &amp; social community, usually geographic in nature.  This is a fresh opportunity to organize a new process: that process will be (good or bad -- hopefully overwhelming fair) the basis for the next group -- 10 years from now. It is important to create a fundamental process that can be built upon. In any case, the following 10 years of elections will depend on it being more fair than the past to the Citizens of Colorado.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Most of my life I have been in repair in one field or another, the past few years in a new career field running my own business. In all cases this has meant learning, researching, brainstorming, and creating processes.  Almost always on a team (at least for significant issues).  Considering a large list of inputs, then whittling them down by the conditions to the best or most likely results.  Everyone wants to contribute -- it&#39;s voluntary to even be on the committee. And everyone has something of value to contribute. Some will contribute ideas, some will contribute by asking hard questions or requiring accurate data.  Others simply by putting together data.  Even those that aren&#39;t in agreement force the rest to confirm their reasons for a decision.  Being fair is usually as simple as being polite -- let the other person have a say, wait for your turn, etc.  Being impartial shouldn&#39;t be an issue for anyone on the committee -- leave it at the door; this is a job as much as it is a civic responsibility.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My past career &amp; education was overwhelmingly in science and technology. Starting in electronics, communications/rf, systems engineer &amp; repair,  leading to networking, and computer repair. In all cases solutions to problems had to fit the conditions -- you can&#39;t fake data to solve a problem.  Research often solved problems (similar problems, or seemingly similar problems often lead to accurate answers).  Sometimes you found out that you didn&#39;t have enough information; I couldn&#39;t be afraid to ask for additional resources when potential solutions didn&#39;t work, or results didn&#39;t meet expectations.  In other words, sometimes you have to start over, as the apparent scope of the problem didn&#39;t fit the results.  It happened occasionally -- let your customer know that a problem remained unresolved and add additional resources to the data gathering (where often information about prior work changed the resulting efforts).   As well as add additional 3rd party technical expertise (more finite analysis of the symptoms).    With my business it isn&#39;t much different.  If a customer wants some work done I am not particularly familiar with, I research the request:  process, materials, tooling, time required, ability to master the techniques in a timely matter; will it be financially worth it to do the work (do I expect to do it again, not make as much margin; will the first customer be willing to pay enough to do the work, etc).  If it&#39;s a small enough part of a job, do I take a loss for the work in the rest of the project?  Do I know someone better suited for the work?  Do I want to do the work?
