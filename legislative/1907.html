        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Stuart Neal Allen</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Stuart Neal Allen
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Senior Software Test Engineer - Lockheed Martin Corporation
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  1981 - Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science - State University of New York @ Oswego
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81201
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I&#39;m not a political organizer by nature but serving as the Treasurer for both a Square Dance Club and an HOA in my past really allows you realize how an organization that seems straight-forward in its goals is comprised of so many people with different goals! Dealing with money issues as a treasurer forces you to balance the emotional feeling money (and politics) can impair or passionate people which can affect their reasoning skills. This commission would be an extension of that by treating &quot;groups of people (such as Democrats or Republicans)&quot; in a similar way as you would have to juggle individual people and viewpoints. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
None. I consider that an advantage of starting with a clean slate and not having preconceived ideas of how the state should be apportioned.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I&#39;ve been an active member of multiple Square dance clubs in the Denver Metro area and served as Treasurer and board member for one of the clubs. I&#39;m a member of multiple volunteer groups like the Colorado Trail Foundation, Colorado 14&#39;ers Institute and Continental Divide Trail Coalition. A year ago I moved to Salida to live part-time while I finished my last year of work in Littleton. With the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been a challenge to get to know my new community fully with so many groups shut down but I have already participated in the local food banks and homestead &quot;Farm to Table&quot; organizations. In 2021 I will be &quot;retired&quot; in Salida full-time and look forward to much more involvement when the pandemic restrictions are lifted. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I look at the current districts and often wonder - &quot;How in the heck did anyone come up with that map?&quot; Living in the same spot in the suburbs of Denver during a 17 year span resulted in me being placed in three different U.S. House Districts. Some of my neighbors two miles away would be in a different district which made no sense to me. I like to think of Colorado as a giant puzzle made up of 64 counties - or Mountainous or Plains - or Urban Rural, Suburban - or ... and it becomes obvious that coming up with districts that make sense, are fair, and take into account such a variety of factors - is an extreme challenge and it would be fun to solve that puzzle. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have traveled though nearly every county and major town in Colorado so I think I can relate to the viewpoints of people who live in the wide variety of places in this state. I&#39;ve served as jury foreman on multiple jury trials where fairness and impartiality are of the utmost importance. &quot;Get the data, brainstorm, listen to others, and come up with the best solution&quot; has been a normal way of life in my entire career. Having twelve people of different political viewpoints will force us to have to come up with sound solutions that are not secretly based on &quot;This will help my political party&quot;. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
For my 38 year career, I&#39;ve been a software Engineer doing coding, testing and design of complicated software that runs and monitors spacecraft designed here in Colorado. For the most recent 10 years of my career I primarily have designed automated software tests that test application and system software that others have written to verify that on a spacecraft it will perform flawlessly. Even a very minor mistake can result in the lost of the functionality of a spacecraft that costs 100&#39;s of millions of dollars to build, launch and operate. Using logic and analytical skills are my two strongest traits. For engineers, it can be very difficult to use that approach with others and have the ability to understand the intuitive and emotional nature of people which you have to consider to really understand the problem and come up with the best solutions that may at first not seem like the most logical.
