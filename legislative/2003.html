<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I volunteer in online communities to help (women primarily) connect with like-minded individuals working for social justice: to engage in advocating for the rights of homeless, hungry, LGBTQI+, low-income communities’ access to clean air and water, and racial and ethnic communities under-served in especially educational settings. 

In my religious denomination, I advocate for the full inclusion of LGBTQI+ persons, and over the last 5 years have sewn over 500 rainbow stoles for church members to wear as a symbol of full inclusion.

</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My political activity has been in service to campaigns and issues that revolved around improving social justice. I have volunteered for local, regional, and state-wide campaigns where candidates’ goals and integrity matched my expectations. During the last 5 years, I donated to these and other campaigns, particularly campaigns of women and members of marginalized racial, ethnic, and gender-identity communities.

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am active in my county party as a volunteer and in Arvadans for Progressive Action (a nonpartisan) community group devoted to social justice. In addition, I am a member of the Arvada Chorale, have sung with both the Spirituals Project (a group dedicated to preserving and teaching about Negro Spirituals) and the Denver Gay Men’s Chorus, and am a member of the Chancel Choir at my church. I attend Lukas Elementary School PTA meetings (where a grand-daughter attends) and volunteer at a community Arts Camp as a costume designer and seamstress. I was appointed to serve on the Jeffco Schools: School Safety Task Force. 

Most of my other community volunteer work is done outside of “organizations.” I am a sustaining contributor to The NOAH Project (homeless services in Detroit MI), to The Table (Arvada community food bank), and participate in meal service at The Rising and The Delores Project  (homeless food services). In addition, I sew about 250 fleece hats for the homeless annually, produce fleece blankets for homeless and lower-income families and, during the early days of the pandemic, I was able to sew (and donate) about 900 quilter’s-cotton masks for food banks, women’s shelters, and homeless food services, and for essential workers.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My reasons for applying to serve on the Redistricting Commission revolved around my desire to make political life in our society more just for all Coloradans. Though I am today well-educated and economically comfortable, I grew up in agrarian circumstances where I expected to be neither. As is the case for many from less fortunate childhoods, especially those plagued with violence at home, finding a better life and making life better for others cannot be disentangled. I grew up in rural circumstances in Oklahoma and Texas never expecting to attend higher education, then accepted an opportunity to study engineering Colorado. Education served as my steppingstone to a better life. I was very fortunate to arrive at Colorado School of Mines understanding the virtues of hard work and persistence. I am, thus, especially well-trained in mathematics and the sciences, and was the 21st woman graduate of Mines, with a degree in Geologic Engineering, providing unique experiences about being a member of an under-represented group. Though women were seldom hired for engineering jobs at the time, the Arab oil embargo made any engineer who could work in the petroleum industry desirous, even women. I worked in petroleum engineering (monitoring oil reservoirs and production) for 15 years: in a field office in very rural NM, in a research center in Littleton, CO, and at a regional bank in an energy lending group. In each, I was the sole woman engineer and know the isolation of being under-represented. Along the way, I completed graduate coursework in Applied Mathematics. 

I left engineering and retrained in education to address my life-long goal of making life better for others. I studied philosophy for a year to think about my goals. Since education had provided my opportunities, I decided to give back in this area. But since my worldview was narrow and specific to my circumstances, I needed to better understand the views of others unlike myself, as well as come to deeper understandings about life in a democracy and how education served democracy’s aims. I became a certified teacher of secondary mathematics in CO and earned a master’s in Math Education, then entered a doctoral program in foundations of education (the area where I could learn about education in a democracy). My goal was to become a professor and to teach on a campus educating under-served graduate students. I earned my PhD in Boulder and after a short time on the itinerant-faculty circuit landed my dream job in Detroit at Wayne State University, a Research-1 University serving Black, recent immigrant, and lower-income students. Thus, I spent the last 15 years of my work life serving these students, in particular guiding 26 of them through the doctorate and into leadership positions in their communities. Preparing new leaders is central to the aims of social justice in a democracy, which in the US has focused on equity in education, economic well-being through employment, and enfranchisement. Redistricting is part and parcel of how political structures enact long-standing ideals of our democracy, and I possess skills relevant to the Commission.

My two areas of academic expertise, research methods and social justice in education, contribute to my qualifications for the commission. My mathematical skills, background in geologic engineering, and abilities to manage both quantitative and qualitative information relate directly to the need of the Commission to understand complex data sets and their impacts on diverse people arrayed across Colorado. My expertise in social justice, my academic preparation coupled with my experiences living and working in both urban, suburban, and rural locales with socioeconomic-, racial-, ethnic-, and language-diverse people, provide me with unusual vantage points on the histories of injustice and misrepresentation in the US. These experiences also help me understand the need for justice through fair elections, and help me see not just my own needs, interests, and desires, but also seek to understand and to advocate for the needs, interests, and desires of those least likely to be included in making decisions that impact their lives. Granted I can never directly experience the discrimination felt by many in our society, but I have tried to become more knowledgeable about their circumstances. 

Fair election maps provide an avenue for ensuring that each person is included in political decision-making that influences their lives, the lives of those they care about and of those whose experiences they share. Election maps, when fair, encode our society’s promise that democracy be founded on mutual respect for one another, and on a commitment to participation that springs from thoughtful consideration of important issues impacting everyday lives. My engineering studies and career were underpinned by maps in every setting; in fact, geologic maps represent complex data displayed geographically. 

Thus, serving on the redistricting commission represents an additional way I might contribute to improving the lives of others. I seldom seek out “committee” work in my retirement, but agree to such service when my expertise is well matched to committee/commission goals. As my CV demonstrates, I have a long track record of committee work in my profession(s). In engineering work, teams of differently qualified experts and inter-corporate committees served as the primary way to share technical information and reach consensus on decisions where there were competing interests. At universities, faculty committees guide the institution. In fact, at WSU, shared decision-making was an integral part of the faculty union contract with the Administration, and faculty members took these responsibilities seriously. In addition, I served for over 12 years on the University’s Institutional Review Board. This Board protected diverse research participants’ rights (as I explain further in a subsequent section of this application).

In my community, I am active in a community chorale, a large church, and regularly contribute to food banks and serving homeless meals. I also participate in homeless services in urban settings. These activities provide insights into the wider communities where I have lived.

Thus, I am highly qualified for the task at hand, with my background in mathematics, geology (which in large part is a deeper dive into maps representing complex data displayed geographically), and in social justice scholarship, as well as by my persistent engagement in my profession with others who come from diverse circumstances. Throughout my career, I have worked primarily in settings where group (teamwork) decision-making was the norm. For myself, I have lived experiences with being poor, being hungry, and being the only person like myself in teamwork, offices, and large corporate settings.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Collaborative decision-making, and consensus building, has been central to my committee work, and used both empathy and mutual respect for others. As to empathy, in engineering I was considered a “bleeding heart,” someone who incorporated empathy into routine engineering and corporate decisions. But an example from everyday life exemplifies how empathy is a core part of my character. One dark night as I drove home to Lakewood from late classes in Boulder, I encountered a car north of Golden with its flashers on. Of course, being from the country, I stopped to render aid. A first-language Spanish-speaking family was trying to reach the Jeffco jail where a family member was being released. I gave one of the adults a ride into Golden to connect with this family member. At the jail, the family member was repeatedly rebuffed by the clerical person on duty, who said,  “What? I can’t understand you. Can’t you speak English?” The family member was speaking English and I understood her. With the family member’s permission, I stepped in, introduced myself, and repeated what they had been saying. Only then did the clerical staff act as if they understood and the jailed person was released. I was very embarrassed for Jeffco, and ashamed of my community for being so callous. It was empathy that required me to stop and empathy that led to my providing a ride into Golden. But my shame and embarrassment came from my seeming to be (albeit unwittingly) a participant in this sort of callous treatment of members of marginalized communities in our society. This experience deepened my empathy for those who suffer persistent slights and insults in our society.

As to mutual respect of others, I held a wide range of leadership positions where I treated others with respect despite differing opinions. Engineering ethics requires that engineers recognize the limits of their own expertise and respect the expertise of others, and the same holds among the professoriate. Engineers work hard to get things right, which requires gathering information of both a technical and social nature. That is, like the commission&#39;s work, engineering problem-solving routinely situates technical issues within a real-world of people with diverse interests. Engineering work routinely influences the lives of others and engineers cannot pretend otherwise, requiring that these contextualizing situations be understood from the perspective of everyday folks impacted by decisions. In addition, as a professor, I served for over 12 years on one Committee of the University’s Institutional Review Board. Committees included faculty and community members, who guaranteed that every research proposal respected the rights to informed consent of every research participant. Faculty members of the committee spanned the University Schools and Colleges, and each faculty member served because they represented one sort of academic expertise. Research participants came from Detroit MI, a very diverse urban center in the US, as well as from third-world countries around the globe. Members of this committee were trained in, and guided by, community (cultural) expectations for lower-income residents, for Black Americans, for Middle Eastern Americans from diverse national heritages, for diverse indigenous communities, for diverse sub-communities within the LGBTQI+ community, and for recent and long-term immigrants from Central and South American, Middle Eastern, Eastern European (Balkan), and south and eastern Asian countries. I thus have deep training about diverse persons, their cultural practices, and the protection of their rights. Impartiality in both engineering and academic collaborative decision-making came from requiring that stakeholders be included, that their concerns be addressed, and their advice be followed, and fairness emerged through operational structures that encouraged, instead of blunted, participation. 

Taken together my childhood roots in settings quite unlike my adult situation, my educational preparation, and my work and life experiences as an adult provide me with especially well-informed vantage points on life in the US.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In both my engineering, academic career, and home life; logic, analytic skills and problem-solving have been central to my practices. Clearly, engineering and academic work overwhelmingly depend on mathematical science underpinned by logical decisions. I have for the last 50 years worked with maps and with large data sets of both quantitative and qualitative information, upon which decisions rested. As an engineer, I worked in 3 diverse settings, all of which depended on understanding how numbers represent the world around us, and how decisions I was in volved in making impact the lives of others. In the last of these I was the Senior Reservoir Engineer in a large state bank’s energy lending group, and the only engineer employed in the holding company. Here, I worked with technical and financial data to ascertain to what extent given oil production revenue streams might support loans. In fact, I held this position on Black Sunday, May 2, 1982, the day Exxon walked away from their holdings in the Piceance Basin, devastating Colorado’s Western Slope. My role at the bank required my participation in top-level meetings to ensure the bank not only met all guidelines for lending and asset management, but also supported long-time customers whose economic circumstances had changed overnight. I have also served on university-wide and college budget committees responsible for monitoring and advising administrations about budgetary matters during the recession of 2007, which was especially deep in Michigan. As happened in Colorado, significant changes in University and College operations followed, with reductions in faculty lines, shifts in enrollment, and changes in degrees and certificates offered.

In both careers, creative analysis proved central to workplace activities. All engineering decisions depend on strategic planning, optimizing production, collaboration between engineering and field staff, and creative brainstorming to find workable solutions to difficult problems. This is no less true of a faculty member’s responsibilities on a campus where the faculty are central to decisions about a College and University’s future given exigent circumstances. In both engineering and academia, industry downturns and state reductions in campus revenues created circumstances requiring mid-course corrections and restructuring, which were accomplished in academia through my budget committee service. 

Critical thinking skills are required for success in both engineering and academia. For instance, energy loans require persistent auditing to ensure they remain on track, and I was solely responsible for this aspect of a relatively large loan portfolio. I was also responsive to shifting circumstances, such as fluctuating oil prices, and monitored every loan based on its own production stream, but incorporating new information affecting all loans. To make a case attesting to each loan’s status required persistent development of case study information and data interpretation.
