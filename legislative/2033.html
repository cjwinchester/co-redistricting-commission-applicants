<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
As part of the Highlands Ranch Community Association (HRCA) Backcountry Planning Areas Advisory Committee, I was part of the effort to create a Community Involvement Process to represent the various interests of homeowners, developers and the community association for proposed/allowed development in Highlands Ranch open space areas. The final process acknowledged the frequently competing interests of stakeholders while providing for balanced dissemination, review and comment. This reasoned approach was tailored to work within prescribed HRCA and county structures while providing for project revision opportunities and evaluation of whether to advance to the next step in the process. I’ve learned that success is greatly enhanced when the group’s goals are first and foremost in mind. Whether it’s a community or school advisory committee or planning/leading numerous mission trips to the Czech Republic, I’ve found that understanding the human, material and structural resources available and anticipating possible difficulties lead to the best organizational outcomes. Further, establishing open and respectful communication spurs the group to accomplish its mission more creatively and efficiently.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I recognize the challenge and importance of fairly representing all citizens of Colorado. Recently, our state and nation has experienced notable division on numerous cultural, political and economic issues. We have a lot of challenges that our government might possibly address. It all begins with our citizens feeling and, in fact, being represented. The redistricting process must be interpreted as proper and reasonable. The resulting districts are the basis for representation to our government and the foundation of political participation. I believe in the principle of fair representation, that I can be impartial and respectful of the rights of Colorado citizens. Serving as a member of this commission would be an honor and opportunity for worthy investment in our democracy.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The most important aspect of creating consensus and agreement within the commission is to keep the redistricting criteria in mind. It’s a given that there will be differing, yet reasonable, opinions on certain issues among commission members. I think it’s important to recognize the value of other’s ideas and evaluate how that idea affects moves the commission towards the ultimate goal of creating fair and legal congressional districts. For example, as an airline captain, I’m tasked with making the best (safest) decision in any given situation. Consequently, I typically consider the given circumstances as I see them and call on the input of other personnel, whether they be a copilot, flight attendant, dispatcher or air traffic controller. Sometimes the best decision is not the one I originally envisioned, but one that’s enhanced with the perspective of someone who might see things from a different angle. I’ve found that making the BEST decision usually involves consulting others. The best decisions typically move toward more durable and fruitful success. I have the practiced ability to periodically step back from a discussion or situation, evaluate how the process is going, communicate my perspective and continue moving forward to accomplishing a safe flight, or in this case, the commission’s charter.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I can’t underestimate the value of utilizing the resources and data at hand in a given situation. Understanding what you want to accomplish and the information you have is essential to solving any problem. For example, during my college engineering education, I came to understand if you didn’t have the correct data or the right equation for the necessary analysis, no matter what you did, you wouldn’t really be getting anywhere. So rather than wasting time, I discovered it was important to define the goal and go about gathering the data required. Turns out that it’s also necessary to assess progress towards solving the problem. Am I still headed in the right direction? As an airline pilot, during an airborne emergency situation, it’s imperative, also, to define the problem. Through and training experience, I’m continually getting better at defining what the problem might be and methods on how to solve it. I also realize that I can call on experts to provide data and recommendations to help me make the best decision.
