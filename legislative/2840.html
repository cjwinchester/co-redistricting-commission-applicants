<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My only experience was during the 2016 election, when I campaigned actively for the proposed Amendment 69 to the Colorado Constitution and served on various committees that planned and coordinated the campaign.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have long been opposed to the political gerrymandering of legislative districts.  This commission represents all that is right with the process of making reapportionment a non-political process.  I have analytical and consensus building skills developed over forty years of legal wrangling and international work and I would like to use those skills in furthering this process.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I chaired a committee of people with conflicting ideas to draft the proposed Amendment 69 and was able to bring about a consensus for the final draft.  This work took almost a full year.  I also worked for then Senator Irene Aguilar and helped draft universal health care legislation beginning in 2013, working closely with attorneys at the Colorado Legislative Council.  I also worked with attorneys at the Legislative Council in 2015 and 2016 on similar legislation, and in 2016 on the language of the Amendment 69 initiative and in 2018-2019 on legislation to create a health care cost study commission. I&#39;ve helped organize and coordinate the unsuccessful campaign for Amendment 69 and have served in leadership positions with two American NGOs working in Kenya and with Rotary International.  I&#39;ve worked internationally with Americans and citizens of foreign countries in a variety of settings that required consensus building and ultimate agreements on projects.  I&#39;m good at building consensus and bringing people together in the search for the means to a common goal.  Through all this work I&#39;ve learned that people can legitimately disagree about a great many things even though they have a common goal.  I&#39;ve learned to listen to competing ideas and bring them together to further those goals.   NOTE:  I filled in the box marked &quot;Discuss your relevant analytical skills. . . .&quot; but for some reason the little green check mark never appeared and I cannot determine why it didn&#39;t, so my answer wasn&#39;t recorded.  Here it is.  &quot;The most important analytical skill I&#39;ve learned as an attorney is critical thinking, a skill that I picked up in law school and have honed over the last forty-two years.  Writing legal briefs (I&#39;ve authored over two hundred appeals), drafting legislation, and problem solving while working in countries as diverse as Afghanistan, Cambodia, Guyana, Myanmar, Kenya, Kosovo and the Territory of Puerto Rico, as well writing district and global grants for Rotary International and serving on the sub-committee that reviews district grants, have required me to use logic and reason as well as my persuasive skills to solving problems that were unique to the environment in which they arose.&quot;
