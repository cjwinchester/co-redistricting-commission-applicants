<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Over the past decade, I have sent out many emails to a political distribution list including friends, associates and media, containing news and information in promotion of a progressive agenda, and a strong democratically controlled government.  I have donated money, usually in $15 or $25 dollar increments to many progressive causes, the Democratic party, senatorial and congressional campaigns over the past dozen years.  ActBlue.com probably has a very detail account of most of them, all small. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have been a County Delegate a number of times, and a State Delegate once, in both cases for the Democratic Party. I have been an officially certified Poll Observer in the past Presidential and mid-term elections of the last dozen years, excluding the most recent. I have volunteered many times to work with the Gleneagle Home Owners Association on temporary projects, I have been a volunteer Tour Guide for the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center for five years.

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My wife and I have lived in Colorado most of our lives. We have been retired for some time, are very healthy, hike and bike a lot, and enjoy many interests to fill our time. The love of our state and the health of it and our nation&#39;s sacred institutions is a great concern. I understand and abhor the damage and extreme inequity that the process of Gerrymandering has had upon our system of Democracy. I am honored to live in a state that has the foresight to develop a process for ending this inequity. This is but one of many other forces in play that are corrosive to our Democracy. I want to be a part of the strengthening of our state and our country&#39;s integrity through a stronger Democracy. This Commission is the means, and I humbly submit my experience and energy to that goal.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am a person that believes that logical conclusion follows carefully presented fact in logical persons. I also believe that a fundamental fairness and understanding of the human condition is and should be embedded in logical conclusion. The combination of these things should guide me to impartial decision making and compromise with those who do not agree with my logical conclusion.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have been a long time Eagle Boy Scout, and leader as a young man. I have been a team leader on many software projects with Lockheed and Boeing. Each project with its time, staff, skills, and personality limitations is a test of a leader&#39;s ability to apply reason. The process of software development and test in itself is a constant trial of analytical skills and the application of logic to given problems. As in every experience much of the knowledge I&#39;ve gained has been in study and homework on the job. I have had years of experience and success in these skills.
