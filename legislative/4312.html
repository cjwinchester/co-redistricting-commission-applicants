<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I&#39;m a registered Democrat, but my dollars and time have been dedicated to non-partisan civic organizations like: United Way, Eugene Police Commission, CASA, and Susan G. Komen.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>

Komen (volunteer and race participant).

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
In Colorado I have done a significant amount of volunteering with and advocating for foster youth through my time with United Way and CASA (Court-appointed Special advocates). What I&#39;ve found to be the most valuable thing I can do in my volunteering and advocacy is listening to people. Listening to people&#39;s concerns, desires, frustrations, and needs is the only way you can gather the information needed to truly advocate and represent people, and unfortunately it&#39;s often the very thing people don&#39;t do. It is far easier to go in to a situation with your own preconceived ideas or solutions. One of my strengths is being curious about those that I work with and work for. I find that being curious allows me to go into situations with an open mind and I end up learning more than I would have otherwise. As a CASA volunteer, one of the things I have to do is advocate for foster youth in their court proceedings, which are often abuse and neglect cases. As a new volunteer, I would hear these cases of abuse and neglect and think that these children needed to be removed from the home immediately, having already determined that these parents weren&#39;t suited to parent. However, the more training I received and the more families I worked with, I learned that often times these parents weren&#39;t taught the fundamentals of parenting and they may have been abused themselves. By giving families the benefit of the doubt and tools to correct their actions, I was so surprised by how many parents fought like hell to keep their kids. This experience taught me that not every situation can be assessed at face value. By meeting people where they are and approaching every situation with curiosity you&#39;ll have the information you need to do your best advocacy work and you&#39;ll often have better outcomes too. I would take this same approach to working with fellow commissioners and tackling the work of the commission. I truly believe that this commission can be incredible because there&#39;s a diverse representation of political affiliation, not despite of it.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I would love to serve on the Commission because I think it would be an incredible opportunity to get to know my state better and a unique opportunity to work with a very diverse group of Coloradans. Since college, I have sought out opportunities and organizations that allow me to dedicate time to meaningful projects that will truly impact my community. Civic engagement is truly something that I&#39;m passionate about and I love the connections and knowledge I gain through the work.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I truly value difference and think it is one of the pillars that makes a commission/board/organization impactful. Due to the value that I place in diversity and difference, I seek out varying opinions and hold space for people to contribute regardless of their background/beliefs/personality type. In every organization that I devote my time to, I try to ensure that the group is focusing on achieving its stated goals through collaboration. Often when groups of people don&#39;t achieve consensus its because the group is lacking leadership or the focus is misplaced and personal goals are taking precedence over the stated objectives of the group. I will work with the other commission members to achieve our stated objectives and ensuring everyone feels valued and safe to contribute. In my capacity working with CASA I have to be fair and impartial when working with families and advocating for the foster youth I&#39;m working with. The way I&#39;m able to stay fair and impartial is be gathering facts and relying on the facts to steer my decision making, instead of relying on personal feelings or hearsay. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In my profession (marketing), I use analytical thinking and critical thinking quite often to assess how to best approach a market with a particular service or product. The first thing that I do when using analytical thinking is to gather and collect data about a particular market. For example: how old are the people in a certain demographic, what routes do they take to work where they might see a particular ad placement, what percentage of the demographic is within a certain economic bracket? Once I have data about a certain demographic then I will research more information about the population that I&#39;m trying to impact. I&#39;ll use the research I gather to inform the solution that I want to test on the demographic. Once I test out solutions I can see whether the proposed solution is producing the desired results. I use metrics to determine whether a solution is working in conjunction with qualitative observations. I would use this same approach to working with the commission, by first going in seeking information and then working with folks on the committee to conduct research needed to learn the necessary background, collaborate on solutions, experiment with our ideas, and recommend solutions.
