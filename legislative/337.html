</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have found success throughout my personal and professional life in guiding meetings and conversations to a place that promotes consensus. I once managed a 30-person team of graduate student volunteers, which is a fragile coalition to hold together since students always have competing interests for their time and, being volunteers, I could offer them no material incentives. I was ultimately able to keep the group engaged, and on this and other teams I have relied upon a few key building blocks to set the stage for productive collaboration.


First, confirm goals and check assumptions. Do we have a common understanding of our purpose? Are there facts we all recognize? Many disagreements can be forestalled by establishing a baseline of goals and information that the entire group accepts.


Second, match outcomes to goals. What does success look like? Does this hypothetical result comport with our mission? Why or why not? Holding up possible outcomes for consideration helps ground the group in the reality of their decisions.


Third, connect actions to outcomes. If we take this step, will it lead to the result we want? The result that we agree will help achieve our goals? Actions can be more easily agreed upon if their connections to prior points of consensus are made clear; it is also important to deliberately give proposed actions a reality check for unintended consequences.


Half the battle (at least) of gathering consensus from a diverse group lies in simply avoiding derailment, since tangents constantly threaten to intrude and have a tendency to build their own momentum once instigated. Furthermore, it is crucial to follow good evidence wherever it leads and to be an active listener who strives to hear the truth in the experiences of one’s peers. These steps, attitude, and adherence to evidence are crucial ingredients for impartiality and consensus-building, and I believe a good process leads to good outcomes. While a harmonious ending is never guaranteed, these factors maintain a focus on the right questions and lead to the right conversations. I will strive to foster this collaborative process on the Commission.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In my current work, I routinely analyze projects from policy, scientific, and engineering perspectives in order to judge their viability. Problems can arise from all sorts of angles and it’s my job to anticipate and mitigate those potential issues. In my brewing career, problems were often more acute and required immediate, effective action to resolve. There is little time to deliberate when an enormous tank is leaking, and so I developed a quick response time to problems that does not compromise the effectiveness of the solution. In my academic training, I built a foundation of logical and reasoned analysis since the field of chemistry tolerates no other type of analysis. In my leisure time, I’m always eager to learn a new board game or puzzle because they help me think about strategic problem solving in a new light. Tasks like the Commission’s are a good fit for me.
