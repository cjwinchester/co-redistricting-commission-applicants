<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My past political activity has been voting.  In 2016, I volunteered with the Hilary Clinton campaign for two days of door-to-door get out the vote activity.  This year, I volunteered with Vote Forward to send 20 letters to Texas voters, encouraging them to vote.  Also this year, I donated $25 to the Joe Biden/Kamala Harris presidential campaign and in 2019 I donated $25 to Andrew Yang during the Democratic primary race.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
As a working mother, I have not been as active in volunteer and civic organizations as I would like. Since November 10, 2015 I have volunteered a few times with Community Food Share in Boulder County to sort food; Volunteers for Outdoor Colorado to build trails; and just joined Meals on Wheels Coal Creek to deliver food to house-bound seniors. Now that my children are getting older and more independent, I look forward to being more engaged in the civic arena.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have worked with or for non-profit organizations for my entire career.  While my specific roles have been in finance and administration, as a senior leader I am well versed in the process of nonprofit advocacy and coalition building to achieve change.  My current employer uses a non-partisan approach to build support for our mission, one that I highly value. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
When I voted for the Colorado Independent Redistricting Commissions, I said to myself that I wanted to be a part of the process if possible. Voting is fundamental to a functioning democracy and is a right that has been hard fought for many people in this country. As a nation, and as a state, we are in an ongoing process to improve our ability to have free and fair elections.  I am proud to live in state like Colorado which has made great strides in that area with tools like same-day voter registration and mail-in balloting.  With the new Commissions, we are continuing to improve the value of an individual vote by allowing for process that can potentially reduce the impact of gerrymandering and create voting districts that are not geared to make sure one party always wins. Every politician should earn their election by listening to and representing the people of their district. But if districts are drawn so that one party has an advantage, it can lead to politicians catering solely to their base and ignoring dissenting views. I have seen over the past 20 years a hardening in our political environment with less dialogue and compromise which is not in the best interests of our democracy. I would be proud to be a part of this new initiative to see if we in Colorado can maximize the effectiveness of our political process so each citizen of this state truly feels represented.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my professional and personal life, creating consensus is a core value. I begin with listening to learn and understand â€“ what are the core issues and the root problems that need to be addressed? The next step is to begin problem-solving by identifying different approaches and working through scenarios.  In some cases, groups reach consensus but at times groups can get stuck.  That is when clarity of roles and decision-making authority is critical so that each person understands what they are contributing to a decision-making process. I also always endeavor for clear, authentic communication to develop mutual trust. With this as a foundation, I think I will be able to be fair and impartial during the redistricting process because my agenda is not to represent one party or another but to find ways to move together to strengthen our democratic process. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In my roles as a Director of Finance and Operation, I am continually using analytical skills to monitor and forecast financial data and to adjust and improve operational processes. As a part of a leadership team, I am constantly evaluating and making decisions about complex problems that range from developing our strategic plan to human resources management to resource allocation.  I use logic, facts and data to guide problem solving combined with collaboration and solicitation of multiple perspectives to test assumptions.
