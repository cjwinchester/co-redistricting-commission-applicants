<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>

</p>

  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I was a policy fellow for Teach Plus Colorado for the 2018-2019 school year, which meant that I got to learn about how education policy is made in Colorado with a group of teachers from across the state. My group focused on teacher evaluation. I continued that work the following year, as part of a group of teachers who wrote a report for legislators about teacher evaluation.
I have volunteered for Dylan Roberts’s (HD-26) campaign, and donated to Diane Mitsch Bush (CD-3) and Beatriz Soto (Garfield County commissioner candidate), as well as been a petition holder and volunteer for the Initiative 271 campaign this past summer.
With Mountain Voices Project, I organized a non-partisan get out the vote project in Garfield County this fall.

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Roaring Fork Community Education Association, building rep
Teach Plus Colorado, policy fellow
Mountain Voices Project (broad based community organizing), leader
Trail Sisters Roaring Fork Valley

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a policy fellow for Teach Plus, I got to work with teachers, policy makers, and other stakeholders across the state to take a close look at SB 10-191 and our teacher evaluation process. This meant that I spent time reaching out to and listening to teachers, parents, administrators, and students throughout Western Colorado. I then had the task of taking all of the thoughts and opinions I had heard, and working with my colleagues from across the state to bring together disparate opinions and summarize them in a report, with recommendations to policy makers. Similarly, as a leader in Mountain Voices Project (a broad based community organizing group), I listen to teachers and families at my school and bring their perspectives and stories to Mountain Voices Project. Together, we determine organizing priorities for our bigger community, and act on those. Our primary priorities are healthcare, childcare, aging in our community, a proposed quarry, and covid recovery.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The Roaring Fork Valley is 40 miles long, but part of four different counties. We have three different state representatives, and two different state senators. This makes it particularly hard for us to have our voices heard.  I know that this commission will not address the issues that we face by being a part of so many different counties, but this experience has shown me how important representation is. I want to be a part of redistricting in Colorado to help all communities feel like they have fair representation. Also, I share a hometown with Elbridge Gerry (Marblehead, MA), so I feel a responsibility to combat gerrymandering!
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
A big part of my teaching philosophy is restorative justice. Restorative justice, as applied in a fifth grade classroom, is about helping people see that their actions have an impact on others. I believe that being impartial doesn’t mean being neutral; it means thinking about all of the stakeholders, and seeing the issue through all of their lenses. This is also how I will promote consensus. My work on the district housing committee and as a part of our teacher’s union has helped me learn to listen to multiple perspectives, and to find commonalities between them.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I was an engineering minor in college, and while I don’t use much of the knowledge that I learned, I do use the engineering mindset every day. I like to see all of the parts of a problem, whether that’s plannng out a year long curriculum map or redesigning a daily schedule to fit with covid regulations. I am also the go-to person at my work for anything regarding spreadsheets!
I also, in general, just love maps. You can often find me in the evening with multiple maps unfolded over my living room, or pulling up CalTopo on my computer, searching for new zones for ski touring and new routes for biking and running adventures. In college, I took several classes in GIS, and understand the fundamentals of map building and using maps to represent data.
