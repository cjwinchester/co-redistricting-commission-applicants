<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
The longest and broadest example of such advocacy stems from my service to the Public Trustee Association of Colorado, on its board and on its legislative committee. Working with representatives of all 64 Colorado counties helped me develop a deeper understanding of the variety of interests in different parts of the state. While I represented a very large county, I recognized that proposals that might make sense in Colorado Springs would not meet the needs of rural counties. At the same time, I also learned how to help the elected officials in those counties understand the needs of the larger and urban counties. 
Since 2007, I have also advocated for the protection of public lands in Colorado. I helped lead an effort to map out the boundaries of a large roadless area in the Rampart Range and promote awareness of the recreational opportunities in that area. My work resulted in the addition of over 1000 acres to the roadless area by discovering mapping errors. I have continued my advocacy through developing and coordinating public comments on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management proposals and by helping Wild Connections develop reports on lands with wilderness characteristics. I also take direct action in this area: as a certified trail crew leader, I have led teams to design, build, and repair trails in El Paso, Teller, and Douglas counties.
From 2008-2014, I served as an at-large member of the Community Advisory Committee to the Pikes Peak Area Council of Governments. In that role, I heard the concerns of different groups within the region and helped evaluate priorities for infrastructure and parks.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the commission because I believe I that fair redistricting is a cornerstone of representative democracy and because my soft and hard skills will both contribute to a process that will serve the people of Colorado.
I have been interested in redistricting since college, when I participated in a 1985 project led by Common Cause in Indiana. I demonstrated that it was possible to create a city council district in South Bend, Indiana, that united much of the central-city African American community in one district rather than dispersing the members of that community among districts that extended from the center to outlying neighborhoods. I continued working with Common Cause in Indiana in a citizen-led effort to show how single-member state legislative districts could be created that respected jurisdictional boundaries. At that time, in the early 1990s, Indiana used multimember districts around some major cities that diluted the voting power of certain communities by merging them with outlying areas that would drown out their voice.
I resumed engaging with redistricting after my retirement from the Air Force. I provided comments on El Paso County Commissioner districts, where the process was particularly disturbing. The county would tweak its maps frequently, shuffling precincts to ensure that one party would win every seat. Sometimes a precinct would be swapped so frequently that its citizens would not be able to vote for commissioner for several cycles. In recent years, the county has gone to extremes to imagine communities of interest that are not based on the real identities of local citizens. My dismay at this process was one of the reasons I ran for County Clerk and Recorder in 2010.
After being defeated by Wayne Williams for county office, I actively participated in the public comments for 2010 statewide redistricting and also became involved in a successful effort to reduce the proportion of at-large city council seats from 5 of 9 to 3 of 9. Prior to this, no city council members were living in the central areas of the city. I then engaged with community groups to argue for a district that would unify the southeastern portion of the community, with its distinct interests, rather than splitting and dispersing that community among several districts.
My overall takeaway from these experiences is that elected officials have an inherent conflict of interest in redistricting: preserving their own power and that of their political party. These override an important principle of living in a democratic republic: that the voters select their representatives, not the other way around.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I demonstrated my ability to be fair and impartial while I was serving as Public Trustee for El Paso County for 11 years. In that role, I had to ensure that my deputies and I administered foreclosure law fairly and equitably, setting aside any personal feelings about particular cases or how we might wish the law were different. 
I will be able to promote consensus and contribute to creating agreement because I am good at listening to others and understanding their interests and preferences. That allows me to reflect on their argument and show good faith by reconsidering my own positions and where they could be more in alignment with those of others. At the same time, I am able to couch my own views in ways that appeal to the values that others hold. This was particularly useful as a member of the Public Trustee Association Board and Legislative Committee, during which time most of my colleagues were elected officials of another political party and had been representing rural counties for many years.
My ability to promote consensus in those ways largely stems from my Air Force career, as described in more detail in the next answer. In most assignments, I was by rank the junior person even when I was a peer on the organization chart. That meant that the only way I could promote safety, design decisions, or a wartime engagement strategy was by persuasive discussion and making sure that I had data to back up my position. I also found it helpful to let others take credit for my ideas as if they were their own rather than merely coming into agreement with me. These experiences also taught me to engage when I thought it really mattered and hold off from trying to get my way for its own sake. 
I have also used these skills to build coalitions during public lands discussion periods. While environmental groups share broad common goals, they do differ in their priorities. It was important to find ways to get several groups to sign on to a single letter rather than taking divergent positions that would not help land managers reach the decision we preferred. The comments I developed for these federal decisions were always richly detailed in maps and coordinates that provided rich detail about facts on the ground that were the basis of our response.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have strong mathematical and linguistic skills. I taught research methods for several years at the Air Force Academy and now coach graduate students through the development and execution of research projects. This requires me to help them use logic and reason to develop methods that will answer their questions.
While my graduate degrees are in political science, I am trained as an engineer. My Air Force acquisition assignments fell into the realm of systems engineering, which is defined by bringing logic and reason to problems. Early on, I conducted a safety analysis of the Air Force One wiring system that became the basis for a high-level decision not to retrofit the system because the risk was acceptable. Soon after that, I helped Strategic Air Command develop workable solutions to a problem with isocyanate hazards in missile maintenance facilities. Toward the end of my time in weapons system acquisition, I was in charge of ensuring that the implementation and installation of a new pilot training management system would meet the needs of the Air Force and the country.
I spent fall 2004 in Baghdad, where I served as the political strategist for the military coalition. To an even greater extent than other assignments, this work required me to obtain and synthesize a vast amount of information—on militias, the campaign plan, the Iraqi election, a Sunni Arab engagement strategy, and many other topics—and develop succinct summaries and recommendations for command. As one of the most junior officers in the strategy office, I had to rely on tight logic and reason when presenting information that was often not what senior leaders wanted to hear. This work was also conducted in a fairly high-stress environment.
A particular strength that sets me apart from others in these areas is my skill at mapping and spatial representation. While it may not translate directly to the work of a commission member, I am very good at understanding geographic relationships. Beyond my comments to public lands management plans, I am a skilled land navigator in the backcountry and have designed and constructed new trail alignments in the forest. Both of those tasks require an agility at abstract manipulation of space to understand how to best create a route, either for the day’s hike or for a trail. Similar abstract manipulations may be helpful in envisioning options for develop legislative districts that serve the interests of the people of Colorado.
