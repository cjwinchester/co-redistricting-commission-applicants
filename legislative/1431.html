        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Kyle Scott Bradell</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Kyle Scott Bradell
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Uber/Lyft Driver.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  The highest education I have is an undergraduate&#39;s degree from Saint Louis University in which I earned it in only three years. My degree is in political science and Spanish.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80210
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
My experience comes from running for political office and a member of RTD&#39;s disability committee. While on the disability committee, I have advocated greatly that RTD does more. I have seen for three years now that RTD is very slow in making decisions. When I share my ideas and solutions, the disability committee members agree with me. Outside of that, nothing else.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
2016 - GOP Candidate for Colorado&#39;s 6th Congressional District. I lost at the GOP 6th Congressional Convention in April 2016.
2020 - RTD Board of Directors District A. RTD is nonpartisan and, as such, I attended local Democrat and Republican meetings to let voters know they could vote for me. I lost the election.
I have donated to the Trump Campaign since 2017. Maybe once to the Colorado State GOP party. I have paid entrance fees to GOP meetings for breakfast clubs and lunch clubs. For local and state campaigns, I don&#39;t think I have ever donated to an individual candidate campaign.
Also, forgot to add a precinct person for my precinct for the 2020 election cycle.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
For the past three years, I have been a volunteer member on RTD&#39;s Advisory Committee for People with Disabilities (ACPD).
I graduated from Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG)&#39;s Citizens Academy.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
One, it is my duty to serve America. Just like President John F. Kennedy said: &quot;Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.&quot; Well, I am doing exactly what he said with serving on this Commission.
Two, I enjoy challenges and solving puzzles. I was an accountant for almost 9 years. Everyday I had problems coming my way, but I soon discovered that many of these problems can be avoided with easy solutions and talking to my coworkers. And I did just that and it worked!
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I can be fair and impartial easily. For example, while running for the nonpartisan race of RTD, I went to Democrat and Republican meetings. I went door-to-door during my campaign asking for people&#39;s votes. I did not care if they were Green, Socialist, Republican, Unaffiliated, etc. I care greatly about RTD and wanted everyone to know how I can make it better for everyone. I can promote consensus amongst the commissioners as I have patience and the ability to listen to people. I prefer to listen, first, before making any kind of judgement. That way, I can think carefully and provide great ideas and solutions that will work for my colleagues, such as the commissioners.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
For this answer, it comes from almost nine years as an accountant. As a former accountant, I had to apply logic and reason to problems every single day. If I didn&#39;t nothing would get done and the balance sheets and the GLs would be messed up allowing the potential for misuse of funds and runaway expenses. Thus, I can do the same with this Commission. There is only a set number of people that Colorado will have. This means we can easily piece the puzzle together and come to an amicable solution for everyone.
