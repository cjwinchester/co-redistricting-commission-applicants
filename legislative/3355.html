In Aug 2020 I donated roughly $150 between Joe Biden, Vote Save America, and the Diane Mitsch Bush Campaign.  I also volunteered for my Precinct (20) during September and October of 2020.  Other than those engagements, I have not been politically active.

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
During college I was in the President&#39;s Leadership Class which was a 4 year scholarship program at CU designed to study leadership, civil service, and communities in Colorado.  During that time I spent a great deal of energy focused on organizing activities, developing curriculums, and learning about various groups in the state.  However, that was 15 years ago.

Since that time, I have been predominately involved only in CU Alumni activities where we have worked hard to engage alumni in the Grand Valley with mediocre response.  We were awarded the Volunteer Organization of the Year in 2019 thanks to partnering with the local Rotary club to raise $20,000 in scholarship funds.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
In my time working with the CU Alumni board as a chapter president, I&#39;ve gleaned a great deal of insight into our community and state, but moreover, insight into my goals for civil engagement.  My overarching sense is that pouring my energy into football watch parties is not where I am going to make any meaningful difference.  I want to contribute my time, skills, and energy into action that makes actual growth in our state and country.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My expertise is working as a couple&#39;s therapist.  In that work, I spend a great deal of time sitting with people who vehemently disagree, yet share a goal.  In this work it is absolutely crucial that I am fair and impartial in order for there to be any success.  Seeing different perspectives, encouraging productive and respectful dialogue, and staying focused on a common goal, are skills that I practice every day as a matter of professional integrity and necessity.   
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My training as a therapist is all about searching below the surface details and looking for the core conflicts/fears/motivating factors.  I am keenly observing and tracking those underlying motives at all times.  The model of couple&#39;s counseling I practice is rooted in a logical and systemic way of seeing any conflict.  Being able to zoom-out from the details and conceptualize an overarching theme/model/system is the skill I work at every day.  Visual aids such as drawings, as well as metaphors are also ways that I am able to improve my skills and convey my understanding.
