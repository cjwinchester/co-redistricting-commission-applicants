<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Most of my active political work predated 2015. I worked as a volunteer for several campaigns in high school in NYC and college in Washington, DC. I was a congressional intern for Sen. Chuck Schumer in Washington, D.C. when he was a freshman in the fall of 1999. I was a 20 hour a week volunteer for the Ritter for Governor campaign in 2006. I have not been actively engaged in any political campaigns since that time. I have not donated to any campaigns since 2015. My family has an ongoing monthly donation to the ACLU for $20 per month.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I served on the New America School board of directors, a network of three charter schools in the Denver-metro area serving new immigrants and high-risk students, from 2010-2016, serving as Board Chair from 2012-2016. I am a member and treasurer of my neighborhood (Fieldstone) HOA board.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I served as an advocate and lobbyist on behalf of several education-related issues in Colorado, primarily between the years of 2005-2015. I was an education policy specialist and represented the interests of the National Conference of State Legislatures, the trade association for state legislators and staff, from 2007-2010. I was the VP of Public Affairs and registered lobbyist for the Colorado League of Charter Schools, the trade association for Colorado&#39;s charter schools, from 2010-2013. Finally, I served as an informal political/policy advisor for a family office in Colorado from 2015-2016.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am a deep believer in the power of democracy driven by the people, especially the critical notion of &quot;one person, one vote.&quot; It is my firm conviction that when every vote counts equally, then elected representatives have to be more responsive to the people who put them in power. This couples with my equally firm belief in representative democracy where the people decide to grant the power to represent their interests to elected officials that are duty bound to be informed policymakers working to advance policies for the benefit of those who elected them, not national parties or special interest groups. Unfortunately, gerrymandering of district boundaries done by elected officials creates &quot;safe&quot; districts where only a percentage of votes cast actually shift a race, reducing the impact of every vote and diluting the idea of one person, one vote. Colorado has been better than other states in how competitively districts are drawn, yet partisan disagreements have still resulted in every map being deliberated and finalized by the courts. It would be an extraordinary honor to be part of the process to draw fair maps that hopefully do not have to go to the courts for revisions, creating more competitive legislative districts where every vote counts equally. I like to think that this Colorado citizen-led commission and the resulting districts could serve as a national example of what can be done when we leave it to the people to decide our representation, not national parties. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that the most important factor in creating consensus is trust: trust that those involved in significant public decision-making like this commission are doing it for the greater good and not for personal advancement or accolades. However, I also know that all individuals bring their own experiences, beliefs and cognitive biases into any group decision-making process, especially ones with high stakes, which is absolutely a benefit, but also likely leads to disagreements. I would take my role in this commission very seriously and would do all I can to leave my biases outside of the room and engage in trust building with my fellow commissioners. I think this requires vulnerability and a willingness to hear all sides before making any decisions. This is the method I employed as chair of the New America School board of directors for 6 years, where many high-stakes decisions had to be made to successfully steward the organization. If we commissioners see each other as teammates in a joint mission to help create the fairest legislative maps in the country, rather than competitors attempting to advance a system that benefits the few, then I believe that consensus can happen with open negotiations, trust, and goal to advance the greater good. Because a fair map with competitive districts is in the best interest of all Coloradoans. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I practice a very deliberate and logic-driven approach to major decision-making. This necessitates having as much information as possible to reduce unknowns and suss out the unintended consequences of a decision, something I feel is not done enough in public decision-making. I am a voracious reader and think deeply about public decision-making, both as part of my current career and also as a hobby. I seek out and consume information from all sides of an issue to see how a problem is framed and what is recommended as solutions before making any major decisions. I employ various logic models to my own decision-making, both personally and professionally, and would continue this practice as a member of the commission.
