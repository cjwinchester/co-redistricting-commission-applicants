<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As an educator, my daily responsibilities include advocating for my students and their families. One of my essential duties is to provide a space where students can feel they can express themselves, advocate for their own needs, demonstrate their progress in ways that reflect their strengths, and consider the challenges they face as a learner. In addition to working for the interests of a diverse population of students, I also consider the needs of other stakeholders in education- parents/families and my administration. In order to be successful, I consistently serve as a liaison between various (sometimes intersecting,but often disjointed) groups of people in order to best support the interests of many. 
I have also worked with young people outside of the classroom as a board member of a non-profit organization that promotes leadership development for Latinx youth. Every year we research how to serve our participants to succeed in higher education and their chosen profession. The curriculum we develop considers individual experience, cultural background and access to available resources. The support we offer involves great familiarity with several layers of community ties and kinship. Very often there is a marked generational gap between participants in the program and their guardians; it is imperative to communicate effectively and with transparency with respect to lived experiences and perceptions in order for true progress to be made. 

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the commission primarily to help represent and advocate for the best truth of the Colorado community. I have lived in Colorado since 2004 and have witnessed incredible transformation in the makeup of this community. The demographics of any place can swiftly change and Colorado is not the same as it was a decade ago- and this needs to be reflected accurately. The best way to get a clear picture of Colorado is by listening to the stories of all those who reside here. Because of my experiences as a teacher in a rapidly developing area and my heavy involvement in the community, I am confident that I can advocate fairly and knowledgeable for a wide base of people. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
One of my strengths is my ability to communicate and build relationships. As mentioned earlier, I am a teacher and I have a moral obligation to present myself as neutral, while still advocating for the needs and interests of many- maneuvering between what is expected, needed and desired of the trifecta in education- students, parents, and administrators. It is a constant cycle of communication, diplomacy and mediation to hear their words and attempt to translate so others can hear and consider other viewpoints and teachers often do this daily. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Referring again to my experiences as an educator (both in the classroom and in the community), I use data to inform my teaching. I need to consider not only how well students are progressing, but HOW. My data is taken from formal assessments as well as observations of student behavior. I will reflect on understanding the reasoning for negative and positive outcomes- What can I do differently and what can I keep the same? What is the most efficient way to do this? What is not the most efficient way, but the most equitable way? Will this be accessible to more than just one type of learner? The decisions I make in the classroom are based on quick analysis that is not only flexible or adaptable, but accessible. Not only must I accomplish this quickly, but I also need to do so in such a way that is considerate of the impact it could potentially have on more than one individual or homogenous group of people.
