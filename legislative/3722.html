<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I am invited to speak at numerous high schools, colleges, and community organizations on behalf of people of color and women. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As a Mexican American woman, I would like to serve on the commission to help assure that our district maps reflect fairly the people who live in Colorado, particularly those who are traditionally underserved.  As a state legislator, I participated in the process during the 1980 redistricting efforts.  Our democratic form of government cannot work as needed without maps that fairly reflect the demographics of every community in Colorado, our state and our country’s population.  As someone whose family has lived in what is now Colorado since the 1600s, I am committed to assuring that all Coloradans, regardless of background, have an equal opportunity to be represented and participate in our community and government. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a state legislator for 12 years I worked with those who had different perspectives in order to reach consensus and get legislation passed.  The same is true for the numerous boards and commissions on which I have participated over the past 50   years.  As the Executive Director of the Colorado Hispanic Institute, I developed a statewide multicultural leadership enhancement program aimed at assisting community leaders from different ethnic and racial groups to broaden their leadership potential by becoming skilled in cultural competence.  As a member of Denver University’s Strategic Issues Panel on Campaign Reform (2012) and DU’s Strategic Issues Panel on Immigration Reform (2009), I worked with individuals from different backgrounds and points of view to achieve consensus on how to address these issues.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a State Senator, I served on the Legislative Audit Committee for a number of years and gained knowledge on the state budgeting process.  As the CEO of two non-profit agencies, I had to engage in strategic planning as well as critical thinking in order to manage the agencies.  As Regional Administrator, General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region VIII, I directed a staff of 476 employees responsible for a six-state region that supported 48,000 government employees who worked for 43 federal agencies in 601 GSA owned and leased buildings in Colorado, Montana, North and South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming and managed an operating budget of $161 million with oversight of an additional $246 million in construction and repairs of Federal facilities.  As Special Assistant to President Bill Clinton and Director of the United States Office of Consumer Affairs, The White House, Washington, D.C., I served as the chief consumer advocate for the Administration, chaired the Consumer Affairs Council, which consisted of representatives of 41 different federal agencies, chaired the U.S. delegation to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Committee on Consumer Policy, and represented consumers on the federal Information Infrastructure Task Force.  In that capacity I had to employ mediation, problem solving, and consensus-building skills.  As a Public Information Officer for a White House Agency, I supervised the development of the Information Office and all communications with the mass media and public-at-large.  In that capacity, I supervised all media arrangements for the 1967 Cabinet Committee Hearings on Mexican Americans and coordinated press relations with the Secret Service for presentations by the President and Vice President of the United States.  As the Editor of a labor union magazine I supervised the development of a 32-page magazine for the Union&#39;s airline employees, researched and wrote all news articles.  I also developed testimony for Congressional Hearings and assisted with other research and education activities.  As the Editorial Assistant, Department of Research and Education, for an International labor union, I was responsible for researching, writing and editing news articles, preparing layout and coordinating artwork for a 16-page newspaper published monthly for 100,000 subscribers.  In that capacity, I received three International Labor Press Association awards.
