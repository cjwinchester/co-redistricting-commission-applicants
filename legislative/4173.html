<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>

  Truman Bradley
</p>

  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Executive Director, Marijuana Industry Group
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Masters in Business Administration (MBA) from the University of Colorado&#39;s Leeds School of Business
BA in Philosophy from the University of Colorado
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80033
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
As a registered democrat I have contributed to local and national democratic candidates including:
Hillary Clinton, Biden Victory Fund, Phil Weiser for Colorado, and James Coleman
I have also contributed to non-partisan organizations including: Colorado Common Cause, Colorado COVID Relief Fund, Humane Society of Boulder Valley, The Colorado Fourteeners Initiative, The ALS Association,
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I was a board member of the West Colfax Association of Neighbors from 2016 - 2018
I volunteered at the First Universalist Church of Denver in 2015. 
In 2020, I received an official appointment to the Colorado Task Force on Drunk and Impaired Driving, where I participate on a monthly basis. 

I also volunteer my time as a mentor for The Color of Cannabis, a non-profit that seeks to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in the licensed cannabis industry for individuals who have been disproportionately affected by the war on drugs.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My primary role as Executive Director of the Marijuana Industry Group (MIG) is to represent the large number of Colorado licensed marijuana businesses as well as ancillary companies. This means I work with a diverse group of business leaders to advocate for sensible cannabis regulations. This requires me to be fair, impartial, and to be a good listener, as the MIG members often have different and competing opinions about what is best for the industry and for Coloradans. At the request of the Department of Revenue, Governor Polis, as well as local municipalities including Denver, Aurora, and Boulder, I serve as a member of stakeholder working groups to advise these government officials on cannabis policy. These workgroups include topics including: Science and Policy, Social Equity, Licensing, COVID safety, Drunk and Impaired Driving reduction, and Licensing. When I served on the Board for the West Colfax Association of Neighbors I represented one of the most diverse communities in all of Denver. The Board and I considered requests for zoning changes, volunteer opportunities, licenses. One of my duties included inviting and serving as monitor for debates among candidates for local elections including City Council, Denver School Board, and others. One important part of this role was making sure candidates from all parties received equal time to share their visions and plans. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the commission because I believe that fair maps are crucial to allowing Coloradans an equal and fair voice in our elections. I have the time to devote to this important mission and, if chosen, promise to build consensus among the commissioners and to help draw fair maps that represent all Coloradans, not just democrats. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my job every day, I work to build consensus among nearly 50 members, many of whom have different viewpoints and opinions. I do this by making sure everyone gets a voice. I practice active listening, so that members know they have been heard. This is literally the main part of my job. Additionally, on the numerous stakeholder groups in which I participate, I make commitments to work alongside people holding very different views from mine, in order to make sound recommendations to government. If chosen to this commission, I will commit to working together with the other commissioners to build a fair map.
