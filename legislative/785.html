<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Executive Director, Together We Count
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>

</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have no past political activity outside of voting. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
N/A
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have extensive, recent, and relevant experience working across Colorado advocating for an accurate census count. I co-founded Coloradoâ€™s first census engagement organization, Together We Count, to ensure that all Coloradans were counted in the 2020 Census. We traveled across the state training to advocacy  groups, governmental organizations, and community members on the census process and ways to engage their local communities. Colorado is a diverse state with complex geographic and local issues, and I worked to unite and engage a wide variety of stakeholders around a critical part of our civic life and democracy.
 
I have also recently been a part of Count Me In, which is a non-partisan ballot education group. We created a non-partisan ballot factsheet and conducted presentations to constituents on statewide ballot initiatives. Colorado being a ballot heavy state, we worked to ensure our population on all sides is informed on what will impact our state.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Through my experience working statewide, I have deep knowledge of the new demographic data and the census, and I am committed to the new more transparent process that takes into account all Coloradans. The past two years I have extensively traveled to almost every part of Colorado and have a thorough understanding of the particular challenges and opportunities facing each region. We are a unique state and need to ensure that the different regions and communities are given fair and effective districts.
 
2020 was a challenging year for a national headcount, and I saw first-hand the delays and confusion and how it impacted our state and residents filling out the form. Redistricting is an incredibly important process that I want to be a part of because it  will impact generations of Coloradans. As a native of Colorado, I have seen how our state has changed, with population booms creating seismic shifts in our demography. Districts are for the people, and we need to ensure that communities are aware of how their communities have changed and the impacts of the changes. We have a tremendous opportunity with the new way of redistricting to facilitate the transparent process inherent in the language of the amendment, that will benefit constituents. 

I believe my experience and knowledge from working on the 2020 Census, as well as my background and personal connection to Colorado will be an asset and provide a unique and diverse perspective to the commission.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
One of my strengths is engaging diverse stakeholders and constituents and finding areas of agreement on an issue in order to collaborate towards a common goal, which I believe is a critical element of promoting consensus and finding solutions that everyone can live with. For the redistricting process, we have common baselines already in the process including ensuring the district lines comply with the Voting Rights Act, competitive districts, and to guarantee that Colorado constituents receive fair and effective representation. At the core of redistricting is the data. I have a commitment to redistricting with a thoughtful data driven approach and ensuring that diverse voices are present throughout the process, both from the commission and from community stakeholders.
