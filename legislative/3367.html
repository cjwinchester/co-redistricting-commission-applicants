<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I was elected to serve on the Board of Directors of the Evergreen Park &amp; Recreation District, a Colorado special district and served from 2008 to 2012 and was reelected and served from 2012 to 2016.  This was a nonpartisan position and I had support across the political spectrum.  This continued in 2014 when I ran for state representative of House District 25.  
I have donated to numerous political campaigns and organizations including, in the past several years, those of John Hickenlooper for the US Senate, Lisa Cutter for Colorado State Representative, Diane Mitsch Bush for US House, Joe Biden for President, Amy McGrath for US Senate, Lesley Dahlkemper for Jeffco Commissioner, Meghan Nutting for Colorado State Representative, Ashley Wheeland for Colorado State Representative, Joe Neguse for US House, Field Team 6, Black Voters Matter, Black Alliance for Just Immigration, Georgia NAACP, Women on the Rise and SNaPCo.  I also have volunteered at various times for phone banking and door knocking.

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have been involved in numerous community and philanthropic activities over the years. One of the most significant and successful efforts was the creation of the Evergreen Shelter Program (ESP). ESP was developed and organized by At Home in Evergreen in partnership with Evergreen Christian Outreach to address an unmet need in Evergreen and surrounding mountain communities for temporary housing in the severe weather months for people experiencing homelessness, one of the most marginalized groups in our society. Due to the distance from the nearest permanent shelters and the colder temperatures in Evergreen and its surrounding communities, the shelter system was created to provide overnight accommodations, hot meals and a place of respite for the homeless living in the area. Initially,
there was resistance to the idea due to preconceived notions that either there wasn’t a homeless population in Evergreen or that providing shelter would increase crime or drug use. I engaged in open communication with and education of the community, which helped to alleviate these concerns. We raised funds, recruited host faith organizations and recruited and trained volunteers. ESP opened for its first season in the winter of 2016-2017. As a result of my community involvement and participation on the leadership team of ESP, I was asked to serve as treasurer and become a member of the board of directors of At Home. Prior to opening for the second season, we raised additional funds through a grant that I wrote and submitted to Rotary District 5450 to make the shelter accessible for people with families by providing individual tents, cots and bedding within each host shelter to provide privacy for families. ESP now is entering its 5th year of operations.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Since I retired, my time has been spent serving the various communities of which I am a part. I believe I have and will continue to bring about positive change by engagement in civic and community work. During the past 15 years, I have served in various capacities with numerous community organizations and have been directly engaged in the political process by running for office. These experiences as well as my philanthropic service have brought me into contact with people with wide ranging backgrounds and views. As a result, I have developed a unique and diverse perspective that, combined with my strengths, will make mine a valuable voice on the commission.

Over the decades I have lived in Colorado, I have seen the state change in many ways - from politics to employment opportunities to population changes and land use. It is vitally important to ensure the new district boundaries are fairly and accurately redrawn to reflect the changes in population data gathered from the 2020 census and ensure there is no ethnic or racial discrimination and that all communities of interest are appropriately included. My own experience of running for office and talking with people across a district that included rural, suburban and mountain communities reinforced how important it is to listen to all voices with their different perspectives and experiences.  The final redistricting map must ensure that each and every Coloradan has a voice in the future of the state without regard to partisan politics and that each and every community in Colorado has a representative who truly represents that community. It will be fascinating and a privilege to be involved in charting a part of the future path of Colorado.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I was raised in a family of different political views which led to being open to differences and an ability to discuss and integrate them into my thinking.  This has continued throughout my life as one thing has been a constant in the diverse settings of my varied career - I have had to balance the interests of varied constituencies to build consensus. Consensus building will be key to ensuring the commission is able to successfully complete its task of fair and impartial redistricting. The strengths I have developed that lead to successful consensus building include communication, transparency, creative thinking and the ability to elicit and understand different perspectives. My strengths will assist in both the commission deliberations and during the public hearings to collect community input. 

My ability to promote consensus and reach agreement among the commissioners results from my many years of experience doing just that in my professional life and in the community and civic work in which I have engaged since then. As just one example of this experience, for the past year Community First Foundation has been going through a strategic planning process to update and revise its strategic plan. This process has covered all aspects of its business, from the programs and grants it provides to its philanthropic partners and grant recipients, to the programs and services it provides to its donors, to the oversight and use of its $450 million investment portfolio. As a member of the board of directors and the strategic planning committee I have been intimately involved in this process. Each board member, each staff person and each of the Foundation’s many partners throughout the state of Colorado brought to the table their own view on how CFF should operate, who it should serve and how it should provide those services, many of which were competing and incompatible. As I viewed it, my responsibility was to ensure that each of those voices was represented, heard and balanced against competing interests and views. Only in this manner could I, as a board member, ensure that the new strategic plan would truly serve the Foundation’s varied constituencies in the most effective and positive manner possible. The new strategic plan recently has been finalized and is being rolled out to the public. Throughout this process spanning many meetings and hundreds of hours, I made sure that I heard all voices, understood them and helped to meld them into a plan that reflected the best possible path forward for Community First, its non-profit partners, its donors, its employees and all of the communities it serves throughout Colorado. I was able to do this independent of my own views on what the ultimate strategic plan should be because I understand and accept that opening myself to hear the views of others that are based on different life and work experiences will result in a “product” that incorporates the best of all thinking and views.

Fairness and impartiality describe exactly what the underpinnings of the redistricting map should represent and what the people of Colorado voted for in 2018 when they voted to overhaul the state’s redistricting process. I believe in the multi-party political system in the United States and Colorado and believe it provides the checks and balances every citizen deserves. I hope that every person selected to serve on the commission is open minded and motivated solely by the desire to produce what the voters of Colorado want - an impartial, fair and representative map that reflects a nonpartisan accord for the good of all Coloradans.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a lawyer and then as an executive running a company, applying logic and reason to creatively problem solve has been necessary for me to be effective. Those experiences have enabled me to serve as an effective and productive member of various boards of directors and community committees as well. I developed and honed skills such as strategic planning, collaborative management and consensus building throughout my professional and philanthropic work that will be directly applicable to the work of the commission. Research skills, including investigation, data
collection and interpretation and fact checking are cornerstones of providing sound legal advice to former clients and now will be particularly useful serving on the commission. The combination of my educational background and my professional and community work make me uniquely qualified to serve on the commission and ensure that its work is efficient and successful.
