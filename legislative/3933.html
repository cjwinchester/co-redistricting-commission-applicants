<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I hold a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) degree from Colorado State University. I also hold a Master&#39;s of Public Health (MPH) from the Colorado School of Public Health. I completed a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology with minor courses of study in business, Spanish, and international studies at Penn State University.

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I donated less than $100 to the Bernie Sanders Presidential Campaign in 2016. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Colorado Veterinary Medical Association (current member)
American Veterinary Medical Association (past member)
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As the mom of 2 young kids and a veterinarian, I use my spare time as wisely as possible to volunteer and participate in my community. I currently volunteer with Adopt-a-Neighbor, a Fort Collins based volunteer group that took off during the COVID-19 pandemic. I advocate for the accessibility of veterinary care to the lowest income communities as a volunteer with Peace, Love and Paws in Denver. I volunteer my time as a veterinarian, and foster home, with Big Dogs Huge Paws, Inc, a giant breed dog rescue. While obtaining my MPH, I helped design the Disaster Animal Response Team (DART) based at the Larimer Humane Society, a team dedicated to animal disaster response and emergency sheltering during disasters in Larimer County. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe the heart of every democracy lies in impartial and fair voting laws and districts. As a former statistician employed by the United States Census Bureau, I believe I have a unique knowledge of the data and geography used by the Census Bureau and can meaningfully contribute to the creation of non-partisan districts based on already established geographic boundaries.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My current and former careers rely on collecting and interpreting data and facts. While we can all disagree, I believe there is common ground amongst every conversation and disagreement. In fact, I believe the common ground outweighs the discord in nearly every situation. As a veterinarian, half of my job is to listen to the human accompanying my patient to get their take on what is going on. I then synthesize that information with the data I have gathered though my own observations and tests. The owner(s) and I then discuss the findings to come up with a treatment plan that accomplishes several goals: it is good for the patient, it is attainable (financially and otherwise) for the owner, and allows for other options to be pursued if necessary. Daily I have to build consensus with at least one owner to provide the best care possible for my patients. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have extensive experience in analyzing data, specifically data from the U.S. Census Bureau. I was employed at Census Bureau Headquarters for 5 years and at the Denver Regional Census Center for 1 year. Most of that time was spent dealing with various stakeholders, both teaching others how to use Census data and  relaying the needs of the public to those at the Bureau who collected the data and created the data products. I currently work on a more individual level analyzing results of blood tests, radiographs, and other medical information to synthesize the data with my observations to best diagnose and treat my patients. I rely on doing research daily and regularly reaching out to specialists to provide the best care for my patients and their human owners. I strive to apply logical thinking in every facet of my life.
