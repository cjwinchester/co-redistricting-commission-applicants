        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Isaiah Spencer Martin</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Isaiah Spencer Martin
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Isaiah Spencer Martin</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Currently, I work as an inventory manager at a company called Safilo. We send and deliver various products for construction and outdoor recreation, and is considered an essential service. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in political science with a minor in ethnic studies, and during that time of the study, I had the opportunity to intern with the city manager of Englewood, Colorado during the summer of 2017.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80205
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
During the 2016 elections, I had helped local organizations in Denver, Colorado to get people in the community information about different ballot measures and getting people to make sure that they vote. During my time at CSU fort collins, I had also participated in different events to get students registered to vote, as well as, getting more attention on the government and the current political statuses in the united states.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Since December 2016, I have been a part of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity incorporated which not only worked for the advancement of college-educated black men and the greater black community. During November 2015 I also had the privilege to be apart of the Associated Students of Colorado State University. This was the school&#39;s student government which not only votes on student fees but many other student affairs that would help the experience of students at the campus. Before being officially accepted I was able to lobby the student government to create senate positions for the cultural centers on the campus and had the opportunity to become the first student senator to represent the Black and African American cultural center in the student government.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
During my time at Colorado State University, I was able to participate in multiple student groups to seek change. In 2014, I was able to participate in a sit-in for Trayvon martin. During my sophomore year (2015) I was able to participate in a protest and demonstration in support of Missouri university and the racist incidents towards the black community at the campus. During the year 2015, I was also able to lobby the student government with the fellow students in order to create senate positions for campus cultural centers, whilst simultaneously fundraising water and other resources to be sent to Flint, Michigan. Through the remainder of my college career, I was able to help with organizing multiple students on campus to not only talk to higher administration about our needs and contributing to our voice on campus.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I would like to serve on the commission not only to gain more political experience in Colorado but also to help make sure that moving forward from Donald Trump&#39;s presidency, we can guarantee the citizens of Colorado fair districts that will represent them fairly and make sure the peoples votes count. I would also like to be apart of this committee to have a clear voice for colorado natives and how we should be represented as the population of Denver, and the greater Colorado area are growing with new residents.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that with my experience I will be able to not only bring a different perspective to the commissioners, as well as bring a fresh perspective and new ideas to the commission due to my age and experience with organization and mobilization. I believe I will be able to contribute to the commissioners as well, by my ability to work with various people no matter the positions in order to achieve the common goals that we share for the people. Through my experience in ASCSU, I was not only able to work on my impartiality in order to work with senators who did not share the same opinions as me but was able to attain focus and problem-solving skills which I feel would be of great use to the commission.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Not only I am a hard-working young man, but due to my collegiate experience, I have developed skills in which I can handle organizational events and problems on the spot without much worry. These skills would further develop my abilities in being able to handle different situations on the spot, as well as, being able to communicate with different individuals to discuss the solutions to problems, as well as the problems themselves. With my collegiate and intern experience, I gained great organizational skills in which I not only learned how to handle, and work with large amounts of money, but to collect and make reports that would help give those who I was working with all of the information they needed to handle various problems.
