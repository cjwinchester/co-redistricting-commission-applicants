<h5>Zip Code</h5>

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I am a trained facilitator who has worked for 30 years to facilitate group process to best represent the needs of both the group and the people they represent. I have worked on diversity issues and inclusion and equity work across the state to center the voices that need to be heard. I currently work with three organizations that do work to represent and advocate for Coloradans - CIRC, Project Protect Food Systems, and The Community Remembrance Project. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been involved in politics as a volunteer since I was a child. I was pulled in a wagon to campaign against Nixon and have worked on various campaigns as a volunteer ever since.  I have given to Biden, Obama, Polis, and various state initiatives as well as MoveOn.Org and Swing Left.
</p>

In reverse order - Project Protect Food Systems, a state-wide organization for food security doing communications, The Race Justice Task Force of the Episcopal Church in Colorado as a leadership development volunteer, The Community Remembrance Project a volunteer working with youth, I have been on the Board of the Fyera Foundation for two years.

I am also involved in the Colorado Immigrants Rights Coalition as a trained observer and do facilitation pro-bono for groups who are doing visioning and diversity and inclusion work.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am a deeply optimistic believer in our governmental system. When I voted last year to create the commission, I knew I wanted to be on it to do a great job at what other states have mangled. I love Colorado and I have a lot of pride in how well we do a lot of things in this state, especially voting related. I want this to be one of the ways that Colorado is successful in taking good care of our citizens and in showing the country that it is possible to be fair minded, just, and forward-thinking. We are all those things and I want to see it come to fruition.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am trained by Columbia University School of Public Health, by Kaiser Permenente, The Restorative Justice Project, and several no-institutional training programs to facilitate group process. I am a deep believer in communication and consensus and know from 30 years of work in the field as well as being an educator how to make that happen, even in rooms where conflict is a big issue. I know how to participate in tough discussions and how to teach people to listen and process data even when triggered. It is what I wrote my dissertation on, and how I do my work every day. I would bring to this commission the skills of facilitation and group process and can be both a good participant and a resource.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have finished a PhD that includes qualitative data analysis. I am trained as an academic in how to teach and use critical thinking in humanities and social science disciplines. I also wrote a book on the use of communications skills to support data and quantitative information in decision making which is in the publication process, and a book for more general audiences on trauma aware communications skills that includes sections on using data. I am uniquely qualified to work on a hot topic with a divided group to create collegiality and success.
