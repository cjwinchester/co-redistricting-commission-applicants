<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Janine Kotre
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Asset Manager for Boulder County Housing Authority. Two resumes are attached.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I hold a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (1985). I have been a licensed, Employing Real Estate Broker in Colorado since 1994. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80304
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not donated to any political campaigns or other political organizations, nor participated in any political campaigns.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I was a volunteer, Court-Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) for Voices For Children in Boulder, Colorado. I held many civic, public and community advocate positions during my years in New Mexico. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Colorado Advocacy: As noted above, I have been a volunteer advocate for children who are part of the social service, justice system. As a court-appointed special advocate, I became a quasi-parent to children whose parents had been taken away from them. I represented the voice of the children in court to the judge, attorneys and child welfare workers. For four years, I spent 20 hours per week working in this role. Of special note is my part in writing the case to change state law which removed the power of the Guardian-Ad Litum to dismiss written or oral information that CASAs provide on behalf of the child, at their will. The law was amended to allow all information that a CASA collects and shares on behalf of the child to be submitted directly to the judge/magistrate. Since 2015, CASAs now have an equal seat at the table, which has served to make the children&#39;s voices heard. I have a much more diverse background organizing, advocating for and representing groups, organizations and associations during my time in New Mexico.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Earlier in my career, I spent much time working in public service at the state level as assistant to the Speaker of the House, on various economic development boards, and writing grants supporting Native American self sufficiency. I was very active at the local level in seeking entitlements for the development of large, public/private real estate projects. My training and skills allow me to hold the larger vision while working in extremely detailed environments to bring about desired change. All of these positions required heavy public participation and consensus building for projects ranging from city centers to the most rural and culturally-diverse communities. Public service has always been the most meaningful to me and I am always drawn to it. I work well under pressure, am extremely trustworthy and capable.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Strategies for promoting consensus start with meeting in person and listening. Everyone present needs to be heard. When there is disagreement, clearly identify why people disagree, which can be a lack of information, different personal values or past experience. Process work is important to move disagreement subtly from subjectivity to objectivity. Seeing specifically where parties disagree (without making anyone wrong) is a start, then identifying the common goal and the areas where people agree on the path to reaching the goal is the next step. Continue building objectivity by identifying alternative scenarios to the common goal (in writing) breaking down the steps necessary in reaching the goal. In areas where parties still disagree, a rating strategy may help from most to least popular and eliminating those that appear unlikely to arrive at the most likely option. I&#39;ve found that 9/10 of the work is done by this point. I would like to add that diplomacy, mutual respect and openness are critical for successful consensus building. People really need to feel like you have compassion and respect for them throughout the process, and beyond.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My background as a financial analyst in the field of real estate development, and my experience as a successful grant writer and administrator are indicative of my natural ability for logic and reasoning. For example, I have authored and administered over $500 million in large federal, state and local grants primarily for Native American populations, and in the area of land conservation throughout Colorado (see attached Grants resume&#39;). I have the ability to see the larger picture while being acutely attentive to the details. I have assisted in the development and management of over $1 billion in commercial real estate, lending the experience to navigating through complex environments working in partnership with teams of individuals/firms to reach a common goal.
