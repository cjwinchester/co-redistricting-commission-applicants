<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
During my 25 years with Project Self-Sufficiency (1989-2014) my focus was on assisting low-income single parents as they moved from poverty to financial independence. I continue to have relationships with many of the parents who either graduated from the program or participated in services during my years there. I often serve as a mentor and write letters of recommendation. As Executive Director I represented our organization at the Women&#39;s Foundation of Colorado in Denver, attending advocacy meetings and helping with research projects. I also coordinated services with other community based organizations here in Larimer County. During the years of Welfare Reform I was very active at the State and Local levels in advocating for families living in poverty. While Executive Director, I also served as Program Manager as we did not add that position until later. I expended a good deal of creative energy and networked extensively to establish programs for single parents like the Cars for Families program and special child care and scholarship funds. I sought out partners like the fleet services staff at Larimer County, the City of Fort Collins, and Aims Community College to arrange for volunteer car repair. I worked closely with local housing authorities to secure rent subsidies for families in the PS-S program. I developed quite a local and even statewide reputation and received a number of awards mentioned in my resume.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am currently assisting with phone calling for the Harris-Biden Campaign and assisted Gordon McLaughlin for DA Eighth Judicial District with yard sign delivery. During the primary I helped gather signatures for Kim Akeley Charron for Larimer County Commissioner and for Lorena Garcia for US Senate. In prior years I have assisted with distribution of literature and phone calling for various campaigns. I attend all caucuses and in recent months I have participated in online townhalls and Democratic Party meetings over zoom and other web platforms. I am currently donating funds about once a month to 25 to 30 different local, statewide, and national campaigns usually at the $25 level and occasionally up to $75.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have consistently been a volunteer for Project Self-Sufficiency of Loveland-Fort Collins since retiring from that organization in November 2014. I was Executive Director for 25 years. Since leaving employment there, I have continued on the Scholarship Committee and meet periodically with my successor as well as helping out with newsletter articles and special events. After leaving Project Self-Sufficiency, I worked for the Colorado State University School of Social Work for three years placing undergraduate and graduate level students into internships with organizations around the State. Since retiring from CSU, I have continued to serve as a volunteer Field Instructor for various Larimer County organizations accepting students. As recently as May 2020, I was the Field Instructor for two social work students at Alternatives to Violence in Loveland. I have been serving on the Board of Directors for the Sam S. Bloom Foundation (based out of Centennial, Colorado) for over six years and chair two committees. We distribute grants to nonprofit organizations around the State of Colorado. In recent months, I served on a Larimer County advisory committee distributing federal COVID funds to local organizations. We made recommendations after reviewing funding requests.  I have also volunteered with the City of Loveland, helping with resource distribution for people experiencing homelessness. The attached resume provides some additional information on my experience and service over the years.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
While employed in leadership positions it did not seem feasible for me to take on responsibilities such as this one. My whole adult life I have wanted to be more involved in public service at a governmental level. I was asked to run for office on a couple of occasions and decided against it. Since retirement, I have evolved to a place where I am ready to dedicate myself to something special and different. I am a bit of a “policy wonk” and when I voted on the ballot initiatives that created these commissions, I was already thinking about how I could get involved once the process began. I heard about All on the Line and attended one of their trainings in Fort Collins. I was impressed by Olivia Mendoza and became really excited about applying for the commissions. I believe I have the temperament, experience, and skills to play a valuable role as a commission member. I am also dedicated to seeing our State be successful as we take on this cutting edge and forward thinking process that can become a model to the rest of the country for creating fair and just representation within government.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My social work education and many years of experience have helped me build a skill set that would assist with this process. As a nonprofit leader, it has often been my goal and my role to build consensus by finding common interests and concerns among participating individuals and organizations. Digging deep to identify my own personal experiences that relate to the topic at hand, as well as helping others do the same, creates an opportunity to build consensus. Story telling and other real life examples of how people are affected is often an effective tool. It is important to see beyond the obvious and look for unintended consequences. I would listen to all points of view and differing opinions, especially coming from local communities and special populations that would be impacted. It is critical to consider diversity within populations, issues that bind communities together, and special circumstances experienced by varying communities. I am rather obsessive about fairness and go to great lengths to make sure a process is fair. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt while gathering more information. We each need to look at our own potential biases and rise above those. In my leadership role at Project Self-Sufficiency, I was known for my inclusive and demographic style of decision making. I worked closely with staff and board members, while also seeking input from program participants. While serving as an Election Judge for Larimer County in 2018, I worked side by side with Republicans and Unaffiliated coworkers to successfully review the status of individual voters at a polling place.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I tend to be a cautious thinker, looking closely at the details in any situation, considering worst and best case scenarios, anticipating unintended consequences, and looking at the long term effects of decisions made now. I continue to marvel at the forethought New Yorkers exhibited when they created Central Park so many years ago. I like to do research and look at best practices to discover ideas and examples of what can work and under what circumstances. My mother was an amazing problem solver and could rig up the most fascinating solutions to a practical problem. I have tried to learn from her example. I look at common sense solutions as well as the spirit of the law.
