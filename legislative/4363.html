<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Donated between $25 and $75 to the following candidates in 2020: Joe Biden, John Hickenlooper, Judy Amabile, Diane Mitsch Bush, Karl Hanlon, Jaime Harrison, Joe Neguse. I also volunteered for approximately 3 weeks as part of Colorado Fair Share Action&#39;s Neighborhood Vote Project between Mid-October and November 3rd, 2020.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have had no membership to any political, civic, or community organizations since November 10, 2015.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My direct experience with organizing, representing, advocating for, or considering the interests of groups, organizations, or associations in Colorado is minimal, but I am still familiar with it. As part of Colorado Fair Share Action&#39;s Neighborhood Vote Project I made calls to help voters that hadn&#39;t voted regularly make vote plans for the 2020 election. This project was in support of democratic candidates, but not authorized or endorsed by any candidates or committees. Additionally, I served as an adult volunteer for Colorado&#39;s Youth In Goverment program which teaches high school students about the government by guiding them through a mock legislature. Each student is assigned a role such as representative, press, lobbyist, judge, etc. This mock legislature brought together teens from all over Colorado and it was my duty as an adult volunteer to ensure that each student knew their role, knew what the other roles were, and knew how to work with others whose views and opinions may differ from their own.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to ensure that districts are representative of the people who live in them and do not favor one political group over another. It is crucial that every vote has the same weight and every voter has the opportunity to elect representatives who can best represent them, their community, and their district as a whole. By serving on this commission, I could further exercise my civic duty beyond just voting to ensure the preservation of principles and ideals that lead to the perpetuation of democracy on a local, state, and national scale.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that consensus can be reached as long as people are approaching a common goal, regardless of the angle they are coming from. I know that everyone will have biases, and that people will be at various points of confronting them. When a group of different-minded people are brought together, differences of opinion (especially regarding politics) quickly become apparent. As a summer camp director, I consistently deal with people who disagree with one another and serve as a mediator to find common ground and, if necessary, hold someone accountable for wrongdoings. With this redistricting process, any overt attempts to favor one party over another will be obvious and I have no issue addressing such attempts even if I may be in favor of them. Additionally, I am personally aware of my own biases and how my lived experience impacts how I see the world, but it is this acknowledgement of my biases that makes it easier to identify them, set them aside, and proceed impartially.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
When approaching a problem, I often try to quantify variables as best as I can. Utilizing facts, figures, and numbers is something that just makes sense to me and I regularly use spreadsheets to help me find patterns, identify outliers, and make sense of things. Statistics, logic, and reason make sense to me and will prevent outside motivations and emotions from having an influence on my decisions. I also believe that my natural ability to interpret data and figures and translate that into conclusions for myself and other members is something that would make me a valuable asset to this commission. Additionally, I feel comfortable addressing fallacies put forth whether its an ad hominem attack, strawman, false dichotomy, hasty generalization, etc. and explaining why such a statement or action is not logical.
