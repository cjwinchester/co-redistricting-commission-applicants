        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Ginger Barrett</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Ginger Barrett
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Ginger Wolf-Ekblad (maiden name)</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Currently self-employed, part-time, as a children&#39;s books consultant for Usborne Books &amp; More.

</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a Master&#39;s Degree in Elementary Education from Regis University, and earned my BA at CU Boulder, in English Literature.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80401
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I have not done this type of work on any large scale.  However, I work very hard to seek out and understand many perspectives on societal issues that I encounter.  I was also on my HOA board in Denver back in 2014, so had to do my best to represent the needs of all owners in that capacity.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I definitely lean liberal and Democrat, though I was registered as Independent for several years.  I believe it is incredibly important to vote, and that civic engagement is crucial in a Democracy.  As I recall, I donated to Obama&#39;s campaign in 2012, and I definitely contributed to Amy McGrath&#39;s campaign in Kentucky this year, but I believe those are the only times I&#39;ve contributed directly to a person&#39;s campaign.  I&#39;ve otherwise donated to activities to increase voter turnout: this election, I supported MoveOn.org&#39;s voter turnout efforts.  Those are all the donations I can remember.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I attended Foothills Parks &amp; Recreation&#39;s South Jeffco Business Alliance meetings regularly throughout 2019, as an Usborne Books &amp; More consultant; and this year I made calls to voters as a volunteer for the Colorado Democratic Party.  I also attended a few School Advisory Committee meetings at my local elementary school, when my son was in preschool there last year.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Districting is incredibly important to our Democracy, and when it is done without proper study and understanding -- or worse, with malicious intent to disenfranchise people and thus retain power unethically -- I believe that it hurts everyone.  I want to serve on the commission because I believe that I can contribute thoughtfully to creating districts that are as fair for every voter as possible.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that finding consensus among a group of commissioners that seeks fair representation for everyone in Colorado should be relatively straightforward.  In the event of facing a decision that involves trade-offs somehow, I would do my best to refer to the data and encourage others to do the same.  It is the data, the voters, and the extent to which each vote matters (which we should be maximizing), that should guide decision-making and help us to find consensus.
Fairness has always been incredibly important to me.  As the youngest child of three, I felt that much in my life was unfair, and from that I learned how to empathize and also how to work with others to find solutions that work for everyone -- so as to not leave them behind, as I had often felt left behind as a child.  While I realize that life itself is certainly not fair, we, as a commission with the intention of drawing fair districts for our state, should strive for fairness -- for making each vote count as best we can, regardless of who is casting it.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am someone who analyzes just about everything, and picks apart what I read.  I check sources, seek out faulty logic, and criticize lop-sided and poorly-researched arguments.  If I don&#39;t know about something that I want to discuss, I go and learn about it first.  Government matters should not ever be about personal preferences, but about how best to serve the constituents.  It should be based on data, reason, and empowering the people.
