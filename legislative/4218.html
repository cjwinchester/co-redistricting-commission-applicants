</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I feel strongly that current gerrymandering practices are detrimental to our democracy resulting in the disenfranchisement of voters. It allows our elected officials to disregard voting minorities in their districts resulting in policy initiatives that do not address the needs of all of our citizens. I support the creation of independent redistricting commissions and now that I am retired, I would like to contribute to this important endeavor. I believe that my background and skills make me a good candidate to contribute to this effort.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have years of experience working in organizations with people of different backgrounds and viewpoints. As both a career and a volunteer manager, I have been responsible for communicating ideas and initiatives and gaining the buy-in necessary to achieve goals. Sometimes in high stress or otherwise adverse situations. I have a strong value of honest dealings and plain talk and that has served me well throughout my career and volunteer work.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As my references will confirm, I am able to dissect complex problems and identify the issues creating disfunction or discord. I am capable of digging into details of technical problems within my area of expertise and creating solutions. I have designed business processes and policies for a number of organizations that comply with government regulations in the most efficient way possible. I am a competent computer user; conversant in accounting and financial analysis and investment software as well as highly technical digital photographic processing software. I was responsible for negotiating and managing the sale of the engineering firm where I worked and was a co-owner. Subsequent to the sale, I managed the integration of our business into the purchasers organization. I also managed the integration of additional purchased business into the new regional organization. I have no doubt that my work experience along with my innate abilities at communication provide me with the skills and discipline required to serve well on the redistricting commission.
