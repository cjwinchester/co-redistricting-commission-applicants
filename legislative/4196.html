<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have voted in every election since 18 year-olds achieved the right to vote in 1972.  As the Executive Director of the New Mexico Math Engineering Science Achievement , I spoke at hearings of the NM Legislative Education Study Committee as part of the process a funding bill for statewide pre-college program. As the Student Council Sponsor for a middle of 900, I worked with the county to conduct our school election using their voting machines. Additionally, I have conducted lessons with middle school students reviewing the ticker-tape printed results posted on the door of the school polling place.  During this 2020 election, I donated to the La Plata LEague of Women Voters to help support their election education efforts.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
La Plata League of Women Voters, Bayfield 10-JT-R School District Board of Directors, Supporting Member of KSUT Public Radio
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
From 2010-2015, I represented the teachers in Archuleta, LA Plata and Montezuma counties on the Gifted Education Forum as part of an effort to facilitate two-way communication among statewide gifted educators and the Colorado Department of Education (CDE).  Working with representatives from our Colorado institutions of higher education, I also served on the CDE Post-Secondary and Workforce Readiness state assessment revision committee.  Additionally, I currently serve on the Colorado Association of School Board’s statewide Legislative Resolutions Committee.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I became aware of the Colorado Independent Redistricting Commissions as a result of my role which involves keeping our Bayfield 10-Jt-R School Board apprised of state and federal legislation that may impact our district in the near or distant future. I believe serving on the commission would support and enhance my board work.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In the late sixties, I attended parochial schools.  During that time my teacher assigned our class the task of debating the pros and cons of three controversial topics: Abortion, Capital Punishment, and the Vietnam War.  This life-changing experience taught me to research and be able to convincingly state the main points of differing opinions on opposite sides of an issue.  When I turned 18 and received the right to vote, I registered as unaffiliated to help me maintain independent thinking so as to not be swayed by partisan rhetoric while researching the merits of arguments for and against.  Additionally I have training in communication and bringing groups to consensus through Landmark Worldwide coursework, which is offered in 26 countries.  I have also served as a Landmark “Self-Expression and Leadership” coach for course attendees in New Mexico.  As a result, I believe my experiences and training would be valuable as the commission works to reach consensus.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Analytical skill is the ability to deconstruct information into smaller categories so as to draw conclusions. This skill requires critical thinking, logical reasoning, research, data analysis and effective communication. I have taught high school Algebra and Geometry courses, as well as undergraduate Algebra and Statistics coursework. Each of these mathematical disciplines requires teachers to model and promote the development and application of analytical skill.  As a mathematics teacher with strong analytical thinking skills, I am capable of quickly analyzing a situation, topic or problem, and can work well in a team setting to accomplish goals. This is exactly the work of the commission will be tasked to complete.
