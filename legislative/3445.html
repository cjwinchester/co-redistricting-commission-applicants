<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am an active Democrat. Over the past five years I have registered voters (2016), and worked as a Slack Text Team Leader (2020) for the Colorado Democrats.  This involved texting voters in Colorado about the Presidential, state and county elections. The main responsibility as a Leader was to help the  folks who were texting voters usingThruText as the vehicle for communication with voters and Slack for communicating with the leaders and the staff. The main responsibilities were to answer questions about the procedure and provide resources to help voters who had questions about the candidates and the issues. I worked remotely an average of 3 hours/day form August 19th through November 3rd. I also spent considerable time researching issues and candidates to prepare for my role as Text Team Leader.

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Democratic Party, Habitat for Humanity, University Hills Neighborhood Association 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I am a retired elementary school principal. I held administrative positions for 14 years as an assistant principal (7 years) and principal (7 years) in both Texas and Jefferson County Schools (CO). Those jobs required excellent listening, synthesizing, and conflict resolution skills. A major part of the job was to plan, compromise and  reach consensus towards a common goal. I believe those skills would serve me well as a member of the Colorado Redistricting Commission. 
I also have a good sense of humor and have a daily meditation practice.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have been very concerned about gerrymandering in our country. This system is designed with non-democratic goals in mind. I believe the voice of the people are  central to  a vibrant and honest democracy. I would be honored to work toward this end in Colorado.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As stated above, my experience as a principal is very relevant to this position. The education of children does not lay in neutral territory. Elementary education is one of the few fields in which everyone has past experience - either as a student, parent, teacher, or citizen. A principal is must respond to and work collaboratively with all of these constituents in order to be successful.
I also think serving on a jury is relevant experience, My peers on a jury came with very different views and life experiences. I found it revealing and helpful to work with people outside of my usual bubble.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I believe analytical skills require facts and unbiased approaches to reach good decisions. As a principal. I have disaggregated student achievement data to form the basis of my decisions. Following that data down to a plan for each studentâ€™s success should be clear and tangible. One of the things I am most proud of is using this data directly with students. Teachers met with each of their students to review his/her testing results, then helped him/her write achievable short term goals and ways to measure those goals during the year.
I believe technology can also play an important role in this work and I am comfortable using this tool.
