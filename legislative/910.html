<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
When I arrived in Washington, DC, there were two women working in the government affairs area.  One worked for the railroads and the other was with the International Ladies’ Garment Workers of America.  Those of us being hired for similar positions had few mentors.  We needed direction.  Twelve of us in the food industry founded Women in Government Relations.  Monthly luncheons featured effective speakers who gave us confidence and professional guidance.  For example, Elizabeth Dole spoke at a luncheon when she was serving on the Federal Trade Commission.  We shared books on effective management.  Our first salary survey resulted in 15 women getting raises after they presented the data to their bosses and demonstrated they were underpaid.  My work with the Front Range Community College Foundation includes writing pieces some of which emphasize the importance of scholarships in graduating skilled employees who meet Colorado businesses’ needs and how important they are to the state’s economy.  I gave an endowment to the college for needed equipment for students enrolled in our new Center for Integrated Manufacturing programs.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I was a volunteer in Dianne Primavera’s last campaigns for election and reelection to Colorado’s House of Representatives.  I worked on writing projects for Noel Ginsburg’s Colorado gubernatorial campaign in 2018.  I have contributed to the campaigns of John Hickenlooper, Jason Crow, Joe Biden/Kamala Harris, Jaime Harrison, Amy McGrath, Mark Kelly, Steve Bullock, and Jared Polis/Dianne Primavera.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the commission because I want to make a difference.  I want to make a difference for Colorado voters.  As Booker T. Washington noted, “Those who are happiest are those who do the most for others” 

And, what can we do for others that is more important than ensure Colorado’s voters are fairly represented in our state’s Congressional and state districts?  The doctrine—one person, one vote—requires that electoral districts be apportioned fairly and accurately.  The 2021 redistricting of Colorado is extremely important.  Our state’s population has grown over the last 10 years.  Based on new census data, Colorado could gain an addition seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.  That would expand our state’s influence in national politics and increase federal funding for state projects.  Redistricting also impacts representation of Colorado’s growing diversity.  

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My Washington, DC, experiences and the various positions I held were centered on finding consensus among members of these organizations with different points of view and varying political perspectives.  I could not have succeeded without being fair and impartial.  I have never worked for any organization where I did not discuss issues with a team in the course of making a decision.  It varied from working with the Board to working with members of a committee.  Yes, I analyzed the issue, researched it, and crafted a recommendation.  But, it was only through consensus that a decision was reached.  Cognitive empathy is essential in coming to any agreement.  Active listening is effective.  It requires listening attentively and paraphrasing what has been said in any response, underscoring that you have heard and understand the point being made by another team member.  I socialize monthly with a neighbor who supports the opposite political party.  I bring up many, many subjects for discussion on which I know we can agree as caring women.  It underscores that we all have more we can agree on than disagree on in this sadly divisive time.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
You cannot successfully run an organization without realistic budgeting.  You cannot successfully run a homeowners association without realistic budgeting and sufficient reserves for the future.  You cannot chair an Investment Committee without a Board-approved investment policy.  You cannot hire a new investment manager without a Request for Proposal.  You cannot look forward without thoughtful strategic planning.  No new challenge is unsurmountable.  You analyze.  You do research.  You learn.  You get it done.  While head of the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums, mediation was rarely needed.   But, a few situations demanded it.  A member was doing or saying something to the media that embarrassed another member.  Changing behavior and coming to an agreement takes patience, empathy, and persuasive skills.  
And, then there is communication.  A messaging strategy is the key to successfully marketing a business, a product, a political campaign, or a new concept, as well as effectively meeting both professional and personal goals and objectives.  The Front Range Community College Foundation depends on generous, caring donors to fund scholarships for needy students and capital improvements.  I draft many funding requests for Foundation staff to distribute.  The challenge is to understand your audience, analyze their motivations, and identify what has value and will motivate a potential donor to give.  This has been especially important during this pandemic, which caused students to lose their part-time jobs and their parents to lose their jobs and businesses.  The Foundation created a High Needs Fund for both students and adjunct instructors.  Many needed help, which required constant fundraising.  It was very rewarding when donors reacted positively and we could help so many students continue their educations.  One story we told often is that of a single mom who lost her job because of Covid.  She could no longer afford her apartment.  She moved in with her grandparents.  Because they are elderly, she could not search for another job, fearing if she brought the virus home they could die.  She needed help paying basic bills once she lost her income.  Booker T. Washington’s words ring very true when helping FRCC students reach for their dreams.
