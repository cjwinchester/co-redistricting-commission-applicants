<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I moved to Colorado to run the Office of Sustainability for the Denver Mayor in 2017. In this role, I worked across government departments and in collaboration with Denver neighborhoods to improve natural resource conservation measures. I represented the City and County of Denver to the broader community and among other municipal governments across the country working toward similar goals. 
 
For three years, I organized a coalition of 40 Colorado Jewish organizations, working to represent the broad Jewish community on local, state, and federal policy issues of relevance and impact to this Colorado constituency. 
 
On a neighborhood level, I organized monthly magazines for the residents of Denver&#39;s Hilltop and Lowry neighborhoods for four years, working closely with residents and neighborhood groups, to share news of interest to the community. That work led to playing a similar role for the Denver metro Realtor community, and I currently run this industry trade publication. My role is to help build relationships between top producing Realtors and local businesses that service the real estate industry. 
 
For the past two years, I have been an active parent at Eldorado PK-8, serving on the PTO and School Accountability Committee. When COVID jeopardized the 5th-grade commencement festivities, I organized a Netflix Movie Night for the 5th-grade class. I convened a group of parents to help set up the technology, design gift bags, and organized delivery of gift bags to each 5th-grade household. I am currently organizing a pandemic-friendly safe Halloween program for children in the Rock Creek neighborhood. My neighborhood involvement has also included advocacy work to prevent gun violence in our community and keep our children safe. 

</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
From 2001-2003, I served as a political campaign consultant in San Francisco for local and state candidates and ballot initiatives. Since 2015, I have contributed to Our Colorado Way of Life and Governor John Hickenlooper&#39;s Gubernatorial Campaign.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The development of drawing new boundaries for elected official districts is a critical piece of democracy. Ensuring these boundaries are developed fairly with equal representation for each demographic sector of our state&#39;s communities is by the far the most important and critical component of ensuring democracy is working effectively for everyone. It would be an absolute honor to contribute to this enormous and essential task. As an active community member in various Denver and Boulder county neighborhoods, schools, and Jewish community organizations across Colorado, I have a unique perspective on working with many different sectors of our Colorado community which I believe would greatly contribute to the commission&#39;s work. 

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have been involved in community organizing and coalition building for 25 years, both professionally and as a volunteer. I pride myself on approaching coalition work with an open mind and a kind heart. I find it is always more effective to approach a disagreement among team members with respect and the ability to empathize with opposing views than to try to argue and intimidate others to get your way. In fact, I have been known in many situations as the team player who stays calm and is able to create agreement and effectively help reach consensus.  
 

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My professional experience in communications has given me several tools in strategic analysis, problem solving, investigation and consensus-building. As the managing editor of publications, I thoroughly edit all stories submitted, including fact-checking for accurate representation. My role with the Jewish Community Relations Council and several past coalition organizer roles I have played required mediation and consensus-building to develop strategic plans and public messaging on behalf of issues and causes. I enjoy working in teams and often lead collaboration opportunities to optimize efforts at the community level. As an involved parent in my community as well as in my professional roles, I serve as a project manager to prioritize goals and execute various programs.
