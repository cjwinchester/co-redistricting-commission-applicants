</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am active in state and national politics. In my personal life, I am a Democrat and support numerous state and national Democratic candidates, including fundraisers in my home. Professionally, I am non-partisan and support both Republican and Democrats who support patient safety and physician causes. I donate to several non-partisan PACs, including the PAC for the American Society of Anesthesiologists and I help organize the PACs for the Colorado Society of Anesthesiologists. These PACs support both Republican and Democratic candidates for the political office.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am a Board Member of the Colorado Medical Board, tasked with regulating the practice of medicine in all of Colorado. In addition, I am an active member of the Colorado Society of Anesthesiologists which represents the interests of patients and physicians in Colorado and helps advocate for patient safety and the highest quality of medical care. I have previously held leadership positions within the society and currently represent Colorado anesthesiologists in the American Society of Anesthesiologists. As an expert in opioid medications and pain management, I participate in the Colorado Consortium for Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention which helps coordinate Colorado’s response to the opioid crisis.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I am an actively involved in organized medicine in Colorado, helping to represent widely different perspectives and priorities among physicians throughout the state. I currently help organize the my specialty society’s advocacy, legislative, and educational mission with an aim to be representative and inclusive to these widely different perspectives. I have helped spearhead our specialty’s involvement in the opioid crisis, medication safety, and social justice missions. I represent our state society within the American Society of Anesthesiologists, making sure the interests of Colorado patients and physicians are represented within the larger mission of perioperative specialists in the United States.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I’m excited to participate in a Constitutionally mandated process, which many citizens never get the opportunity to do. My goal is to make sure the citizens of Colorado have a fair and equitable creation of legislative districts in our representative government. Finally, it would be an honor to make sure LatinX Coloradans are represented in a process that in the past has been significantly partisan and may not have appropriately represented this community.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my role as an advocate for medicine, I frequently have to engage members of the public as well as physicians, regulators, and legislators with opposing political and policy points of view, bring them to the table, show them the facts and the data, and help them compromise and come to a consensus. A key to that process is discovering people’s common goals and facilitating solutions which help them meet these goals - at the most basic level, I listen, I ask questions, I present information and I try to create understanding between participants.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
On a daily basis as a physician, scientist, and educator, I have to assimilate and analyze data to solve complex patient care problems. Reading and applying scientific studies, deciphering multi variable systems, and creating evidence based solutions is how I was trained to solve problems in medicine. This training has served me in areas of my life outside of medicine as well, and I believe that I will have prepared me well to be a commissioner.
