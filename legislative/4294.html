        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Shawn Robinson</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Shawn Robinson
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Shawn Allen Robinson</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Mathematics teacher, Aspen High School, Aspen, CO 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have BS and MS degrees in mathematices from Emory University and a PhD degree in mathematics from the University of North Carolina.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81623
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have neither donated to nor done work, paid or volunteer, for any campaign or organization in the past 32 years. I did volunteer work for a local Republican congressional candidate in 1988, when I was 18 years old. I have been a registered voter without party affiliation for at least the past 10 years -- probably longer, but I can&#39;t recall.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Member of the Colorado Education Association (2017-present); Treasurer and board member of the Powderhorn Racing Club, a youth ski club in Mesa County, CO (2016)
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have served on the Aspen School District Insurance Committee from 2019 to present. We survey members&#39; needs and preferences, solicit proposals, and negotiate contracts for the district&#39;s employee insurance plan. This work requires finding balance between competing desires of the members and optimizing their cost/coverage within the constraint of the district budget and risk tolerance. With the Powderhorn Racing Club I managed a small budget (typically less than $200,000 per annum) and was responsible for fee collection, club expenses, payroll, tax records, and insurance. I also served as the vice chair of the Colorado Mesa University assessment committee from 2015 to 2016. This committee was charged with designing reporting instruments, collecting and reviewing data, and auditing individual programs with respect to their academic missions.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have always believed that having sitting legislators draw district boundaries is an enormous conflict interest, and a serious obstacle to increasing fairness and transparency in our democracy. I am proud of Colorado for putting redistricting in the hands of an independent commission, and I would love to serve our state without involving myself in party politics. I also think redistricting is an interesting problem and believe my mathematical expertise would be valuable to the commission.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I view the redistricting process primarily as a mathematical constrained optimization problem, and as such my approach would be completely impartial. The criteria and priorities for the map have already been stated, and the role of the commission is simply to find a map that maximizes the combined &quot;values&quot; of the priorities. Of course, it is unlikely that all commissioners would have such a technical and objective view, and part of my duty would be to explain the technical details in a way that people could understand easily and appreciate as neutral and transparent. This is similar to what I do every day as a public school teacher. I expect the work of the redistricting commission will have a lot in common with my recent work on my school district&#39;s insurance committee -- studying data, finding common priorities within a diverse constituency through surveys and debates, constructing a plan to maximize the fullfillment of those priorities within constraints, and then clearly and empathetically communicating the results to the constituents -- many of whom don&#39;t understand insurance well, and all of whom care passionately about their health plan. This has been the most enjoyable committee work of my career, and I think my skills and temperment would apply equally well to the redistricing commission.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I worked as a research mathematician at Rutgers University from 2001 to 2004 and as a college professor of mathematics from 2007 to 2016. As I stated in a previous question, I see the redistricting task as a well-defined mathematical optimization problem that is ammenable to standard computational techniques.
