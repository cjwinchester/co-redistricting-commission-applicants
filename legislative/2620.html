<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have worked on multiple efforts to get better representation for citizens, in most cases, in nonpartisan races. From 2015-2019, I advocated for pro-public education candidates for Douglas County School Board, pushing back against school board members who were not transparent or accountable to the public. I joined an existing nonpartisan group and quickly fell into a manegerial role. The candidates we supported were Republican, Democrat, and Unaffiliated. I have organized volunteers in various roles, personally and professionally, for two decades.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I feel strongly that gerrymandering is damaging to representative democracy. I live in two heavily gerrymandered districts - CD6 and HD39. We worked hard to elect a representative who would listen to constituents and strive to represent their wishes in CD6. We were able to elect Jason Crow, who is proud of his many town halls and the way he listens to and represents all constituents, regardless of political affiliation. In HD39, because our district is gerrymandered to be a give-away to the Republican party, my representative doesn&#39;t feel he needs to listen to his constituents at all. However, when I spoke to him at the Capitol last year, I asked what bills he was working on that I might want to support. He looked stunned and said he had never thought about that. This year, he sponsored a nonpartisan, common-sense bill that is the sort of good governance we all want to see. I like to think my comment made a difference. I believe that all voters want leaders who listen and good public policy for the common good. People are tired of partisanship and divisiveness and want good governance from people who represent everyone.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a Democrat in a leadership role living in a heavily Republican area, I have spent years listening to people who have a different perspective than mine, and seeking common ground. As candidate for county commissioner, my treasurer was a Republican, and many of my strongest supporters were Unaffiliated and Republican neighbors. I have a lot of experience finding consensus as a mother of three and as a small business owner as well.
