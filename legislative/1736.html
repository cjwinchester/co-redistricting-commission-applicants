        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Alycia Tulloch Murray</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Alycia Tulloch Murray
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Maiden name: Alycia Anne Tulloch;  my current voter ID from the SOS site is 8392130</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a substitute librarian in the Boulder Public Library system; however, I was laid off in the summer. In the past 10 years, I have primarily worked at home and volunteered at my child&#39;s schools; however, in addition to substituting in the Boulder Public Library system, I also served as a substitute librarian in the Jefferson County Library system.  I was also employed for a semester in the Boulder Valley School district.  Most of my volunteering outside of my son&#39;s school has centered on work with Great Education Colorado and understanding and explaining how the Tabor and Gallagher Amendments, in particular, affect the funding of Colorado&#39;s public school system (and all public services in the state).  I have also volunteered with the I Have A Dream Foundation in Boulder County. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a Master of Library Science and a B.A. in History with a minor in Political Science. I am a notary public in Colorado.  
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80305
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have campaigned for numerous ballot issues in Colorado related to public education funding in the last three years with Great Education Colorado. In the most recent election, I sent texts encouraging voters to vote yes on B and EE and no on 116 and 117. In addition to periodic small donations to Great Education Colorado, I recently made small donations to Joe Biden&#39;s campaign and State Rep. Lisa Cutter&#39;s campaign.  I also believe that I made a small donation in the last several years to Colorado Speaker of the House K.C. Becker and I may have donated to the Gov. Polis campaign. Finally, I would likely have made small donations to the Hillary Clinton campaign. (If it&#39;s important to have an exact accounting of all of this, please let me know.) 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have been a member of the Mesa Elementary PTO, the Southern Hills Middle School PTO, the American Library Association, and a volunteer with Great Education Colorado and the I Have a Dream Foundation. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As I mentioned above, I have campaigned for numerous ballot issues in Colorado related to public education funding in the last three years with Great Education Colorado. Activities included &quot;testifying&quot; in front the Joint Budget Committee in 2018, writing op-ed pieces, gathering signatures, and texting voters. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I was very happy that the voters of Colorado approved anti-gerrymandering with Amendments Y and Z! These amendments seem to be such common sense, which I like to believe my home state prides itself in. What a nonsensical and unfair system to have the party in power at the time right after the census to be able to affect elections for the next 10 years (until the next census)! We are a proud purple state (more blue now, but still with plenty of red) and I truly want everyone&#39;s vote to count. While surely the commission process won&#39;t be perfect, I appreciate that there are definite criteria for creating districts and that redistricting will follow these definite criteria to try to make districts more &quot;rational&quot; and less political.  Obviously, with Colorado picking up a new House seat soon, redistricting is all the more important this time around. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have always been a consensus-builder, first in my family, then with my friends, then in school politics and then in the workplace. I try hard at understanding the other point of view when a situation is contentious. Further, I look out for the people who aren&#39;t being heard and loop them back into the conversation.  I understand that each criteria in forming a district is not completely concrete, but these criteria aren&#39;t entirely squishy either. This will help tremendously in deflecting personal opinion and stances, I believe. Further, you are looking for people to serve on this commission who appreciate the process and believe, fundamentally, that no matter what, districting should be impartial and that the voters of Colorado who approved Amendments Y and Z have asked this commission to make this happen! Will it be completely painless for me to know that certain districts are strongly red and will remain so? No; however, that doesn&#39;t mean I am not committed to a fair and impartial process. I am completely committed to that. Here is one example that explains my ability to be impartial: as a reference librarian,  I never comment or try to influence what someone is wanting to research; if the person wants to find out about the hunting seasons for quail, turkey and elk in Colorado, as well as which animals you can hunt with a crossbow or rifle, I find that information and deliver it to them in a professional, friendly manner. That I am a vegetarian, don&#39;t like hunting and don&#39;t like guns or crossbows has absolutely no bearing on how I treat the person or the work.   
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I love using disparate pieces of information to get a complete picture of a situation.  This is one of the reasons that I&#39;m a reference librarian... I want to complete the picture for patrons with complex problems (and I get to learn in the process, which enjoy).  I am a great listener and ask  good questions. I also seek the holes in arguments and can poke at them (in a very diplomatic way).  On a different note, I am not afraid to say that I don&#39;t understand something or that I need clarification; in other words, my ego does not get in the way of asking experts.  I live my life naturally analyzing complex situations; that is what has kept me happy cognitively while mostly focusing on being a mom.  Most recently I answered this complex question: Would the use of dry hydrogen peroxide technology in HVAC filtering systems be a feasible way to assure jittery teachers and get the most vulnerable students back to in-person learning in public school? After reading extensively, asking many questions, consulting experts, working with different stakeholders and considering a bunch of variables, I, along with state and local health officials and local school officials came to the conclusion that it was not feasible during this part of the pandemic.
