<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
To the best of my recollection, I made the following political contributions since 2015.  It is probable that I have contributed to more than just these candidates, but these are all that I recall:
Steve O’Doriso (Adams  County Commissioner)
Lynn Baca (Adams County Commissioner)
Eva Henry (Adams County Commissioner)
Chaz Tedesco (Adams County Commissioner)
Emma Pinter (Adams County Commissioner)
Jamie Torres (Denver City Council)
Michael Hancock (Mayor of Denver)
Jason Crow (U.S. Congress)
Shannon Bird (State Representative)
Paul Lopez (Clerk &amp; Recorder of Denver)
Joe Salazar (candidate for Attorney General)
Robert Rodriguez (State Senator)
Alex Valdez (State Representative)
Brian Mason (Adams County District Attorney)
Phil Weiser (Attorney General)
Alexis Menocal (Candidate for Denver School Board)
Diane Romero Campbell (Candidate for Denver School Board)
In addition to these political contributions, I have been an informal advisor and volunteer for State Senator Robert Rodriguez as well as Adams County Commissioner Steve O’Dorisio.  I have also volunteered for the Democratic Party as an election day legal observer for Adams County.  I have also been involved with the Democratic Latino Initiative.

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I serve as a Trustee for Colorado College and I am Secretary of the Board.  Prior to becoming Secretary of the Board, I was Chair of the Governance Committee of the Board of Trustees. I am also a member of the Board of Directors for Colorado Legal Services, a Commissioner on the Judicial Performance Commission for the 17th Judicial District, and a Member of the Colorado Supreme Court Disciplinary Hearings Advisory Panel. In prior years, I served on the church council for Our Lady of Visitation Catholic Church in Westminster, and as a Board Member of the Colorado Hispanic Bar Association, and as a Board Member of the Colorado Center on Law and Policy.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As an attorney, I represent many non-profit organizations whose missions I believe in and support.  These include Mile Hi Veterans (a Hispanic Veterans support organization, formerly known as the Mile Hi Chapter of the American GI Forum); RISE Colorado (an education advocacy group focused on empowering families); and the San Luis Vega (a non-profit dedicated to preserving the rights of the families living in Costilla County to use the Vega commons to graze their livestock).  In addition, for 15 years, I have served as pro-bono counsel in the Taylor Ranch class action litigation in which I represent the families in San Luis, Costilla County, who are fighting to restore the land-grant rights given to their ancestors when they settled the San Luis Valley in the early to mid 1800s. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the commission because I am committed to ensuring that re-districting is used to provide fair and equitable districts that respect natural communities of interest and protect minority voting rights.  I believe my commitment to a fair and equitable political system along with my training and experience as an attorney will make me a valuable member of the commission who will build consensus around fair outcomes.  
Because I believe in the importance of a fair political system, I am committed to using my time, experience and skills to help ensure that re-districting in Colorado leads to a fair and equitable outcome for all communities in Colorado.  Although I am a member of the Democratic Party and I have supported many Democratic political candidates, I will put my commitment to ensuring a fair and equitable political process above party politics.  I believe that re-districting processes should be non-partisan if possible, and it should focus on natural communities of interest and ensuring minority voters are not improperly disadvantaged. I also consider myself a moderate and am a strong believer in competitive districts.   I do not support using re-districting to provide unfair advantages to either political party.  

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As an attorney, I pride myself on my efforts and abilities to find consensus on challenging issues.  I am also a pragmatist who believes that an efficient, transparent, and fair process is the best way to reach a consensus among competing parties.  I also want to highlight the importance of listening when trying to understand and build consensus among competing parties.
As an example of consensus building and empathy, I would point to my service on the Board of Trustees of Colorado College as well as on the Judicial Performance Commission for the 17th Judicial District.  During nearly every meeting of these two important boards, as a group we must seek consensus on issues of high importance that are sometimes fiercely contested. During those heated debates, I use both empathy and respect for every board member and listen thoughtfully to build consensus when possible, and then move forward as a functioning group of opinionated and committed leaders.       

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
By nature, I am very logical and analytical.  As an undergraduate, I studied economics with an emphasis on public policy and quantitative analysis.  I thrived in my studies of economics because of its blend of analytics and logic.  In graduate school I earned a master’s degree in Public Policy.  This graduate degree required extensive analytical work, including statistical modeling and econometrics.  That quantitative work was combined with logic and reasoning in order to study and design effective public policies.  Finally, in law school, I was challenged to develop all of my analytical, reasoning, and logical skills so that I could become an effective advocate for a diverse group of clients in a variety of legal areas.  I have used and further refined all of these skills over the course of practicing law for 16 years.
