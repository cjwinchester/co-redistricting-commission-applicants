<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I have been involved at increasingly senior levels in organizational leadership, advocacy and community conversations for my entire career.
As a citizen of Louisville, I first was involved in designing and implementing a municipal arboretum as a member of what was then known as the Tree Board.  I next worked on the Board of Adjustments to listen to Citizen’s application for variances from our zoning codes to accommodate their specific property issues and aspirations.  As a two-term member City Council, I had the opportunity to work with a wide spectrum of the community on a variety of issues spanning power lines, residential and commercial development, school location, power line relocation, extra-municipality communications and many more.
As I look back, my favorite subjects where looking at long-term, region wide collaboration and planning opportunities.  As a member of the Boulder County Consortium of Cities, I spearheaded an effort to explore sharing of sales taxes to reduce redundant commercial development and to share library and recreation facilities.  As a member of the DRCOG Board, I worked with a wide-variety of stakeholders from other local governmental bodies to prioritize local and regional transportation issues and to manage the MetroVision Plan’s urban growth boundary.  This required balancing the needs and priorities our Louisville citizens with the more aggressive development interests of other communities in the metro Denver area.
I also have served on multiple non-profit boards and commissions.  My latest work with the Imagine! Foundation and the Imagine! governing board has taught me about the world of individuals with intellectual and development disabilities and allowed me to take that message to our community so that we can continue to implement a world of opportunities for all abilities.  
Even as  private citizen and as a Mayoral candidate last year, I became reacquainted with the local political scene – rekindling old friendships and meeting new citizens.  I got involved with a dispute between a group of neighbors and a individual who was redeveloping an older Louisville home and was able to help them reach a consensus on how to move forward.  I also worked with the team that was seeking to develop the old StorageTech property along US36 to help them express their message to the community so that we could find a way to ensure that Medtronic reinvested in our great community.
I have been involved in our civic, non-profit, and business community my entire adult life.  I have a wide network of individuals in a range of areas around our state and am confident I could listen to the various opinions that will be directed at the commission and work with my fellow commissioner to focus on a set of over-arching principals that I would expect we could agree on before we sit down with maps and numbers.

</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I served as a Councilman in the City of Louisville from January 2000 through December of 2007.  Prior to that, I served on several city advisory boards including the Tree Board and the Board of Adjustments. I ran for Mayor of Louisville unsuccessfully in 2019.  I served on the DRCOG Board of Directors from 2003 through 2007 and the Boulder County Consortium of Cities from 2005-2007.
I have donated money to many democratic candidates over the past 5 years including, but not necessarily limited to, Phil Weiser, Jena Griswold, John HIckenlooper, Sonja Jaquez-Lewis, Diane Mitch-Busch and Michael Bennet.
I have been involved with the Boulder County Democratic Party sporadically over the past 30 years helping run the County Assembly on at least two occasions.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have been involved in our civic, non-profit, and business community my entire adult life.  In all of these roles, I have been in a position to listen first and try to build consensus among the stakeholders in the conversation.  That is my skill.
This skill has helped me build a business from scratch to the point where it was recently acquired by a publicly traded company.  I built a customer base, worked with partners, managed employees and collaborated with vendor partners to achieve a success result for whatever specific situation we were working on.
I have a wide network of individuals in a range of areas around our state and am confident I could listen to the various opinions that will be directed at the commission and work with my fellow commissioner to focus on a set of over-arching principals that I would expect we could agree on before we sit down with maps and numbers.
I am eager to apply my talents and energy to help Colorado inaugurate this innovate redistricting process.  I will focus on collaboration and consensus so that we can provide a result to the Citizens of Colorado that meets their aspirations for this new process and provides as level a playing field as possible on which we can conduct our political discussions over the next 10 years.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My strategy would be to first spend time with my fellow commissioner to:
•	ensure that we all understand the laws, rules, and procedures that we must adhere to;
•	understand the perspective, goals and aspirations of my fellow commissioners; and;
•	Agree on a set of aspirational goals that we share as commissioners that we can refer back to when we find ourselves attempting to resolve the eventual differences of opinion that will arise.
In these times where we see and experience many examples of uncivil actions in our public and private arenas, it is critical that we focus first on what we can agree on so that we have touchstones that we can revisit when we have subsequent disagreements.  
These boards must aspire to be examples of civility, creativity and action so that we can deliver a result to the people of Colorado that enables our citizens to engage meaningfully on the issues, policies and candidates that we will encounter over the next 10 years.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I received a degree in Economics and History from Northwestern University.  As part of that degree, I took many classes that required the synthesis of multiple concepts and sources.  Whether learning the more analytical but theoretical concepts of micro and macro economics, to the intricacies of money and banking to the abstract historical concepts that can be gleaned from Economic History. 
After Northwestern, I worked in the restaurant industry for two years learning customer service and management of a business.
Finally, in Law School, we learned to study the facts and the law and apply these concepts to achieve outcomes that achieved some sort of justice for our clients.
In my business career, I have developed skills of managing budgets, building and managing to proforma projections, managing cashflows all while attempting to ensure that we were developing our software efficiently and getting our message out to potential customers in a compelling fashion.
I am not an engineer.  However, I understand Colorado geography.  I am familiar with the range of constituencies throughout our State.  I also understand the requirements that we draw maps that encompass the required populations numbers in a manner that encourages competitive races so that all citizens are represented.  
I have worked my entire adult life to resolve legal, municipal, neighborhood, and organizational challenges by spending time to learn the facts, understanding the underlying framework within which we  are working, gaining stakeholder input and, most importantly fostering a consensus building environment where, whenever possible, the stakeholders themselves are able to achieve a mutually agreement resolution.  I look forward to applying that same philosophy to the redistricting commission.
