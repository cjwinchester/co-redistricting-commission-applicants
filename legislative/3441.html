<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My experience has been through the organizations listed elsewhere in this application.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Redistricting has become a partisan political process in most states, with the party controlling the legislature drawing maps which favor their party.  Many of these maps are then litigated in courts.  My hope is that the new commissions will draw truly fair, nonpartisan districts which represent the communities of Colorado and that as many districts as possible will be truly competitive.  Control of the governments shifts between the parties, and the districts should be fair to both sides.  I have not served on a governmental citizens committee, and I would like to join others in taking my turn to serve.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Being president of the homeowners association gave me experience in working with a community,  dealing with conflicts, and developing policies and solutions on which most of the community could agree.  I learned that you can’t please all of the people any of the time.  If it could be done in compliance with Colorado’s open meeting laws, I would like to host a dinner for the commission members in my home so that we could get to know each other on a personal level.  It’s easier to work together and find common ground that way.  Both on boards and off, I think I can be fair and impartial because I recognize others have valid views and I try to understand them.  In my business, I have spent years making deals that have to work for all of the parties.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have forty years of business experience.  Every day I analyze business opportunities, which requires analyzing the numbers, and negotiating deals that are fair and equitable to all of the parties.  In many cases, I have been able to complete transactions that were rejected at first by explaining my reasoning and the numbers behind my proposals.  I think redistricting would involve similar skills.
