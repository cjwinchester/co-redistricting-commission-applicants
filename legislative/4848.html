<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Since my time in the military, I have developed a strong sense of civic duty. As a veteran, business owner, mom, teacher, and community member, I believe I bring a diverse perspective and valuable voice to this commission. I want to ensure that a fair process is established and maintained that includes a fair representation of our community. I have lived in CO for over 12 years, after leaving the military. I started my family and my business here. I believe in community engagement to ensure that inclusion, fairness, and democracy are being preserved. I would like to support this by serving on this commission and thus serving my state and community.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
While I&#39;ve given my time to my community from a more &#39;behind the scenes&#39; perspective, I have developed some great relationships across cities and counties. I have served with diverse groups of individuals across many boards and organizations. I can provide compassionate listening while drawing attention to structure, policy, and fairness. The leadership positions I&#39;ve held have educated me on how to deal with difficult people while bringing understanding and consensus to the table. These skills have proven helpful whether while taking action on a board, moderating conflict within companies or while facilitating strategic planning meetings where individuals don&#39;t agree on various issues. Regardless of the situation, I insist on mutual respect by keeping people focus on the problem, not the person. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a doctor and a workplace psychologist, I believe in Maslow before Bloom. One has to ensure that people are being taken care of before beginning to analyze and evaluate information. That being said, while I consider how people feel, I tend to make decisions not based on emotions, rather based on logical reasoning. I believe that one has to not only analyze and evaluate but also think critically and systematically. Systems thinking creates a space to consider creative ways to accomplish goals and objectives, not just by looking at the parts or the whole but how they are connected. I try to use this approach in everything I set out to achieve. If you&#39;re looking for skillsets, I am accomplished at project management, strategic planning, data analysis and interpretation, problem-solving, and attention to detail.
