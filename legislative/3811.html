        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Elizabeth Leland Parmelee</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Elizabeth Leland Parmelee
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Associate Vice President for Undergraduate Studies at Metropolitan State University of Denver
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  PhD and MA in International Studies from the Korbel School at University of Denver
BA in Comparative Language and Literature from Swarthmore College

</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80120
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I donated a small amount to Andrew Romanoff&#39;s campaign for 6th District in 2014.
I have made donations to the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition, J-Street, Planned Parenthood, and a variety of charities.
I have been highly involved in (non-partisan) MSU Denver&#39;s Get Out the Vote efforts and efforts to increase response to the 2020 Census.

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am an appointed member of the National Steering Committee of the American Democracy Project (American Association of State Colleges and Universities), as well as as associate member of the American Association of Colleges and Universities and the Coalition of Urban and Metropolitan Universities. Through MSU Denver I am a member of the Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce and have participated in Leadership Foundation programming such as Impact Denver.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Most of my civic work has been in my professional role at MSU Denver, overseeing civic and community engagement efforts in collaboration with other areas of the University. In that role, I attend community meetings with Eastside Unified (80205 neighborhood) and the La Alma/Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association, work with students and faculty on community partnerships, promote voter engagement, and collaborated on MSU Denver&#39;s recent state grant to support the 2020 Census count. Through my work with students, faculty, and community partners I have honed my listening skills and my ability to understand and reflect the needs and interests of diverse (and sometimes opposing) groups.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My interest is two-fold. First, I am deeply interested in helping with this new process, learning from the collaborative effort, and ensuring a fair and balanced districting map. My academic background in political science and developing democracies makes this endeavor particularly interesting to me, more so because my research on social capital and the development of trust among groups (such as the commissions) would seem particularly relevant to this work. Second, and perhaps more important to those selecting the commission, I feel that I bring a skill set that would be valuable, both with regards to analysis and problem solving, and with regards to my ability to work collaboratively, listen carefully to others&#39; expressed interests and needs, and balance what I am hearing with facts and figures. I love the challenge of a complex problem, particularly when I am able to engage with others in solving it.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I hold consensus as a core value and strive to bring others together when problem solving, seeking creative approaches to ensure that interests of diverse groups are heard and understood. My past research and work on developing social capital informs this - perhaps best described by the concept that when you bring people together, asking good questions, with good information, and the will to solve a problem, good things happen.
In my role as a leader at MSU Denver, my colleagues find me to be fair, willing to listen carefully, and avoid jumping to conclusions or arriving at a decision before hearing all possible angles and considering alternatives. I often work with colleagues who hold a different perspective, yet we are able to resolve issues and arrive at satisfactory solutions by balancing needs and values. For example, faculty and administrators are not always in agreement on policies and yet by recognizing the concerns of both groups we are often able to reach a solution. Regarding impartiality and fairness, I am an unaffiliated voter precisely because I feel that two opposing sides need to be balanced by those who can hear and consider opposing viewpoints, reflect those back for others to hear, and seek ways for the two sides to find consensus. Being able to pose questions that highlight common ground is part of this work, as is ensuring that all parties perceive that they have been heard and valued.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have written three different theses/dissertations and numerous papers and articles. While each of these took a different topic and approach, in each case I gathered information and data, considered different manners of understanding what I was observing, looking for patterns or anomalies. Most of my research has entailed interviewing members of a community in order to learn about their perspectives, experiences, and values. In order to move from the vast amount of information gathered in interviews to an ordered set of information that can support a conclusion, I must sort through themes, looking for connections and applying logic, using knowledge of similar cases. Another set of skills comes from my professional experience at MSU Denver, where I have long worked to support students who have encountered various obstacles to completing a degree. Identifying the obstacles and possible paths to a solution requires analysis of degree requirements, the student&#39;s strengths and interests, and then collaborating with faculty to ensure that the student is successful. While this is a very specific type of problem solving, the skills I bring to it may be highly relevant to the work of the commission. Essentially, I am looking at numbers (credit hours) that can be applied in different ways (to distinct degree requirements), yielding different outcomes depending on how they are combined. The ultimate goal is to use credit hours efficiently while still meeting the student&#39;s goals and adding value for them. 
Another example of problem solving, specifically in the context of a team effort is from when I participated in 2013 in the Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce Leadership Foundation&#39;s Impact Denver program. We were assigned to teams with people we didn&#39;t know and given a project to support the work of a local nonprofit. We relied on the varied skills and knowledge of the team to complete the project despite not having worked as a team before and having little knowledge of the subject matter. I see this example, and the learning I gained from it, as very similar to the challenge that will be presented to the Commission: resolve the puzzle of redistricting with a team of people who have not worked together before and with little direct expertise, relying on our abilities to collaborate, listen, analyze the information given to us, and balance the various needs and interests that exist in a fair manner. All of this in a relatively short time frame.
