        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Peter John Goergen Jr.</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Peter John Goergen Jr.
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Director of Acquisitions, East West Partners - Real Estate Development
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I’m fortunate to have an MBA from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, as well as a BA in English from the University of Virginia. I’m active in the Urban Land Institute on national and Colorado councils, and I’ve attended various leadership training courses over the years.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80206
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In the past presidential elections, I voted for Obama in 2008, Romney in 2012, Jill Stein in 2016, and Biden in 2020. Before the 2008 election, I went door-to-door for Obama, and I helped with Tom Perriello’s (Democrat) congressional campaign in Virginia for the 2010 election. I have not donated to or actively supported a political campaign since November 10, 2015.

One Snowmass Association – Past Board Member – 2017 to 2020

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Since I moved to Colorado, I’ve spent most of my time working, so I have very little experience organizing in Colorado. There are unfortunately few opportunities to advocate for neutral ground between Republicans and Democrats, and this is an opportunity to get involved in a redistricting process that can do just that. I have served on the board and as the President-Elect of the Snowmass Village Rotary, and while we did terrific work in our community and for non-profits in the Roaring Fork Valley, I wouldn’t call that advocacy work. I have also served on state and national councils within the Urban Land Institute, which seeks to promote equitable, healthy, and sustainable real estate in our communities. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Colorado’s redistricting should create congressional-district boundaries that make sense based on geography, neighborhoods, and communities, rather than political affiliation. The opportunity to help lead the charge of the de-politicization of Colorado’s district boundaries on the redistricting commission is an amazing chance to exercise my civic duty, helping Colorado serve as a model for other states to enact similar commissions. It’s important, and I’d love to be a part of it.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I’m an independent in heart and practice, I am open to views from both the left, right, and center, and I’m skilled at building consensus among disparate groups. I can write, I can communicate, and I can listen. I want all people to have their voice heard, and this commission is a perfect opportunity to help ensure that right. Gerrymandering, whether enacted for the benefit of Republicans or Democrats, is a shame, and the commission could use people like me committed to fair and impartial redistricting and building consensus among fellow commissioners to get us there.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I’ve been blessed with a good brain. Both my education in the MBA program at Wharton and work experience in real estate have placed a premium on using analytical skills, logic, and reason to solve problems. As a former CFO and current Director of Acquisitions for a prominent real estate firm in Denver, I utilize those three tools on a daily basis, but I also understand that all the logic in the world can’t help if you don’t listen and first understand the problem at hand.
