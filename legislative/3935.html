<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
This year was the second time in my life that I have donated to a political campaign. In 2016, I donated to the democratic candidate for Colorado&#39;s 4th Congressional district. This year I donated to the Hickenlooper campaign and the Biden campaign.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I served on the Douglas County School District&#39;s (DCSD) District Accountability Committee for three years, first as a member, then vice chair, and finally as chair of the committee. I also served on two task force committees for DCSD: the Joint Task Force to review Bond and MIL recommendations, and the Special Education Task Force, which reviewed existing special education programming and needs for students with disabilities. I am a member of the William E. Doyle Inn of Court, a professional organization designed to mentor and develop new attorneys. I am also a member of the Colorado Women&#39;s Bar Association where I serve on the Policy Committee, and a member of the Faculty of Federal Advocates. I am a member of the American Civil Liberties Union and part of Mental Health Colorado’s Brain Trust.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a member of the DCSD District Accountability Committee leadership, I represented the concerns of parents with children with disabilities and children receiving free or reduced lunches. In that role, I evaluated policies and made recommendations to the elected Board of Education that would benefit all students while protecting the rights and needs of less privileged students. I also worked to develop consensus within a contentious community and helped create broad support for a school Bond Measure and MIL Levy Override that passed in 2018. As a law student, I helped build a coalition of students, professors, and administrators to build a system of support for students of color. That effort begun in 2017 dovetailed with the work of other student initiatives, and resulted in increased funding and support for students of color at the law school. Also, as a military spouse of 24 years, I served on countless committees, organizations, and private groups designed to build and support military families during our nation’s longest war. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the commission to develop an equitable district map for all Coloradans. Democracy flourishes when all voices are represented fairly. I believe district maps should reflect both community affinities and diverse viewpoints so that the marketplace of ideas does not become an echo chamber. I believe consensus leads to better government than partisan division. And I believe Colorado&#39;s diverse values and voices should be honored in a district map that reflects the differing and sometimes conflicting needs and concerns of our citizens. Such a map promotes robust debate and discussion, encourages creative problem solving, and prioritizes citizen engagement in decision-making.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am a proven community leader, consensus-builder, and champion of the reasonable compromise. I bring a skill set that will help Colorado develop a district map that promotes diversity of viewpoints while honoring community affinities. In Douglas County, I stood shoulder to shoulder with Republicans, Independents, and Democrats in a non-partisan effort to provide much-needed funding for our schools. As a leader for that initiative, I was instrumental in building bridges between the community factions, soothing resentment, and finding common ground. When disparate factions would not speak to each other, each of them would speak with me. As a result of my ability to collaborate with diverse groups, Douglas County approved a new tax measure for the first time in over a decade. 
As a recent law student, I interned for a prisoner&#39;s rights clinic working to de-incarcerate prisoners and later for a district attorney’s appellate office working to ensure prisoners’ convictions were upheld. Despite the fact that these organizations are on opposite sides of a charged issue, I found that both offices sought to further justice and compassion. My ability to recognize the value in each position and to rationally evaluate the consequences of each, both intentional and otherwise, makes me a fair and impartial judge of an issue. My ability to recognize the value in each person makes me a diplomatic spokesperson.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am a fellow in appellate law, and I spend my days analyzing legal arguments in order to advocate for a just outcome. Of the legal professions, appellate law is perhaps the most analytical, because it asks practitioners to both apply the law, and to envision how the law ought to be applied. Because I excelled in this skill set, I was selected for a prestigious appellate fellowship. (Please note that I am applying for this commission in my private capacity, and not in my capacity as a fellow.)
Prior to attending law school, I was an adjunct professor of humanities, where I taught courses in logic and argumentation, value ethics, critical thinking, and history. My firm grasp of academic and practical logic and argumentation helped me excel in teaching others critical problem solving, reasoned argumentation, and logical thinking. 
As a member of the non-partisan school board committee, I was called upon to think carefully about the impact of policies and policy change. Under my leadership, every recommendation our committee brought to the Board of Education was approved—something that was not the case for other committees that reported to the Board or for every policy our committee brought to the Board prior to my leadership. Our recommendations were trusted because the community recognized we carefully analyzed each policy, evaluated the consequences of change and stasis, and developed recommendations that benefited the district as a whole. 
These skills make me an exceptional candidate for the commission.
