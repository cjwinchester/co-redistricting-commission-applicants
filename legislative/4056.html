<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been heavily involved in Republican political organizations in Colorado since 2008.  I moved to Colorado full time in 1998.  My political activities include Chair of the Pitkin County Republicans, member of the Executive Committee of the Colorado Republican Committee, and Republican Chair of the Third Congressional District in Colorado.  I resigned from those positions in November 2015 due to a health incident.  My husband and I donate frequently to Republican candidates and organizations in Colorado and nationally.  I am happy to try to prepare a list for you, but it would be voluminous.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Please see the answer to the immediately prior question for political activities.  With respect to civic and community organizations, I am a member of the Rotary Club of Aspen and have served as Chair of the Ducky Derby Sponsorship Committee (the principal fundraising endeavor of the Club, which raises funds for scholarships for local students and helps support other local nonprofit organizations and international civic projects).  I have also served as President of the Snowmass/Capitol Creek Caucus in Pitkin County, which makes recommendations to the Pitkin County Commissioners on land use and water matters in our neighborhood, and I was recently a member of the Communiy Character Workgroup of the Aspen Airport Visioning Committee, a group appointed by the County Commissioners to make recommendations concerning the planned expansion of the local airport.  I have also been President and a member of several homeowners association boards in Colorado, including the homeowners association where we live.  I have served for many years as an Election Judge in Pitkin County.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
In each of the positions in which I&#39;ve served as noted above, I have played a central role in organizing, representing, advocating for and considering the interests of groups and organizations in Colorado.  Certainly my involvement in political activities has, of necessity, entailed all of these skills.  As Chair of the Ducky Derby Sponsorship Committee of the Rotary Club of Aspen I needed to organize a major fundraising effort which included reaching out to the Club membership as well as the local business community.  As President of the Snowmass/Capitol Creek Caucus, I helped establish our agenda and led the efforts to interface with the Pitkin County Commissioners on behalf of our neighborhood interests.  Although I did not have a leadership role in the airport-related group, I needed to be able to advocate for disparate interests such as growth versus no-growth, environmental quality and accommodation of next-generation aircraft.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have always believed that we all have a responsibility to be active in our communities.  The commission is yet another way I can be involved.  The work of the commission is critical to Colorado&#39;s future.  I&#39;m interested in seeing whether a less partisan approach to redistricting can be more successful than past efforts.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In each of the positions in which I&#39;ve served, I have had to help resolve disparate views on various matters.  Sometimes those views have been widely divergent.  It is extremely important to try to understand, through communication with others, their perspectives on a given subject.  Because I am willing to try to understand all points of view, including those different from mine, I believe I have the ability to be fair, impartial and fact-based in reaching a conclusion.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a practicing lawyer, I was trained to apply analysis, logic and reason to resolving a problem within the context of laws.  My history of experience in the legal profession and in business has helped me understand how to work within organizations with a diversity of views and to give weight to all perspectives and reach a conclusion that most in the group can accept.  I have also been part of endeavors not otherwise described in this application which called forth the attributes necessary to resolve problems within organizations, such as Executive Director and General Counsel of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, established by Congress to regulate the municipal bond industry.  I was also a member of the National Commission on Public Works Improvement, again established by Congress, to study the state of the nation&#39;s infrastructure and report to Congress on the same.
