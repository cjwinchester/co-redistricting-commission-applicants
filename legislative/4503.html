<p>
  Bruce Nassau
</p>

<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I have built a national Cable TV Satellite contracting business employing hundreds of diverse employees from all walks of life and from all over the United States. In addition, I have spent the last ten years building a Cannabis business serving on different boards and have maintained interest predominantly in Colorado but also in Oregon, Nevada, Illinois, and now in Missouri.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>

This educational background in Communication has included diverse training and educational experience in everything from public speaking, organizational communication, group dynamics, persuasion, and interpersonal communication. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80215
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am a registered unaffiliated voter in the state. I have donated to candidates who I believe will be problem solvers, regardless of their party affiliation. Additionally, I have given financial support to various State House and Senate Republican and Democratic fundraisers. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Prior Board Chair and continuing Board Member of the Marijuana Industry (MIG), state’s largest cannabis industry organization.
I worked with both Democrats and Republicans in the State House and Senate for cannabis legislation. 
I worked with Mayor Hancock and staff regarding cannabis rules and enforcement. 
I worked with the Department of Revenue’s Marijuana Enforcement Division regarding rules and regulations for the marijuana industry. 

Board Member-Colorado Leads-Cannabis Group
I worked with state Democrats and Republicans on cannabis legislation.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My Speech Communications Ph.D. focused on organizational behavior which I have used extensively throughout my business and personal life. Given my background as a Ph.D., I have built various business organizations, participated as a board chairman in the Marijuana Industry group, and helped transition Governor Polis as a subcommittee member. My background includes being a college educator teaching public speaking, organizational community persuasion, proof and evidence, and interpersonal communication. As a factor of my life experiences and professional background, I can work with all political viewpoints, and diverse racial and ethnic people.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I wish to give back to my community and state as I have been most fortunate to live, build a wonderful family, and to establish successful businesses in the state. As a result of being a successful businessman, I have dealt with state and local government officials on both sides of the aisle and I bring unique insights into the negotiation of redistricting lines.

My background includes working with people from both sides of the aisle and with those of different racial and sexual identities. I employ a diverse group of people from all over the country and of varying religious and political backgrounds. This has allowed me to work with and listen to people on both sides of the aisle and appreciate the importance of listening and processing how others think. As an independent voter I understand both sides of the aisle, which I will take into account as an agent for building and achieving consensus. 

Accordingly, I understand that the new redistricting map must account for the many differences in the state. Places like Colorado Springs and Denver are diverse in how they see the political world and this must be reflected in the new district maps. There must be fairness in determining the new districts, which requires listening to the input of all schools of political thought in the decision-making process. 

My educational, political, and business background has taught me methods in dealing with diverse opinions and thought processes in dealing with problem resolution in non-threatening ways. As an independent voter, I listen to both sides of the aisle and appreciate the need to be fair and equitable in establishing a thorough districting process. I can and will be impartial in voicing my thoughts to the committee as we draw the new district map. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My greatest strengths are in team building and problem solving through finding common ground among disagreeing participants. I have always gotten along with diverse people with differing beliefs and attitudes. One of my most effective techniques in gaining consensus is breaking groups into smaller units which encourages people to speak their minds. Once that’s achieved, and people see each other as people rather than as opponents, problems can be resolved once the small groups are brought back with their other participants in the larger group. 

An example of my consensus and team building is my Cable TV business. It comprises Accounting, HR, Marketing, Training, and Operations departments. Each department is composed of different types of people with differing perspectives on the business. My role was to develop each department into a cohesive unit that allowed the organization to grow into a national entity. This demonstrates my ability to build organizations in differing industries with diverse groups of people. 

In my role as board chair of the Marijuana Industry group, I dealt with small, medium, and large organizations with differing views and needs. I facilitated the members coming together to work with legislators and the Marijuana enforcement division in developing Cannabis legislation and rulemaking for the industry. 

I have always operated as a consensus builder. I have built various business that operate throughout the U.S. As such, I have worked with people of different religious and political backgrounds in order to be successful at business as well the boards I have served on. I pride myself as a negotiator and consensus builder which requires listening to diverse points of view. I am not a one-sided person; diversity lends to better decisions and outcomes!
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In graduate school, I studied statistics and have used this background throughout my professional career. My statistical knowledge has been an important part of my success as a multiple business operator due to its emphasis on logic and reasoning when it comes to problem solving. I can bring this same approach to the commission and analyze problems with logic and reason. In addition, as a natural leader, I am confident that through good listening and using logic in understanding other points of view, consensus can be achieved. Through logic, reasoning, and consensus building, I am confident that I can work through difficult problems with the other redistricting commissioners and create a new district map that represents Colorado fairly.
