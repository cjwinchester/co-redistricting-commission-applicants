<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I appreciate this opportunity to contribute to an equal and fair electoral process. My life experiences make me a highly qualified candidate for providing the commission with an impartial and fair assessment for drawing district boundaries. In terms of my background, I am 38 years old and am a native of Colorado. My parents brought my brother and myself up with values of honesty, integrity, and compassion for fellow humans and our planet. I have traveled and explored throughout our beautiful state and have had the wonderful experience of visiting Hawaii and Mexico. I have friends from many backgrounds and ethnicities and family with deep roots and close ties. I understand the importance of civil rights and justice in our society with voting equality being a crucial factor toward achieving positive changes. I attended college at CU Boulder where I studied philosophy and psychology, after which I transferred to the University of Northern Colorado where I graduated with my Bachelor of Arts in Political Science. I also studied Culinary Arts at the Art Institute of Colorado, earning my diploma. Other than formal education; I strive to learn every day. Cooking is a passion I enjoy sharing with others, whether that is hosting holiday dinners for my family, baking breads to share with friends and neighbors or teaching my partner a technique or recipe. The skills and knowledge of academia I learned have applied to my life in practical and beneficial ways. I have been employed at HCL Engineering and Surveying as a Construction Inspector since January 2015. While working at HCL Engineering, I perform inspections for storm and sewer drainage on new construction projects. I have also volunteered for Habitat for Humanity with my colleagues regularly, helping to build homes for those less fortunate. I believe that with my diverse background and understanding of the local community, I will be an asset to the commission. I have made my home in Arvada. I purchased a HUD foreclosure house in 2012 and have spent the last several years making it mine. Working as the project manager, I employed my analytical skills during a complete renovation. I collaborated and brainstormed with contractors, negotiated bids, I oversaw the quality of the work to be sure it met my budget and timelines. With these life skills and background, I will bring diversity, an open-mind approach to assisting the commission in redistricting Coloradoâ€™s political boundaries. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My background in Psychology gives me an understanding of people and where they&#39;re coming from. I like helping negotiate misunderstandings and disagreements because I truly believe we&#39;re at our best when we cooperate. I remember being told as a child that the world isn&#39;t fair and life isn&#39;t fair and my answer to that was always, that doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t try to make things better and more fair. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I care less about politics than I do about finding understanding and consensus. I feel like our political process has become paralyzed by people&#39;s strong feelings about particular issues and there isn&#39;t enough importance placed on logic and reason anymore. I&#39;m excited for this opportunity to take some of the politics and gerrymandering out of our state and hopefully provide an example to other states when some of these important voting mechanisms become less political.
