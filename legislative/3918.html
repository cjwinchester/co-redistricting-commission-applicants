<h3>Contact Information</h3>

Breakthru Beverage Colorado
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am an active and engaged voter. I have never missed an election in Colorado where I have been voting for 25 years. In the past ten years I have donated either time or nominal financial amounts to Planned Parenthood, NARAL, Obama, Clinton and Biden campaigns. I have also contributed to the SOS Denver campaign to save the Park Hill Golf Course from a dissolution of the protective environmental easement. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Overlook at Park Hill Neighborhood Association, Park Hill Elementary PTSA, Women of Denver. SOS Denver.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My first introduction to organizing and advocacy was during an internship with NARAL Pro Choice Colorado during college. Through this internship I gained insight to how bills are drafted, heard and ultimately voted upon in the State Legislature. I learned how to mobilize constituents and connect them with their representatives to make their voices heard. In recent years organizational volunteer work is centered around my neighborhood and my child&#39;s school. Though the size, scope and goals are quite different much of the process is the same. This includes gathering, listening and actual hearing input from neighbors, other parents and members of our community on the things that are the most important to them. Followed by complete and careful analysis and problem shooting. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have long wanted to contribute to the city, state and community in which I live in a more meaningful way. I believe with the new laws that we as citizens passed in 2018 regarding an overhaul of the redistricting process we have said we want regular people, members of the community, to have a role. While I understand that an overhaul of this system is an immense undertaking I believe it is necessary in order to create a system and ultimately a map that is fair and does not give the power to draw the map to the very people seeking power. The responsibility for reform falls on the voters who approved the Amendments Y and Z. I am one of those voters and believe I can be fair and impartial when making decisions.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
By my very nature I am a mediator. I believe the best qualities one can have to create consensus are patience, listening skills, compassion, rationality, empathy and optimism. It is important to understand when something isn&#39;t practical even though you&#39;d really like it to be. I believe it is useful to not be quick to anger. Compromise is difficult when emotions are running high. I do believe I possess a good balance of feeling with pragmatism.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Analyzing data is a large part of my job currently. Though the data I look at is different I believe I possess the analytical skills to look at, absorb and understand what that data represents. I have excellent critical thinking skills that immediately lend themselves to problem solving. Once a problem has been determined, the logical next step in my mind is to explore solutions. Above all I believe I am a logical person. Being able to see both sides of a conflict equally and at times help those involved see another point of view is something that has always come rather naturally to me. I do not think this process can happen successfully with out that type of compromise.
