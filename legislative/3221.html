        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Prudence Louise Hartt Pande</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Prudence Louise Hartt Pande
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Arun Pande</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  In July I retired from work as an auditor at Colorado Department of Labor.  I had worked for the State of Colorado since 1996 and Colorado Department of Labor since 2003.  I was promoted to an auditor position in 2008.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  In 1971 I received a bachelor&#39;s degree from Bradley University, where I majored in international studies and minored in journalism.  In 1972 I received a diploma from the Sorbonne in Paris, France, where I completed graduate level classes in French literature and civilization.  In 1977 I received a Master&#39;s of International Management from Thunderbird at the American Graduate School of International Management.  I have since acquired enough college credits for a major in accounting.  I have been certified for advanced tax preparation by H &amp; R Block, and I am currently enrolled in Spanish 112 at Community College of Aurora.  
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80247
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am a registered Republican but I am not involved in political activities, which could have posed a conflict of interest to my work as an auditor.  Recently I worked for four days as an election judge in Arapahoe County.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Denver World Affairs Council, Alliance Francaise, Eastern Hills Community Church, Tesoro Cultural Center
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As an auditor I had to make and defend decisions involving the best interests of opposing groups, including employers, workers, contractors, and the unemployed.  I wrote briefs and represented the Department of Labor at appeals and hearings.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am very concerned about fair representation for all residents of Colorado.  I am completely neutral on these issues, and I have no financial or political interests that would make me vulnerable to outside pressures.  I am recently retired and I have all the time in the world to devote to this task.  As a former reporter I really enjoy meeting and working with people who approach the same issue from different perspectives.  This is an era of distrust and division, and it is time for qualified citizens to step up.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Please see the last question.  I have 10 years of work experience as a reporter, and I seldom wrote editorials.  I have spent most of my working life investigating, interviewing people, and organizing findings to present a clear and accurate picture of a situation.  I have learned that first impressions are often inaccurate or incomplete.  I have learned to double check data and boldly ask follow-up questions before forming and expressing my own views.  Questions are more effective than opinions and statements.  When there is  genuine agreement about goals and strategies the road to consensus begins to emerge.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Auditors gather pieces of information to form a big picture.  They examine clues to generate a clear and accurate description of circumstances.  Findings and decisions are then frequently defended before a judge during appeals and hearings.  To be persuasive the findings must b e clear and reasonable.  My supervisor at Colorado Department of Labor will attest to my competence in this area.
