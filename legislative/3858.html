<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have sent numerous $5 - $50 campaign contributions via ActBlue to countless congressional, senate, presidential campaigns District Attorneys, etc. I do not have a comprehensive list dating to 2015. However, all of them were Democrats.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I volunteered for political canvassing in Indiana/Ohio Democratic primaries in 2015 and for Denver City Council District 10 canvassing in 2018. This was in an informal capacity and not an organization per se.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Through my work as a campaign canvasser and legislative aide, I have significant experience in expanding outreach to individuals and demographic groups with limited exposure to local government. I am very comfortable speaking one-on-one with individuals at their doorstep and organizing information sessions with extensive flyering and other means of notification. In one example, as an aide overseeing the council office’s outreach on an area plan, not only did I conduct traditional methods of outreach such as attending neighborhood organization meetings, I also trained a network of younger volunteers and provided them with the necessary resources to host their own public feedback sessions in neighborhoods with high numbers of students and young renters. In addition, I collaborated with large property managers to distribute information about numerous information sessions I held in coffee shops and bars seeking community feedback. These combined efforts resulted in the greater participation of lower income renters and large, multi-unit building occupants in the feedback process for a neighborhood planning initiative in which wealthier, older, single-family unit home owners were over-represented in proportion to their neighborhood population.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The dynamism of our state is due to the everchanging complexity and evolution of its cities and regions. Such complexity is inevitably the result of at times conflicting and at times overlapping interests of various communities within a given locale. I want to be a part of helping to negotiate those interests and tensions in the hope of seeing Colorado evolve smoothly and sustainably as the population grows. As an Art Historian with a training in historical geography and cartography, I am acutely aware of how identity and ideology are mapped onto space, and I want to be part of those mapping efforts.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The most important attribute I bring to promoting consensus is my capacity for abstraction and long-term thinking. What may initially appear to be a point of contention in the immediate moment may, when viewed through the perspective of long-terms goals, turn out to have a straightforward resolution. Certainly, everyone will not agree 100% of the time, but if we can get to a set of agreed upon long-term expectations, that should help with focusing up the dialogue about necessary immediate and short-term recommendations. 

As to my ability to be impartial, as someone who has taught numerous college courses involving contentious and politically fraught material, my students had a broad range of backgrounds and experiences they bought to bare on the subject matter. I’ve read interpretations of a subject that varied widely from student to student. I always evaluated each of those interpretations on its own merits and argumentation rather than on my personal opinion.
