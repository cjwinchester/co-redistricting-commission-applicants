<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I was heavily involved in Republican Party politics for about 25 years, starting in the 1980s.    I became involved as a precinct committeeman, and attended numerous county, congressional and state assemblies over a 25 year period.   That involvement gave rise to a number of political activities, some of which are summarized below: 

1.  I was a special counsel to the Arapahoe County Commissioners in connection with the 1990 reapportionment, and argued before the Colorado Supreme Court in the 1992 case of In Re Apportionment of General Assembly, 92SA19, 828 P.2d 185 (Colo. 1992).  (Case is attached.)

2.  I was elected to serve on the Greenwood Village City Council from 1988 to 1992, during which time I served as Mayor Pro Tem.  I was, at the time, actively involved in Republican politics.  Nonetheless, I attended Democratic group meetings at least 4 or 5 times a year, to hear what was of import to them.  I feel that this &quot;bridging&quot; in public service is all but lost in much of our communal life today.
 
I am going to digress with an anecdote about my mother--a lifelong Roosevelt Democrat.  This is a story I often told when I met with Democratic groups in my role as an elected official:  

Mom was heavily involved in the Democratic Party in Arapahoe County in the 1960s (such as it was).  A child of the Depression, she grew up extremely poor on a Montana homestead.  This made mom a ceaseless and natural advocate for the underdog.  I had a strong libertarian leaning in my late teens, and chose to register as a Republican in 1973.  The Vietnam War was still ongoing, and the Agnew resignation and Watergate were on the near horizon.  It wasn&#39;t a rebellion.  It was more of an expression of my nascent libertarian leaning beliefs.  When I came home from the Clerk and Recorder, Mom asked if I had listed a party affiliation.  I admitted I had.  Republican.  My wonderful mother, who loved me very much, just sighed.  And then she said (with a bit of a wry smile), &quot;Well, even Christ lost one...&quot;

Our family was politically split, but we had years of respectful discussion of how to bridge the divide.  That, sadly, is a skillset that seems to be in decline today.

3.  I served on the Board of the Denver Regional Council of Governments in the late 1980s to early 1990s.

4.  I have served on the Cherry Creek Water Quality Authority, during my service on the Greenwood Village City Council.

I chose not to continue to seek elected office in the mid-1990s, and have since been involved through supporting numerous campaigns and organizations.  For the last 20 years I have attempted to support good public policy by donating regularly to local, state and national campaigns and committees, across the political spectrum.  The following is a listing of those campaigns and organizations which have received contributions from me since November 10, 2015:

In 1990 I saw first-hand the charged partisan atmosphere in reapportionment.  I supported the passage of Amendments Y and Z, and would be honored to serve.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have been honored to spend most of my adult life heavily involved in charitable and community activities.  My activities over the last 10 years have been most heavily involved in the promotion of sound water policy in Colorado, and in addressing the needs of children--both in Colorado and elsewhere.  I have participated in the following community service activities since November 10, 2015:

1.  I have a home in Frisco, Colorado. For the last 15+ years I have served on the Board of Directors of the Mountainside Homeowner&#39;s Association.  In that role, I was the primary driver behind the restoration of the historic Bill&#39;s Ranch Lake in Frisco, Colorado, and I raised over $250,000 towards the renovation and maintenance of Bill&#39;s Ranch Lake.

2.  I have served as a Board Member and President of the following metropolitan districts and water and sanitation districts and governmental authorities:

     Adams East Metropolitan District
     Alta Mire Metropolitan Districts Nos. 1-5
     Bromley Park Metropolitan District Nos. 3, 5 and 6
     Cottonwood Greens Metropolitan District No. 5
     Douglas County Water Authority
     Elkhorn Ranch Metropolitan District No. 1
     Highlands Metropolitan District Nos. 1-5
     Platte River Metropolitan District
     Platte River Water Development Authority
     Silver Peaks Metropolitan Districts 1-5
     South Beebe Draw Metropolitan District
     United Water and Sanitation District
     Weld Adams Water Development Authority

3.  I established and served on the committee for the passage of the Claire Davis School Safety Act, passed by the Legislature in 2015.  The 2 bills passed were sponsored by the then Democratic Speaker of the House Hullinghorst and House Majority Leader Duran, and by the then Republican President of the Senate Cadman and the Senate Majority Leader Scheffel. 

4.  I was the founder of and have served as a Board Member of Legacy Water, an organization dedicated to protecting the historic rights of Colorado water rights holders.

5.  I am a significant sponsor of the CASA program for children in foster care in Adams and Broomfield counties.  As a result of my significant donations over the last 15 years, CASA honored me with Philanthropist of the Year.

6.  For the last 12 years I have sponsored the Lembke Scholarships to support the leadership building activities of the Elbert County 4H program.

7.  Upon learning that the community of Kersey, Colorado, had failed to obtain GOCO funding for a playground that had been decommissioned as unsafe, I funded the construction of a new children&#39;s playground to serve the Kersey community.

8.  I established the Lembke Family Fund at the Denver Foundation. from which over $3,000,000 in contributions for community needs have been made in recent years, with an emphasis on the unmet needs of children.

9.  Although I am a gentile, I have been heavily involved in supporting the bi-annual trip conducted by Jewish Colorado for the benefit of Colorado legislators.  I have been the lead sponsor of the legislative trip in 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019.  This trip has allowed leaders from both parties to develop a shared trust and understanding outside of the legislative arena, and has contributed to the passage of key bi-partisan legislation over the last 10 years.

10.  As a result of my trips to Israel, I have developed a respect and affection for the population--Jewish, Muslim and Christian, and have been involved in funding the following projects:
      
     10.1  The church at Magdala, Israel, Duc in Altum, located in the historic home of Mary Magdalene.  This Catholic project was spear-headed by Father Juan Solana, who has become a close friend as a result of this project.

     10.2  I was the sole funding source for a disabled children&#39;s educational program in the remote area of the Negev desert area in southern Israel.

     10.3  With Dr. Mort Mower of Denver, we jointly funded (50% each) the construction of  a water reservoir and associated infrastructure to serve the agricultural areas of the Arava desert area in southern Israel.

     10.4  I am a member of the World Chairman&#39;s Council of the Jewish National Fund, which represents the largest donors to charitable projects in Israel.     
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have been honored to serve our Colorado community in a leadership role most of my life.  My leadership roles started early, and I believe they continue to this day.  In a somewhat chronological order, here are some of the leadership roles I have assumed in organizing, advocating for, and considering the interests of groups in Colorado.

1.  At age 13, I was dissatisfied with the programming offered by my local Boy Scout troop.  To remedy the situation, I convinced my father and several other dads to sponsor a new troop in the area, focused on extensive camping and hiking, with an emphasis on at least one 50 mile hike per year.  This troop grew from 6 members to over 75 members in 18 months.  I was the founding Senior Patrol Leader for the first 3 years of the troop&#39;s existence.  This was my first attempt at large group leadership.  Our troop made a concerted effort to reach out beyond our smaller community, to seek out boys that might not have otherwise had the opportunity to participate in such activities.

2.  When I was in high school, I advocated heavily for the establishment of dedicated bicycle lanes in my home town of Littleton, Colorado.  In 1971 (when I was 16) I was able to assemble a disparate group of over 200 to support this proposal.  As a result, Littleton was one of the first communities in the State to repaint traffic control to establish bicycle lanes.  Those lanes still exist.  

3.  As a member of the Greenwood Village City Council, in 1990 I co-wrote and co-sponsored one of the nation&#39;s first ordinances requiring environmental handling and recycling of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).  CFCs are associated with rapid deterioration of the ozone layer of our atmosphere.  My co-sponsor and I sought to have the Denver City Council adopt a similar ordinance, which was accomplished less than 3 months later.  In 1994, the US government established similar nationwide limitations on CFCs.

4.  I was a founding member of the Executive Board of Health One, and was chairman of the development and asset committee.  When HCA Healthcare sought to purchase several of our hospitals during the late 80s&#39; economic downturn in Colorado, I worked heavily with participants in the health care community.  As a result of the efforts of those of us who wanted to maintain a community voice in health care, we were able to force the formation of what was known as HealthOne, a 50-50 joint venture with HCA.  HealthOne was the largest public-private health care joint venture in the United States.  As a result of our group actions, community involvement in hospital decisions was extended another 20 years, until 2011.  In 2011, HCA finally purchased the hospitals in question for a total of over $1.45 billion.  These funds served as the driver to make the Colorado Health Foundation (the holder of the &quot;public&quot; part of the joint venture) the largest foundation in Colorado, with assets of over $2.6 billion in assets.  I am deeply proud that I was a key participant in preventing the sale of local hospitals at depressed prices during a local economic depression.  Although I stepped off of the board some years prior to the 2011 sale, the results of our activities in the early 1990s continues to benefit the Colorado community.

5.  In the early 2000s, I recognized that further quality growth in Colorado would be dependent on developing additional water sources and reservoir storage for small Colorado communities.  I also was attuned to the decline in the non-tributary aquifers that served much of Arapahoe and Douglas counties.  To address both needs,  I formed United Water and Sanitation District in 2002, with the goal of integrating water infrastructure and providing alternatives to non-tributary water.  

Over the last 17 years, United has worked to integrate infrastructure systems to serve communities in Douglas, Arapahoe, Adam and Weld counties, working with and advocating for sound water policy.   The United Water team has developed relationships throughout the area, and has been involved in coalescing consensus on some difficult water policy issues facing the state.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I watched the highly charged process of reapportionment after the 1990 census. I observed the hyper-partisanship of those proceedings, and realized that &quot;normal folks&quot; had no idea what was really going on behind the scenes.  I thought there had to be a better way.

In the last 10 years, we&#39;ve seen an increasing tribalism in our national politics.   Leaders seeking consensus can be vilified by the more partisan members of their caucus.   Many of our existing districts were drawn to favor the party then in power.    The creation of &quot;safe&quot; districts--concentrating the members of one party or viewpoint--can encourage brittle partisanship.  In a &quot;safe&quot; district, the voices of the &quot;others&quot; isn&#39;t heard.  It may not even exist.

I would hope by serving on the commission I can assist in developing legislative districts that are more balanced, and which can assist in better ensuring the reasoned and rational discourse on which our institutions rely.

I would be proud to say I was  able to play a small part in improving the institutions on which we all rely.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have spent a lifetime building consensus in areas often rife with conflict.  When I first ran for office in 1988, I had the odd distinction of being endorsed by the Sierra Club and the Board of Realtors.  Odd bedfellows indeed.  But bridging worlds of conflict is what I enjoy doing.  

I believe I have a demonstrated ability to seek and obtain consensus.  From the sponsorship of the Claire Davis School Safety Act in 2015, to working with both Jewish, Arab and Christian populations in Israel, I enjoy trying to see the other side.  When an issue is important, I can take a stand in a way that does not alienate.  When a concession is needed to move a program forward, I have the demonstrated ability to make it.  
As you can see from my political resume, I seek involvement with both sides of the aisle.  I believe that leadership in both parties know me personally as fair and knowledgeable.  I believe that my life-long residence in the State, with business and governmental interests in many areas of Colorado, allow me the foundation to be fair and impartial, recognizing the needs of disparate communities.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Holding certification as both a CPA and an attorney, I believe I has a demonstrated ability to recognize the broad patterns of an issue (the lawyer side of me), while simultaneously demanding data to support positions (my accountant side).

My professional and civic lives have been involved in assimilating data, viewing it from what I hope is a fresh perspective, then applying logic to arrive a an efficient and novel resolution.  I believe I have a reputation as a thorough thinker on issues, with an ability to coalesce solutions to what has often been seen as intractable issues.
