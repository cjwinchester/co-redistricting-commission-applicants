  Software Engineer, United Launch Alliance
</p>

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
In Colorado, I&#39;ve organized, represented, and advocated for the Secular Hub--a nonprofit community center for atheists, agnostics, humanists and their families. Bringing experience from volunteer leadership positions in Texas and Arizona, I co-founded the Secular Hub&#39;s Community Service Committee, organizing a team of community members to create volunteer and fundraising opportunities and to provide support for members of our community. As the Board Chair and as a POC for outreach events, I represented the organization at public events hosted at our facility and at local festivals like the People&#39;s Fair and PrideFest. As a participant in a lobby day at the U.S. Capitol, I shared my community&#39;s concerns about pending legislation with the staff for Senator Gardner and Representative DeGette.

I’ve also encouraged increased civic participation in our community by hosting debate viewing parties, a ballot measure Q&amp;A (with an advocate and an opponent), and a Civics lesson with former State Senator Lois Court. More recently, I invited Dr. Beth Malmskog, an assistant professor of mathematics from Colorado College, to speak on how to use mathematics to assess the fairness of proposed district maps.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I vote and have made donations to causes friends are passionate about. I also attend both my Republican and Democratic house district meetings. 

Donations:  2018, $50-100, Swing Left; 7/3/2019, $100, Dr. Radhika Nath For Denver Kids
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Secular Hub (a community for atheists, agnostics, humanists, and other nonbelievers):  Member, 2013-present; Founder, Community Service Committee, 2014; Board Member, 2016-2018; Board Chair, 2016-2017
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
When rank partisanship finds its way into processes that are fundamental to our democracy (as it has in other states), it undermines confidence in our institutions and in our system. The unfairness of it can cause apathy and antipathy that lead to civic disengagement and civil unrest. For all their promise, Amendments Y and Z are not the end-all of redistricting reform, but they give Coloradans a shot at a fairer, more transparent process that can help reinforce the legitimacy of our system.

With so many factors at play, “fairness” (in terms of the final map) will be difficult to define and more difficult to achieve. But in Amendments Y and Z, the citizens of Colorado have provided a set of criteria that the commission must work to faithfully balance as they evaluate and provide feedback on proposed maps. They must also work actively to identify, understand, and accommodate communities of interest. I hope to go in clear-eyed on the challenges that come with this task and ensure that we make use of the analytical methods available as we work through this difficult, but necessary, process.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In various leadership and non-leadership positions, I have experienced some of the challenges of working with people with deeply held and diverse viewpoints. Staying clear on our purpose and the constraints in which we are operating will be important to keep the team aligned. As I engage, I work to avoid letting my ego get in the way of progress and I try to focus on getting to the best solution (wherever and whoever it is coming from). Being forthright, modeling humility and open-mindedness (by demonstrating a willingness to be swayed by new information), and keeping a goal-orientation can go a long way in eliciting the same behavior from others.

Filter bubbles--political or otherwise--rarely lead their inhabitants to broad-based understanding, much less fairness. Unaffiliated committee members will play an important role in helping hold the committee accountable, provided those (unaffiliated) members can show that they are well-informed and focused on faithfully performing their duty.

As a demonstration of impartiality (or at least an interest in it), I am an intermittent attendee at local house district meetings for both the Republican and Democratic parties. I do that because we all have blindspots, and hearing facts, values, and framings from multiple perspectives can help reveal some of my own blindspots. It has also shown that while the issues that divide us are often amplified in the media and in our minds, when it comes to many of the issues that face us, we have a lot in common.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Early in the COVID pandemic, I actively tracked, plotted, and shared information about the spread of the disease. I derived the formula for the exponential doubling rate to track how effectively we were bending the curve and sent (unsolicited) feedback to CDPHE on discrepancies I found in their data. More recently, to answer growing skepticism and my own uncertainty about whether COVID deaths could have been overstated (conflated with other comorbidities), I sought out data on monthly deaths in the US from all causes over the last 20 years and compared them to provisional data from this year. Plotting it, I was able to convince myself and some of my skeptical friends that this year is, indeed, quite an outlier. 

An analytical approach is in my nature and it is what my internal compass compels.

When possible, I try to go straight to the source(s), using intermediaries, analysts, and pundits in a supporting role. While they all have important information to provide, they also necessarily apply their own filters in selecting, organizing, and interpreting the information they communicate. When possible, I try to identify and ask challenging questions that get at the heart of the matter; ensure that due diligence was performed; and reveal weaknesses in assumptions, methodologies, and in interpretations and results.

Both my formal education and work life (in aerospace and software engineering) have had an analytical skew. My education led me to informal studies of deductive and inductive reasoning (i.e. the reasoning of mathematical proofs and of the sciences, respectively). An interest in political discourse led to informal readings on logical fallacies, cognitive biases, and heuristics, as well as the role of nonrational processes in political persuasion. I am no mathematician, but I do have some experience with (and an interest in) statistics, which I think will come in handy for this work. A recent personality/work styles profile (that I cannot endorse, but will mention) identified “analytical” as my dominant thinking style. And I relish opportunities to use my brain in analytical ways (even in non-standard ways, like in a recent review of professional journal articles on evidence-based volunteer coordination practices).
