        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Michelle Anne Lanzoni</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Michelle Anne Lanzoni
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Michelle Lanzoni</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a geography researcher. I focus on water resources in dryland areas, including those in Colorado. 

I also teach online writing courses through the magazine Creative Nonfiction, and I took temporary work in Colorado with the US Census Bureau. Prior to this, I taught physical and human geography coursework for several years at the university level and conducted scientific research.

</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  PhD, Geography
MSc, Water Science, Policy and Management
MS, Environmental Studies
BA, Biology

I have a doctorate in geography from Oxford and two masters related to environmental studies and water resources. I am proficient in GIS, and I have an interest in the layers of data contained within maps. As a geographer, I have used ArcGIS and satellite data to study population and land-use changes in Colorado.

</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81101
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
As a former grant recipient from Clinton Global Initiatives (Clinton Foundation) for my work on water projects, I have in turn donated to this nonprofit organization in support of its charitable works. 

I have also made contributions to campaigns through my professional organizations advocating for science education in America. Science advocacy is non-partisan and benefits those of any party.

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I volunteer as a board member for the Colorado Field Institute. This is a nonprofit organization dedicated to educating the public about southern Colorado&#39;s natural history, heritage, and cultural resources. It focuses primarily on the San Luis Valley. We organize winter lectures at Adams State University and summer field trips throughout southern Colorado.

I also serve on the board of my college alumni association, Prescott College in Arizona.

My professional memberships include PEN America, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and the American Geophysical Union (AGU), the largest organization for earth and space scientists.

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
During the 2020 Census field campaign, I taught, organized, and led a team of field enumerators in the San Luis Valley, one of the most difficult areas in all of Colorado to count. I was responsible for Costilla, Alamosa, and Saguache Counties. I also led a team performing analytical and quality control measures on the NRFU Census data. This team analyzed Census data received from across southern Colorado including Trinidad and Pueblo. I advocated for the accurate counting of historically under-represented areas, and I worked hard to get as many people as possible counted in the timeframe allowed. This was non-partisan work. 

As a water scientist and well owner in Colorado, I have an interest in, and have considered others’ interests in, Colorado’s water resources. I have attended many water conservation district and water user association meetings, and I have presented my research before some of these groups. 

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My PhD work at Oxford brought me in 2014 to the San Luis Valley. In southern Colorado I spent several years studying precipitation patterns, groundwater chemistry, water flowpaths, and by default—water law. I learned all of these are a changing landscape influenced by human settlement, which in turn, is dependent on physical geography. I saw how physical geography and human geography interact. 

In 2020, I had the opportunity to work for the US Census. While I had previously been involved in my community as a board member for the Colorado Field Institute and had actively participated in water board and water association meetings, the Census offered me my first experience linking community involvement with state and federal representation. To me, it was the clearest demonstration of “democracy in action.” 

The phrase “democracy in action” is often applied to the simple act of voting. No doubt, voting is important. Our country just experienced an election with its highest voter turnout in history. But our Constitution provides for an electoral college system, and the number of Congressional representatives as well as the boundaries of a state’s congressional and legislative districts are all based on data ascertained by the US Census Bureau. 

In 2018, Colorado passed laws providing for a team of independent commissioners tasked with re-drawing district boundaries every ten years based on the most recent Census data. I would like to follow the US Census data for Colorado I helped gather and spent time analyzing. Its next point of usefulness will be to help Colorado reframe its new congressional and legislative boundaries based on changes in settlement patterns and population data. 

I want to use the knowledge and skills I’ve acquired to help determine the map boundaries for Colorado. I want to actively participate in my state’s democratic process. I want to learn more about this process by getting involved directly. Because I am a geographer who loves maps, joining the redistricting commission seems an appropriate and important way for me to serve my community, state, and country.  

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have worked in groups who hold divergent political, religious, and cultural beliefs. I have done so as a teacher, a group leader, and a participant. I am patient and respectful, and I listen to others. I see working in diverse groups as an opportunity to learn the points of view of others and to help communicate clear, logical ideas that can lead to a group consensus. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am a scientist who is comfortable in the use of both qualitative and quantitative analysis. I’ve worked with large data sets, and I am accustomed to analyzing multiple variables and examining data projections through time. I am also practiced at synthesizing data and communicating these in a clear and compelling manner. 

I apply logic and reason in assessing a situation, constructing a verbal or written argument, and in solving problems. I have participated in formal debates, and I teach the use of logical argument and evidence-based research.
