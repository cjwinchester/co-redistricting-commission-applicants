</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
1. I am a lifetime member of Girl Scouts of the USA and have volunteered extensively for Girl Scouts of Colorado.  Since November 2015, my volunteer roles with Girl Scouts have included Board of Directors (2012-2020), Board Treasurer (2018-2019), Board Finance &amp; Audit Committee (2017-2020), Board Governance Committee (2015-2018), a mentor to girls working on their Gold Award projects (2016-present), a trainer of adult volunteers (2008-2018), and Product Sales Manager for Summit and Lake Counties (2015, 2016).

3. I have been elected to two terms on my homeowner’s association board (2016-present), serving as Vice President and then as Treasurer.          

4. I also volunteer for various nonprofits including High Country Conservation Center, Keystone Citizens League, Continental Divide Land Trust (now Colorado Open Lands), and Summit Huts Association.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have worked on a number of statewide initiatives charged with representing the interests of people from across Colorado.          

For example, as a member of the statewide Girl Scout Membership Connection Committee (2008-2014) I helped plan listening sessions for volunteers to share input with the council’s senior leadership.  We met all over Colorado, and I personally facilitated or organized conversations in communities including Olathe, Pueblo, Windsor, Highlands Ranch, Durango, central Denver, Ft Morgan, and Pagosa Springs.  Through those experiences, I learned to draw out common values and needs, and to simultaneously hear and respect the true differences between various areas of the state.          

Particularly relevant to this application, my experience while serving on this committee included a project to redraw the maps that established the council’s governance regions.  After resolving geographic discrepancies between the regions used for management and those used for governing, we identified clusters of communities with like-interests to ensure adequate representation from each area.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Simply put, I want to serve because I believe that good districts make better legislators.  Rather than being beholden to particular interests or groups, impartial maps help ensure that legislators understand, listen to, and act on the interests of ALL their constituents.  Most importantly, I believe that well-drawn districts can help encourage our elected leaders to work together and compromise to find the best solutions for all Coloradoans.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My personal core values are fairness, cooperation, and working for the common good. I will bring these values to my work as a commissioner – without regard for political party.          

When making tough decisions, I seek to listen first.  Rather than presuppose an answer, I ask questions and consider the problem from multiple angles.  Each person’s expertise and experiences are like data points, illuminating an issue’s root causes; therefore, it’s important to me to gather as much input as is feasible.  As a connector of ideas, I’m then able to tie those perspectives together to help groups find common ground, shared values, and mutually agreeable solutions.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I work every day in the analytical fields of finance and accounting, and pride myself on my ability to solve problems with data.  As the top financial officer in my organization, I frequently guide colleagues through complex business issues, helping find patterns in the financials that others don’t see.  I am very comfortable working in large data sets, applying logic, and using software to arrange and analyze information.
