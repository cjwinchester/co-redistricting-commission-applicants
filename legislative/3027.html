        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Anne Bertsch</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Anne Bertsch
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Business Development Executive with Marriott International, Inc.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I hold a B.S. in Human Resources from the University of Delaware (1993), and I have a law degree from Georgetown University Law Center (1998).
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80424
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not been terribly politically active other than as an arm-chair political &quot;junkie&quot;.  Having lived in Washington DC for nearly 20 years before moving to Colorado (in 2014), I suppose you could say I come by it honestly!  I attended every Presidential Inauguration during my tenure in DC.  Watching the peaceful transfer of power is always awe-inspiring!  With respect to monetary donations, I will do my best to answer fully, but I have to admit that I won&#39;t fully remember all the donations I have made.  I believe I donated to Gary Johnson&#39;s presidential campaign in 2016.  I did make a number of donations this year for both the presidential campaign as well as various congressional races (both Senate and House of Representatives) and local races.  I donated to Wisconsin Dems in connection with the table read of The Princess Bride.  I also donated to Joe Biden, Amy McGrath, and Wendy Davis.  I believe I also may have donated to John Hickenlooper and a few others.  I honestly don&#39;t remember them all - I would get emails and sometimes be inspired to donate.  None of them were significant amounts as I recall.  Maybe $25 here, $50 there, etc.  I attended an industry networking lunch with Mayor Hancock maybe two years ago, and I believe I had to provide a donation to attend.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
For a variety of reasons, I haven&#39;t been particularly active in the community since moving to Colorado in 2014. I have participated as an owner in my HOA in Breckenridge.  I attend various industry conferences.  I&#39;ve donated money to some non-profits, like Heart &amp; Hand.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I don&#39;t have any specific experience in this area; however, as a former attorney, I have plenty of experience working as an advocate for my clients!  Prior to moving to Colorado, I was on the board of a homeless services organization for a number of years, and I also was very involved leading Marriott&#39;s corporate partnership with Street Law, Inc.  I submit that my lack of experience in community organizing/special interest groups supports my application as an independent and fair-minded participant on the commission.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
From the time I was 18 years old, I have been a registered independent (or &quot;unaffiliated&quot;) voter - first in Maryland, then in Washington, DC, and now in Colorado.  In fact, I got into a debate with my high school government teacher about my refusal to join a party (I suppose the handwriting was on the wall for my future legal pursuits) - he accused me, in all good humor, of taking the easy way out by not choosing a party.  I proceeded to tell him why I was refusing - that I didn&#39;t think any one party could represent my views completely and that I thought voters would be more involved and informed if we had no parties, or multiple parties, rather than two.  From that time on, I have had concerns about various effects of our two-party system.  One of those negative effects involves the issue of &quot;redistricting&quot; - too often, the parties control the geography and therefore control the destiny of each election.  It renders a vote by someone of the minority party in a district rather useless, which is antithetical to our democratic ideals.  I am excited that Colorado has forged a serious commitment to enacting fair and partisan-free (or as free as possible) voting districts rather than allowing districts to be drawn to the benefit of this political party or that.  I haven&#39;t personally been involved in politics in my life, and this is the first time I have felt called to participate in a substantive way beyond voting and engaging in lively debates with friends and family.  I would like to be of service and lend an independent voice to this very important work.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a committed independent who has voted for Republicans as often as I&#39;ve voted for Democrats - and very often vote for third party candidates - I do not have a particular allegiance to a political party.  My goal would be to ensure that the districts are drawn in as fair and impartial a manner as possible.  As an attorney, my role was to bring together two or more parties with often competing objectives and find common ground to get a deal done.  (In my 16+ years practicing law, I was a corporate deal lawyer.)  While my allegiance was first and foremost to my client, I was called on to bridge gaps and find common ground solutions.  As a business executive in my current role, I continue to hone my negotiating and bridge-building skills as I work to secure deals on behalf of my company.  I am required to find win-win solutions to difficult and sometimes complex problems.  The only way to achieve these goals is to build consensus even when the parties are at loggerheads.  This experience will serve me well in facilitating consensus building among the commissioners.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I possess very strong analytical skills - analysis and critical thinking are the bread and butter of any successful attorney.  In my role as a lawyer, I excelled at drafting complicated contractual provisions and analyzing factual scenarios to determine what legal issues may be implicated and then analyzing what course of action is most advisable based on the factors in play.  All of this required me to understand the legal rules and requirements that were applicable to a given situation and then analyze and apply the relevant facts to those rules to make a determination and recommendation to the client about how to best resolve the particular issue or problem.  I still utilize those skills as I evaluate and underwrite potential hotel projects, including financial performance and underwriting.
