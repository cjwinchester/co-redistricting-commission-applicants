  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently retired from the practice of law in Colorado. My Colorado attorney registration is now inactive.  I served as the County Attorney for San Miguel County, Colorado, from 1994 until my retirement in February 2018.  Prior to that position I served as the La Plata County Attorney from 1985to 1990, and as an Assistant Garfield County Attorney from 1981to 1985, and in 1993. I served as an attorney in the Colorado Rural Legal Services program in Trinidad and Grand Junction, Colorado from 1978 to 1981.  A copy of my professional resume, which was prepared while I was residing in Telluride, CO, prior to my moving to Ridgway in 2002, is attached.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I received my Bachelor of Arts degree, with Honors, majoring in History, from Harpur College,  State University of New York at Binghamton, in 1974.  I received my Juris Doctor degree from the University of Colorado School of Law in Boulder in 1977, following which I received my Master in Public Administration, Mid-Career Program, degree from the Harvard University Kennedy School of Government, in 1991.  I recently received the Law School Alumni Council&#39;s 2020 Distinguished Alumni Achievement - Public Sector Award.

<h5>Zip Code</h5>

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In addition to voting in the 2016, 2018, and 2019 general elections by past political activity has been primarily limited to donating money to various political candidates&#39; campaigns and political organizations.  My political contributions since November 10, 2015 were made to the following political candidates campaigns and political organizations:  Joe Biden, Michael Bennet, Diane Mitsch Bush, Gail Schwartz, Mark Kelly, Jacky Rosen, Jon Tester, John Hickenlooper, James Iacino, Heidi Heitkamp, Barbara McLachlan, Let America Vote PAC, Giffords PAC - IE, Mark Udall, Democratic National Committee, Yes on National Popular Vote, End Citizens United, Kamala Harris, Bill Nelson, PAC to the Future, Jared Golden, and Nancy Pelosi. I worked as a volunteer for Colorado state representative Barbara McLachlan&#39;s 2020 reelection campaign.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
During my years of service as a county and assistant county attorney I belonged to the Colorado County Attorneys Association, including two terms on its board of directors, as well as a member of the Colorado Bar Association.  I ceased participating in those organizations upon my retirement in 2018.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
In my capacity as a county attorney, and assistant attorney, in San Miguel, La Plata, and Garfield counties I obtained considerable experience representing and advocating for the interests of those county governments and their elected officials, before Colorado legislative bodies and regulatory agencies pertaining to various public policy matters. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
After more than thirty years of public service in county governments in Colorado, involving a wide variety of public policy matters,  I believe that I have significant relevant professional knowledge and experience that would be beneficial to the commission&#39;s redistricting responsibilities.  Service on the commission would provide me with the opportunity to contribute to the political health and well being of Colorado&#39;s citizens. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
During my more than thirty years of public service in county government in Colorado a considerable amount of my time and effort was devoted to promoting consensus and creating agreement between various county elected officials, including county commissioners and other county elected and appointed officials on a wide variety of public policy and non-policy matters.  As legal counsel to boards of county commissioners a paramount consideration was providing the members of those boards with fair and impartial advice and guidance on legally and politically sensitive matters.  As an attorney whose clients included both elected and appointed public officials I was always cognizant that my role was not that of a policy maker, as that responsibility resided with the various public officials to whom I provided legal counsel.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Over the course of a forty year legal career I have had the opportunity to use my legal training and analytical skills, including the application of logic and reason to a wide variety of legal matters, including litigating matters in both Colorado state and federal courts.  I have litigated a wide variety of legal matters involving county government in both trial and appellate courts, including the Colorado Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.  Providing legal counsel and advice to various county officials frequently involved the use of various legal analytical skills in both the development of policy as well as its implementation.  I applied my legal analytical skills to advising the board of county commissioners regarding the decennial redistricting of the county commissioner districts in San Miguel County following the 2000 and 2010 census.
