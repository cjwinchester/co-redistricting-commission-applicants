        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Samuel David Greenidge</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Samuel David Greenidge
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I teach K-12 mathematics as Lead Instructor at the Mathnasium of Longmont.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I hold a Associates in Science from Front Range Community College. I am currently a student at CU expecting to graduate with a Bachelor&#39;s of Arts in Mathematics in spring of 2021. As part of my studies I&#39;m taking a class from Professor Jeanne Clelland which covers the mathematical aspects of redistricting, with a focus on using ensemble analysis and historical data to test the fairness of electoral maps.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80504
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I have not been particular active in the public sphere previously, so while I&#39;m eager to consider the interests of all groups impartially, I imagine this is a skill I will learn through my experience on the commission rather than something I bring to the table.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have never donated to or volunteered with a political campaign. As a long term resident of Weld County I&#39;ve grown up in a predominantly Republican environment, and as a student at Front Range and CU-Boulder, I&#39;ve been educated in a predominantly Democratic environment. After voting along party lines in my first election (though I remained unaffiliated) and seeing the outcome I made a personal commitment to vote for a mix of Democratic, Republican, and Third Party Candidates in each election, a commitment which I have carried out in both the 2018 and 2020 elections.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am a young and generally private person so I&#39;ve had limited involvement with volunteer organizations, neighborhood associations, professional organizations, or appointed boards.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
It sounds like an unusual sort of adventure. I was thrilled when I first saw amendments Y and Z on a ballot, and I would be equally thrilled to help fulfill their vision of a truly independent and objectively fair voting map. I&#39;m also one of the few people in Colorado old enough to serve on the commission, but young enough to have studied the mathematics of redistricting in school. I believe it is essential that someone with that technical experience be on the commission, in order to provide the commission with the tools to create an objectively fair map.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a teacher it&#39;s my job to communicate complicated ideas in an accessible way. I listen to my students and seek to understand and root out the causes of misunderstandings. I&#39;m also a generally friendly person who can discuss political issues in an apolitical way. I see the flaws in both major parties, but I also understand the noble sentiments and sensible reasoning which leads them to their respective views of government. As such I can act as a political translator who can decode the reasoning of a Republican to a Democrat, and the reasoning of a Democrat to a Republican, and hopefully lead both back to the common ground this commission will be built on.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In general my mathematics education and personal temperament make me well suited to solving complex analytical problems. In the case of electoral maps specifically I have a detailed understanding of the metrics which can be used to judge electoral maps, their limitations, and even some recent case law. I also have experience with the Gerrychain software developed by the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering group of Tufts University and MIT. I can use it both to measure the qualities of a given map (compactness, competitiveness, proportionality) and to perform an ensemble analysis. This technique involves teaching a computer to draw several billion legal maps that then serve as a representative sample that you can compare any given map against. My core concern is that the map drawn by the commission fairly represents the population of Colorado and has neutral to no impact on the outcome of future elections.
