        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Denise de Percin</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Denise de Percin
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>I mostly use my nickname, &quot;Dede&quot; de Percin</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently the executive director of the Mile High Health Alliance, a nonprofit organization focused on improving access to healthcare in Denver. As a young nonprofit, we operate as a project partner of the Colorado Nonprofit Development Center, and technically are employed by them. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I received my BA from Cornell University in History of Science (Ithaca, NY) and my Master&#39;s in Nonprofit Management from Regis University (Denver, CO). I have additional training in nonviolent civil disobedience, leadership, and social justice. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80223
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My political activism started early, when I led a student walk-out at my junior high school at the age of thirteen. I participated in the first Take Back the Night march in Ithaca, NY in 1979. A picture of me being arrested at the U.S. Supreme Court for nonviolent civil disobedience appeared in Time magazine in 1989. I have been arrested three times for civil disobedience and contributed to a book of essays on the subject. 

Since arriving in Colorado in 1998, my political activities have been more conventional. I have been involved with and contributed to many issue and candidate campaigns. These efforts have always been unpaid and included activities such as answering phones, making calls, sending texts, delivering yard signs, showing up at press events, social media posts, etc. 

While executive director of the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, I was a registered lobbyist in Colorado (2006 – 2013). As an organization, we engaged in both direct and indirect lobbying at the state level, working with coalition partners to prepare strategies, communications, data, and connect policy to personal stories. Also while with CCHI, I was involved with helping ensure passage and subsequent protection of the Affordable Care Act, as well as expansion of Medicaid. 

At the Western Conservation Foundation, I was responsible for developing and implementing strategies – but not lobbying – to influence policymakers to augment and protect environmental and recreational flows in the Colorado River. 

This year I volunteered as an “election guardian,” which involved watching a polling place for incidences of voter harassment or intimidation. In 2018 I drove people who needed rides to the polls on election day. I was part of election protection activities in 2012, the year that there were many problems with voting and very long lines at polling places. I answered calls on election day – I don’t remember which year - from people who needed information about how and where to vote. I  also collaborated on a voter registration campaign when working with the Colorado Anti-Violence Program. 

I do not have a complete list of donations dating back to 2105, because I never anticipated needing that information. However, most of my  contributions were made through the Act Blue online platform. I have pulled that list and included it as an attachment to my application.

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
It is difficult to briefly summarize my experience in these areas, because it literally is the work I have done personally and professionally for years. In the 20+ years I have lived in Denver, I have been involved with LGBTQ+  and women’s rights; sexual, domestic, and hate violence; environmental and recreational water rights: private and public insurance reform and health system reform, and racial equity and social justice, among other issues. My life has been centered on organizing, advocacy, representation, coalition building and transforming systems. I am invested and committed to contributing to advancing the rights and interests of communities and people who historically have not had equal power and privilege. 

By way of a specific example, for 7 years I ran the statewide LGBTQ+ anti-violence program in Colorado, a position that included providing direct services to people who had experienced violence and crime, recruiting and training volunteers for the hotline, working with law enforcement and criminal justice, educating widely about LGBTQ+ issues, and advocating for changes in laws and policies. I moved to Colorado from Wyoming, where I had worried to pass hate crimes legislation, to direct the anti-violence program two months before Matthew Shepard was murdered. It was my responsibility to organize vigils, be a spokesperson, and understand the wishes and needs of family members. It was also my responsibility to get accurate information to community members and the press, not make assumptions, and simultaneously collaborate with law enforcement and hold them accountable. This experience was repeated with the murder of Fred Martinez in Cortez and the vicious attack on Kyle Skyock near Rifle. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
When the announcement came out, I thought serving on the Commission would be interesting. Colorado has a unique voter mix: roughly one third democratic, independent, and republican. Colorado also has a new a more impartial system in place for redistricting that we will be using for the first time based on the results of the 2020 Census. My organization did significant work to ensure hard-to-count populations responded to and were represented in the 2020 Census. I’m invested in ensuring that the census results, which determine resources, representation, and so much more, are fairly implemented. 

I believed that there would be candidates who are more qualified and better represented the diversity of our state; that still may be true. But there are significant barriers to serving on the restricting Commission: the strict eligibility criteria are designed to ensure impartiality, but also eliminated some of the most qualified people. Serving on the commission will also take a significant investment of time, which is a privilege not everyone has.

As the application deadline neared, reports about the lack of diversity among those who applied were, quite frankly, alarming. Unless things have changed, the candidate pool is overwhelming older, white, and male, which does not reflect the population of our state. I am not a particularly diverse candidate. I am white, older and live in Denver. I am also female, queer, and have spent my life in the social justice space, learning and thinking about issues of equity and privilege. I can’t speak for people with different experiences and backgrounds, but I can try to ensure that their perspectives are heard. 

Colorado will embark on the redistricting process in the context of unprecedented political polarization, vitriol, and anger, as well as heightened demands for equity and justice. We need to get this first redistricting process right to help narrow the divisions among Coloradans, and so that our residents have confidence in the results. Colorado leads in so many ways and on so many issues. The recent elections demonstrated the power of putting in place systems that work well for all residents. In a similar vein a successful redistricting process can be a model for other states. 

These are the reasons I am interested in serving on the Commission. It is also a partial explanation for my last-minute application. I have not been able to get the optional letters of recommendation because I, along with the people I would have asked, have been largely preoccupied with the elections and their outcomes. If there is an option to submit these as follow up, or to provide a list of references, I would welcome the opportunity. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The mission of the nonprofit I currently lead is achieving better health through collaboration. Collaboration is not just the what we do but also the how. Relationships are everything; quoting one of my board members, “progress proceeds at the pace of trust.”  Finding alignment, getting to agreement, and moving people toward consensus is my avocation. 

On the boards I have served on, decisions have predominantly been made through consensus, quasi-consensus, or by a super majority.  My experience has been that when it comes to important or contentious issues, a simple majority vote is insufficient to move forward productively and without resentment. 

I facilitated meetings at CCHI, which operated through quasi-consensus of our 30+ members. This required patience, perseverance, and optimism. There were some issues we could not reach a decision on, or could only reach consensus to be neutral. But the process made our influence and commitment stronger. At the Capitol and elsewhere people understood that CCHI’s membership was solidly behind our position and advocacy. 

I have been in numerous situations where I was unwelcome, but still had to find a way to get the work done. I worked in construction in both Washington, D.C. and Wyoming. I was the only woman on the site and responses of the men ranged from indifference to resentment to active dislike; mostly the latter. I trained at new recruits at the Denver Police Academy about violence within and against LGBTQ+ communities. As for lobbying – persuading and compromising is central to success. I’m used to conditions where it is difficult to make progress, achieve outcomes, be productive, and shift perspectives. 

The tools and experience that give me the ability to step back, see other points of view, and find a way forward together have been developed over a lifetime of collectively reaching difficult and crucial decisions. I would like to bring this expertise to the Commission. Fairness is grounded in respect for all the people in the room, the assumption of good intent, and understanding of the impact of a decision on individuals and communities.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My undergraduate degree is in History of Science, which requires a broad understanding in many areas – I took classes in physics, biology, astronomy, math, geology, and philosophy of quantum mechanics. This major required the capacity to be highly analytical coupled with the ability to discover and understand patterns, along with a dose of creativity. In addition, I’m naturally strategic thinker, and make connections among seemingly unrelated ideas. These attributes not only help me apply logic and reason, but also contribute to finding solutions.  

The work of nonprofit organizations is grounded in logic models, which construct a series of inputs, outputs, and outcomes to illustrate how specific activities lead to desired results. They are the basis for our strategic planning and programming. The skills that I have in developing, implementing, and evaluating logic models will be useful in the context of discussions and decisions by the Commission.
