</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a Precinct Leader it was ultimately my job to help get the people of my party and unaffiliated voters understand how important it was to get out and vote, especially for the parties downline, even if you didn&#39;t like who was running for president. I came up with a couple of innovative ways to be another touch to the voters besides house-to-house as past Precinct Leaders had done. As a member of the Professional Photo Managers, it is important for me to be informed of the latest techniques and projects. Continuous training and letting my clients know about what I do helps keep my skills relevant and gets the word out about this fairly new industry. As an Election Judge it was important that everyone get the opportunity to vote. My party affiliation did not play a role in doing my job.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe it is my civic and moral duty to help out where I can and I really enjoy it. It is truly in my soul to give of my time.The redistricting process is so important to ensure the boundaries are set up fairly and not skewed one way or another.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Promoting consensus and creating agreement begins with everyone having the facts, having their thoughts heard, and being able to see both sides. Having worked on many committees over the years I have learned that it is all part of a balancing act with some give and some take. This all plays into being fair and impartial through communication. As an Election Judge during this last election, I did not have any problems registering someone that was not of the same party. I strongly feel that it is important for everyone to have their say.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am very logically and math minded. This has served me well as a computer programer and now as a Professional Photo Manager. I am able to analyse a large project and break it up into smaller steps. For instance, in my job it is very common for someone to give me several bins of loose photos. At the end of an hour of discussing the photos and what she would like done with them we come up with a plan (or smaller projects) and prioritize them. Many times she will not have even known what she wanted and I am able to give other suggestions. I then take the photos, which initially usually involves organizing them in some way. I do an overview and somewhat of a deep dive into everything she has given me. If the first step is to organize, I decide at what level (decade, year) to do that. Should I take apart the old albums first. Should we get the outdated movies and slides converted. There is analysis, logic &amp; reason that goes into each of those decisions based facts that the client has or has not given me.
