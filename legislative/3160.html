<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Previous to my work in energy, I worked for elected officials at the state and federal level in Wyoming. All three of these representatives took enormous pride and responsibility in listening to all residents and reprsenting what was best for the state. 

Since I began working in oil and gas, it has been my ultimate goal to understand the concerns from neighbors and other stakeholders when it comes to energy development. There are many different viewpoints and priorities when it comes to nearby energy development. Especially in my work for Anadarko and Occidental in Colorado, we develop near highly populated areas and therefore hearing the concerns of those that live and work near our operations is imperitive but more importantly, taking action to mitigate the impact and reducing their concerns is the highest priority. We don&#39;t get to pick our neighbors in oil and gas, we go where the minerals are in the ground, therefore we must make dialogue and compromise our highest goal. Outside of oil and gas, I worked briefly for a developer of multi-family housing. This is also an industry that survivies by being good neighbors and listening to the concerns of those affected by our activity. We cannot make our plans work without the buy in from the community and stakeholders. In all my work, I have always prioritized a civil and constructive conversation. There is always common ground to be had and always things to learn from others. 
Away from work, I take tremendous pride in helping my friends and neighbors understand the political process and what is on thier ballot. Most people don&#39;t have a lot of time therefore they ask me. I am confident my friends and neighbors would agree that I present unbiased and factual information. I do not push my beliefs but rather direct them to the facts and reasons for what they are seeing on the ballot. I have been told my many of my opposite-party friends that I am able to present things in a clear and helpful way without sharing my own perspective. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have been in love with politics since I was eight years old. I have studied the process, work in the industry, and marveled at the changes that have occured in this country both over hundreds of years and just since I have worked in the field. I am continually amazed at the resiliancy of democracy. However, the division between the parties and demonization of those that believe differently has become a significant threat to our political system. Amendment Y and Z that created these commissions are trying to do something about this issue. I want to help right the ship and bring faith back into politics. The beauty of democracy is it only works if the people who are represented believe it in and the only way to beleive is by those same people engaging in democracy. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I like to abide by the Rule of 80: We will agree on 80% so focus on that, not the 20% where we disagree. However, in today&#39;s political environment the numbers may be reversed. But that still leaves us 20% and you can build on anything if you have 20% to start. Party affiliation is largely a construct of a two party system: you pick one side even if you don&#39;t agree with everything. Now, with an Unaffiliated party growing, we are able to better see different perspectives and paths forward. I would put aside personal party registration of the members and focus on the task at hand which is to create a fair district map for elections. If we all have the same goal, as required by selection to this commission, we can find that common ground. Discussion and debate is healthy and fostering an open and honest environment for disagreement is key to finding that common ground. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Politics is and always has been a numbers game. It may appear charismatic or powerful but in reality, crunching the numbers is the way things get done in this field. Whether it is analyzing budget numbers, working out the economics on a new well, or looking at tax rates, I have always found facts to be abundent in raw numbers. When it comes to logic, one must look outside their own beliefs to see the world as it is to others. My work in politics and government is a function of logic and reason: what can get done, how, with whom, and when can it get done. Anything besides pragmatic resourcefulness is a waste of time.  Analyzing the baseline of an issue helps you understand how it can be made better.
