        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Joseph Paul Cantalini</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Joseph Paul Cantalini
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Cannabis Consultant, self employed, having worked in cannabis for nearly eight years, including regulations and compliance, in cooperation with policymakers, and having served on over 10 city and state cannabis rulemaking and advisory workgroups.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  MBA, MA-Chemistry, BS-Biology &amp; Chemistry, Spanish-English Translation Certificate, Compliance &amp; Ethics Professional Certificate
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80203
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In November of 2018 and again in October of 2020 I donated to several democrat campaigns, nearly all out of the state of Colorado.  I made these donations not because of a commitment to any candidate or race in particular, but because I was troubled by the lack of character, decorum, decency, tolerance, and ethics I perceived in the President of the United States. I hoped these donations would advantage US Senate and House races key to providing an offsetting check and balance to the President.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I was a board director for the Marijuana Industry Group from 2014-2019.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
During my service as a board director for the Marijuana Industry Group, I was Vice Chair for nearly three years and was presented with a certificate of appreciation by that group in recognition of exemplary service in advancing pragmatic policy. Also, as mentioned above, I have served on over 10 city and state cannabis rulemaking and advisory workgroups, where, I have been chosen and commended for dedicated service, for principled and pragmatic impartiality, and for an ability to promote understanding and consensus.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the commission because I believe that objective and unbiased districts are critical to our democracy, because I relish serving society and promoting the greater good and because as a scrupulous and altruistic citizen, throughout my life guided by reason, science, and jurisprudence, I know that I will be an excellent and impartial commissioner and that I my participation will benefit Coloradans.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Successfully acting in this role will call upon my ability to build rapport and work professionally with various stakeholders in delicate circumstances and to offer thoughtful, well-reasoned, and unbiased assessments and solutions.  Fairness and impartiality and thoughtfulness and well-reasoned understanding and perspective are keys to the way in which I relate to people, appreciate them and their views, and build trust.  Tolerance, asking questions, listening, and demonstrating knowledge are also important to building trust and seeking common ground, all things I have demonstrated and been chosen for repeatedly on the various rulemaking and advisory committees, which are made of up various stakeholders with differing perspectives.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am, first and foremost, a scrupulous, altruistic, and logic- and science-driven citizen, in the social-contract sense of the word. I am interested in contributing my objectivity and my analytical, deductive, and reasoning skills to this committee in order to serve the public.
As a learner, scientist, and knowledge seeker, analysis, logic, and understanding are crucial to how I approach and relate to the world.  Successfully acting in this role will call upon my leadership, specifically as a servant leader, and ability to build rapport and work professionally with various stakeholders and in both harmonious and delicate circumstances, something I have demonstrated and been chosen for repeatedly on the various rulemaking and advisory committees, which are made of up various stakeholders.
