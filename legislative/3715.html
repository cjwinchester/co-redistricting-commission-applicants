<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have served as a Signature Verification Election Judge for Arapahoe County Elections Division for three years.  In that capacity, as part of bipartisan teams, I verify that the voters’ ballot signatures for the current election match previous known signatures so the ballots can be tabulated.  I have written postcards and distributed literature house-to-house in support of candidates running in my districts for Colorado&#39;s elected offices. I have contributed to these organizations:  Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Democratic  National Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Emily&#39;s List, Senate Majority PAC, Biden Victory Fund.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I belong to the American Association of University Women, District 38 Democratic Party, Colorado Adult Education Professional Association and Colorado Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (COTESOL).
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I worked at the Colorado Dept. of Education, Adult Education and Family Literacy unit for 13 years. I trained adult education teachers in communities across Colorado so they could teach math and language skills to adults earning GEDs or immigrants learning English. I served two years on the COTESOL Board as the Adult Education coordinator. In that capacity I identified innovative ESL teachers across the state and recruited them for our annual statewide convention so teachers across Colorado could benefit from their expertise. In retirement, I am the Recording Secretary and serve on the Board of the Littleton South-Metro branch of American Association of University Women. We advocate locally and in Colorado for equity for girls and women in education, economic security and leadership.  I serve as the coordinator for several interest groups of that organization.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Fair elections are the keystone of our democracy. I want to serve Colorado by creating districts that fairly represent the communities therein. I want to help create districts whose silhouettes look like turtles, not snakes. Elected officials will be more responsive to the needs and wants of all Colorado residents if we create districts that encompass roughly equal numbers of voters from the major political parties and unaffiliated voters. In addition, districts should take into account the demographics of age, race, and ethnicity. I want to contribute my skills to creating districts that will best serve democracy in Colorado and the nation. My presentation skills developed during many years as a teacher trainer across Colorado will serve the Commission as it gathers input from communities and then presents its results to residents across the state. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my work for the Colorado Department of Education I facilitated several multi-year work groups that brought together teachers and administrators from across CO to create policies, processes, systems, documents, and trainings. One of my strengths is my listening skills. I focus intently on what a person says. I understand that people’s diverse viewpoints are valuable contributions to the group’s ultimate goal; thus, all viewpoints must be acknowledged and respected. At the outset of any discussion or project, I strive to clearly articulate the stances positioned at the ends of a spectrum. Then I work to help people identify common goals and strategies that are found near the mid-point of the spectrum. I always believe there is a middle ground where everyone gets some of their needs met and everyone gives up some of their wants so that others can have some of their needs met. I am a logical thinker, as opposed to emotional responder, so I am able to identify pros and cons of an issue and help people evaluate them. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a young adult, I worked many years as a technical writer in the oilfield and telecommunications industries. Technical writing demands organization, precision, detail, and thoroughness in order to write procedures and instructions that are complete and easily understood by the reader. At the Colorado Department of Education I was lead writer for many policy and process documents. These documents required clear explanations of the goals and benefits, thorough descriptions of the policies, and precisely articulated steps for the processes. Similarly, I designed trainings for teachers across Colorado. I started by reading the current research on adult learning and effective teaching techniques. I selected the relevant research findings and presented them in an organized and comprehensible manner to teachers. Then I designed practice activities to demonstrate the techniques. I took great care to assure that all steps in a teaching technique were clearly explained so teachers felt confident using them when they returned to their classrooms. My analytic and writing skills will be of great benefit to the Redistricting Committee.
