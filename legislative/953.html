        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Jeffrey F. Reiman</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Jeffrey F. Reiman
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>none</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I&#39;ve been retired since June.  For the 10 years before then, I was a Social Studies teacher at Grandview High School in the Cherry Creek School District in Aurora, CO.  During that time I also occasionally worked on a contract basis for Educational Testing Service to write AP exam questions in AP U.S. Government &amp; Politics and AP Comparative Government &amp; Politics, and also worked on a contract basis with the publishing firm Bedford, Freeman &amp; Worth to help edit a textbook now widely used in teaching AP U.S. Government &amp; Politics.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  B.A. in Political Science from the State University of New York at Buffalo (1973)
J.D. from Harvard Law School (1976)
Teacher Education Program from the University of Denver resulting in a teaching certificate (2001)
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80111
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
As a first year attorney, I participated in my own small way in assisting others who were then luminaries in the Colorado legal community to create the Colorado Lawyers Committee.  Later in my law practice, I joined the Board of Directors of the Lawyers Committee.  I&#39;ve contributed to that organization for decades, continuing to do so throughout my teaching career and even in retirement.  And in coordination with the Lawyers Committee, I served as one of three lead counsel in Hafer v. Romer (1990), in which I represented a group of school districts, school administrators, parents of school-age children, and taxpayers who collectively challenged the constitutionality of the then-existing system of funding public schools in Colorado.  My colleagues and I pursued that lawsuit for many months, and achieved our clients&#39; main goals when the Colorado General Assembly enacted a far more equitable formula for financing public education throughout the state that -- while not perfect by any means -- nevertheless dramatically reduced the funding disparity between property-rich and property-poor school districts.     

Also, while I was actively practicing law, I volunteered extensively for the Colorado Bar Association, serving on its Ethics Committee for 15 years and its Grievance Policy Committee for 5 years, and serving as Chair of the latter. 

Finally, since retiring from teaching, I&#39;ve reactivated my law license for the sole purpose of performing pro bono work through Colorado Legal Services.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Following a brief foray into campus politics, which I mention in my resume, I turned to helping others reach their political goals.  Over the years I&#39;ve volunteered at a low organizational level on many political campaigns, including Barack Obama&#39;s (2008 and 2012), Hillary Clinton&#39;s (2016), and Joe Biden&#39;s (2020) presidential runs.  Since retiring, I&#39;ve devoted roughly 200 hours to the Biden campaign focusing on the battleground state of Wisconsin, mostly on a special assignment to increase voter access in Democratic-leaning areas of that state by enlisting 16 and 17-year old high school students to serve as poll workers -- something permitted under Wisconsin law.  To accomplish that, I helped as needed to coordinate the efforts of teachers, principals, school superintendents, and municipal clerks in key regions throughout Wisconsin.  

As for political donations, since November 10, 2015 I&#39;ve contributed money to the following campaigns: Hillary Clinton for President, Joe Biden for President, Andrew Romanoff for Senate (primary campaign), John Hickenlooper for Senate (general election campaign), Jason Crow for House of Representatives (CO -- 6th CD),  Hillary Scholten for House of Representatives (MI -- 3rd CD), and Christina Finello for House of Representatives (PA -- 1st CD).  As I interpret the term &quot;political organizations,&quot; since November 2015 I&#39;ve contributed to three PACs (the Committee to Protect Medicare PAC, A Woman&#39;s Place PAC, and the Lincoln Project) and four other organizations (the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Planned Parenthood, the Sierra Club, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)) that I gladly supported precisely because of their political activities.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
(1) Since November 10, 2015 I&#39;ve been a member of the National Council for the Social Studies, an organization promoting the teaching of civic education.  (2) During that same time, in the course of teaching AP U.S. Government &amp; Politics, I worked closely with (and contributed to) the Colorado Center for Civic Learning and Engagement which sponsors the We the People program in Colorado.  We the People is a nationwide competition of constitutional analysis, and is the single best educational program I&#39;ve encountered.  I&#39;ll briefly describe this program elsewhere in this application, though Judge Daniel Taubman and Andrea Shpall, in their letters of recommendation accompanying my application, shed further light on what it encompasses.  (3) My community includes my synagogue, where for many years I&#39;ve regularly served as a Gabbai responsible for ensuring the Torah is read correctly, and I also serve as an occasional Torah reader.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
First, because doing so reflects who I am.  It sounds like serving on the commission will involve hard work for the public&#39;s benefit in exchange for little pay.  That&#39;s exactly what I did as a teacher for the past 19 years.  

Second, because I have a particular interest in the commission&#39;s goals.  I studied Political Science in school, and have had a lifelong fascination with that topic.  Two of the courses I taught for many years, AP U.S. Government &amp; Politics and AP Human Geography, address the issue of gerrymandering.  And my teaching of We the People required that I become familiar with the constitutional, legal, and political issues involved in drawing political boundaries, including one-person-one-vote, the need for contiguity, a preference for compactness and communities of interest, and the Supreme Court&#39;s creative distinction between racial gerrymandering (prohibited in Shaw v. Reno (1993)) and political gerrymandering (allowed in Rucho v. Common Cause (2019)) even though there&#39;s a clear correlation between race and political leanings.  I want to do my part to enhance democratic principles in Colorado, so it can serve as a model for the country.

Third, because I have ample time to devote to the commission&#39;s work now that I&#39;m retired.  And I have the good fortune to be healthy and energetic enough to handle the workload.

And fourth, because I&#39;m confident I can serve faithfully and honorably, helping to produce a map that the people of Colorado can take pride in.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
A former student gave me a T-shirt that reads, &quot;Teachers do what lawyers do, only with less pay, more judges, and a tougher jury.&quot;  I wear that shirt with pride.  Teenagers are the hardest audience imaginable.  They&#39;re going through profound physical and psychological changes, while also struggling to find their own identity and their place in the world.  And to compound matters, my students came from highly diverse households, racially, ethnically, linguistically, religiously, economically, and politically.  

Promoting consensus is necessary to succeed as a high school teacher.  So is the need to make each student feel as though they&#39;re being treated fairly and impartially.  The first step in reaching any student is to make her/him feel welcome, part of a supportive learning environment.  I learned early in my teaching career that if I treat my students with honesty, honor, and respect -- if I love them for who they are, see what they&#39;re capable of becoming, and model how they can get there -- they&#39;d walk through fire to achieve their goals.  And my approach to teaching worked.  My students enjoyed overwhelming success over the course of my 19-year teaching career, with 97% of them passing their AP exams despite a nationwide pass rate of (depending on the exam and year) roughly between 50 and 60%.  I took particular pride in the success enjoyed by my students of color, many of whom had been underserved in their earlier schooling.  (Grandview has never imposed any prerequisites or academic requirements for any student to enroll in its AP courses, and has actively encouraged all students, no matter their background, to sign up for them.)  And along the way, I received many teaching awards, among them Teacher of the Year at Grandview High School, Teacher of the Year for the Cherry Creek School District, Social Studies Teacher of the Year for the State of Colorado, and even Social Studies Teacher of the Year for the United States.  

I&#39;m applying here for a spot on a redistricting commission, not another teaching award.  But to appreciate how I can build consensus, create agreement within a diverse group, and interact with others fairly and impartially, it will help you to understand how I succeeded in doing these precise things with the toughest audience I&#39;ve ever encountered.  

Teaching the subject of government requires a particular focus on fairness and impartiality.  I taught in a community whose political views spanned the political spectrum.  In his accompanying letter of recommendation, my former principal and district superintendent Harry Bull writes about my desire to give credence to right-of-center as well as left-of-center political loyalties.  Though I openly rejected fringe viewpoints from both ends of the spectrum, I never considered my classroom to be a political platform.  To the contrary, I always believed that my role as a teacher was to prod the students to learn how to think, not what to think.  That was best exemplified by the large sign in my classroom on the wall that faced my door and greeted every student each day upon entering my room, containing one word: &quot;Think . . . . .&quot;   This should give you a sense of my willingness to respect the logic of a political position I happen not to share.  Doing so will be crucial to working with Republicans and Independents on the commission.  

Moreover, I watched the results of consensus-building -- and honed my own talents at achieving it -- in the course of guiding my students for over 10 years through the We the People program.  Participation in that program was a required component of my year-long course in AP U.S. Government &amp; Politics.  It will help you, in assessing my application, to understand what that remarkable program encompasses.  You can learn about it by accessing https://www.civiced.org/we-the-people, though Judge Taubman and Ms. Shpall add insight about it in their letters of recommendation.  

Students enrolled in We the People are assigned to six small groups that analyze the Constitution from different perspectives, including its historic and philosophical underpinnings, how it operates in theory and in practice, and what constitutional issues are particularly relevant in the 21st Century.  Because the program&#39;s organizers address different constitutional issues each year, I immersed myself in widespread constitutional analysis to a far greater extent than I had ever done in my law practice or even in my Constitutional Law course taken in 1974.  But by far, the greatest challenge I encountered in that program was teaching my students the art of consensus building.  Each grouping of students was called upon to make a coherent, cooperative presentation to a panel of judges; and in fact, per the WTP scoring formula, the judges would deduct points if any individual student tried to hoard the spotlight at the expense of his or her group mates.  

And so, in the course of over 10 years, working with six WTP groups each year, I helped over 60 groupings of students reach consensus on a wide variety of complex issues.  That required a great deal of time and effort, as Judge Taubman and Ms. Shpall detail in their letters, calling upon me to contribute emotional support as well as constitutional analysis; but I&#39;m enormously proud of the success my students enjoyed each year, where they placed either first or second in the State of Colorado and participated in two WTP national competitions, each time winning awards for their presentations.  (We were invited to Washington a third time this past spring, yet another event interrupted by COVID.)  

Finally, my ability to interact with others, including -- in the context of this application -- other members of the commission can be seen in one additional way.  I&#39;m proud to say that while I was teaching, many of my former students would go out of their way to stay in touch.  For reasons I could never fully explain, my former students living in the area would frequently return to Grandview, to share with me their college experiences, to ask for my analysis of current events bearing on issues we&#39;d studied in class, and to show off their significant other, their spouse, and occasionally even their kids.  And former students, including those living out of state and abroad, would often communicate as well via email.  Just last week, for instance, a former student who graduated in 2010 emailed me an invitation to his upcoming wedding.  One of my favorite emails was received last year from a former student who had graduated from Grandview in 2007.  That former student, who is now a Social Studies teacher in Utah, wanted to share with me the lessons he&#39;d learned in my classroom about how to teach.  After detailing a number of my teaching methods, recounted with remarkable accuracy twelve years after the fact, this former student concluded with this: &quot;My students may not know your name, but they know a lot about the kind of teacher you are, because it determines so much about the kind of teacher I try to be.&quot;  This testimonial is gratifying and humbling, but it also speaks volumes about how I treat others.  

I try to respect everyone I encounter.  But respecting others doesn&#39;t mean kowtowing to them.  I&#39;ll no doubt disagree on occasion with some of my fellow commissioners.  That will require give-and-take, and hopefully an ability to convince the commission as a whole of the strength of my logic.  I promise to hold true to what I believe, but also to listen carefully to opposing viewpoints in order to try to achieve a consensus that will advance the interests of all Coloradans.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I had the good fortune to receive the best legal training imaginable, not merely from a fine law school but also from two of the most insightful and analytical attorneys I&#39;ve ever known: Hardin Holmes and Ken Starr (the lawyer, not the judge, though I appeared before the judge when he sat on the D.C. Circuit).  In the course of a 25-year law career, my analytical horizons were broadened by the opportunity to work with law colleagues of differing races, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations, as well as by a diverse clientele encompassing billionaires and welfare recipients, Fortune 500 companies and mom-and-pop businesses.  I represented those clients, applying logic and reason in the process, in a wide variety of civil, criminal, domestic, juvenile, probate, administrative, tax, and bankruptcy matters on both a fee-generating and pro bono basis.  While my law practice was varied, I focused on complex commercial litigation, requiring me in jury trials -- some lasting many weeks -- to convey detailed concepts in straightforward ways while still respecting the jurors&#39; intelligence.  (As matters ended up, I used similar skills in my classroom teaching difficult concepts to my students.)  And when I practiced law, Martindale-Hubbell compiled my fellow lawyers&#39; views of my analytical skills by awarding me a rating of &quot;av,&quot; the highest rating given.    

You have better things to do than read some of my trial and appellate filings, though they would serve as ample evidence of my analytical skills.  But at least one piece of my writing is still publicly available (I think), namely the chapter on Colorado Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1 (involving derivative actions, a fairly sophisticated topic) in Colorado Civil Procedure Forms and Commentary (D. Knapp, ed.).  

Some might think that my need to apply logic and reason to a problem would lessen as I transitioned to teaching, a key period in my life described in my personal statement accompanying this application, but that wasn&#39;t so.  I created a large number of lesson plans that sought to reach students on many levels, visual as well as auditory, kinetic as well as contemplative.  And I created course binders for my students ranging in length from 600 to 800 pages in three of the subjects I taught (AP U.S. Government &amp; Politics, AP Comparative Government &amp; Politics, and AP Human Geography) that contained all of the notes, articles, activities, organizers, vocabulary, and review materials used over the course of a year of teaching, and then -- after updating those materials yearly -- freely shared them with my teaching colleagues, as my former teaching colleague Terri Bramhall notes in her accompanying letter of recommendation.

In fact, I would make the case that interacting with teenagers on a sustained basis -- trying to motivate them while they struggle with their emotions, their intellect, their friends, their family lives, their self-image, their emerging sexuality, their hormones -- demanded a greater number of analytical skills, more logic and reason, than I ever needed as an attorney.
