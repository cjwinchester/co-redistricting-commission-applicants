<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Personal Statement Julianne Ward, Durango.    
My husband and I moved to Colorado 20 years ago from Iowa where we had lived all our lives. Being able to move to Colorado was a dream come true. Finding Durango, was not what we anticipated, but it was just right for us.
But what we did not expect, was that our nightly television news would come from New Mexico, and that we would come to know more initially about Albuquerque than we would about Denver; more about New Mexico politics than we would about Colorado’s; and more about the government and the governor of New Mexico than we would about our newly adopted state’s. Especially in Election years it’s easy to feel overlooked and disconnected if you live in La Plata County. Over time, however, we’ve come to appreciate New Mexico, but we’ve had to make effort to know and find out about Colorado and what’s happening here, how things work here, and who our elected officials are. As a consequence, I think we have paid more attention and gotten more involved than we ever were previously.
We have always enjoyed getting out and exploring, and I think there may be a county in Colorado that we have not been in, but I’d have to look carefully to find it.
I think I am aware of the diversity of our very large state, and I am familiar with not only the geography of it’s various parts, but of the people and how they live and make their livelihoods; not only the Western Slope (which was a new concept and distinction to me), but the Front Range and Eastern Plains as well. I’ve acquainted myself with all parts of the state, maybe even more so than a native might, because we were transplants who wanted to be here, and to participate in this great state.
Being sure that each and every person is fairly represented is not an easy goal to attain, but I believe that it should done with as much fairness and convenience as possible, and I would pledge to do to the best of my ability, and be honored to be involved in the endeavor.
Thank you.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am professionally trained as a social worker.  Working with people in difficult circumstance or situations is what we do, no matter who or what.  I also served as a mediator in the criminal justice system bringing victims and perpetrators together for resolution and restitution.  I think I could work with fellow commissioners to find consensus or agreement.
I have no allegiances or affiliations that would lead me to be unfair or partial.  Fair representation and reasonable convenience for that representation is what this should be about.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Again, social workers are problem solvers, working with the resources that are available.  Everybody does not usually get all of what they want, but everyone should get what they need and some of what they were wanting. I am good with math and spatial thinking and design and maps.
