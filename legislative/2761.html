<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been involved as a volunteer with the Douglas County Republican Party since 2002. I have been a District Captain, Asst District Captain, and Precinct Committee Leader. I have donated to the DCGOP, the Colorado GOP and the National Republican Party. I have donated money to several campaigns:  (1) George Brauchler for District Attorney; (2) George Brauchler for Governor/Colo Atty General; (3) Clint Dorris for DC County Commissioner; (4) Jim Smallwood for SD4; (5) Kim Ransom for HD 44; (6) &quot;Keep Our Schools Safe&quot; Issues Committee; (7) John Kellner for JD18 DA.  In November of 2019, I was a candidate for the Board of Education for the Douglas County School District. I have been a volunteer on several political campaigns, but probably my largest amount of time/energy was spend on George Brauchler&#39;s campaigns. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
(1) Douglas County Board of County Commissioner appointed me to a Physical School Security Committee in July of 2019 after the Highlands Ranch STEM school shooting; (2) I am currently the Chair of the Public Safety Advisory Committee to the Douglas County Sheriff&#39;s Office; (3) Volunteer to Douglas County Republican Party - including member of By-Laws Committee; (4) Former Chair of the Republican Central Committee for the 18th Judicial District.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
(1) In August of 2020, I organized a public forum for all GOP candidates for the Parker Town Council - assuring all candidates had access to the GOP precinct committee leaders; (2) In 2020, as the Chair of the Public Safety Advisory Committee to the Douglas County Sheriff&#39;s Office, I organized the only forum for both the Republican and Democrat candidates for the two open seats to the Douglas County Board of County Commissioners. With COVID19 restrictions, we conducted a virtual interview of the candidates and posted the  recorded video online for access by Douglas County Voters. We attempted the same for the two candidates for the Office of the District Attorney for JD18. (3) As the Chair of the 18th JD GOP Central Committee, In initiated and organized a complete re-write of the committee&#39;s by-laws by working with 4 county GOP Chairs.  I have worked with my local state assembly representatives in drafting and advocating several legislative bills. I was appointed by the Colorado Supreme Court&#39;s Rule Committee to a subcommittee on Prosecutorial Ethics, looking at the issue of pre-trial public statements by prosecutors. I have worked as a volunteer for different Home Owner Associations. I co-chaired several subcommittees for the Public Safety Advisory Committee to the Douglas County Sheriff&#39;s Office, holding public hearings on both School Safety and on the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) (a.k.a. &quot;drones&quot;) by the Sheriff&#39;s Office. I drafted and edited a 68-page report on UAVs for the Sheriff and the Board of County Commissioners, resulting in the implementation of a drone program, with recommendations for policy guidelines in light of recommendations from the ACLU. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I remember in 2002/03 there was an attempt to split a part of Douglas County into a legislative district in Jefferson County to help keep it in GOP hands. I opposed this effort, because the idea ignored the fact that Douglas County was a clearly separate community, and I advocated the DCGOP to formally oppose that idea, helping to draft the written response.  I think legislative districts should be drawn with great respect for the social/political communities that have naturally developed in the past.  The great amount of population growth in Douglas County, for example, may result in the need to draw new house and senate districts here, and I am concerned that such efforts may cause harm in disenfranchising some citizens who live in one social/political community but pulled out to be joined with other different communities into a legislative district for a statistical purpose without due regard of the impact upon these unique communities.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
By focusing on the issues/areas where we can all agree - the basic underlying philosophies contained in our Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution, and our American history, I would appeal to their sense of American patriotism. I would tell the other commissioners of my personal experience as a 19-year old U.S. Army soldier stationed in West Berlin, Germany in 1981, when I regularly crossed through Checkpoint Charlie into the Soviet Sector of occupied East Berlin. I spoke enough German to converse with many Berliners, and I learned what it was like for these humans to live in a society where their right to vote did not exist, where they did not have freedom, where their voice was not only not heard - but violently suppressed. I would appeal to the other commissioners to raise above the small narrow divisions and seek a larger picture of fairness and balance to promote our fundamental American principles that led to our democratic republic - the most unique and successful experiment in human history.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As an attorney, I have spent the last 30 years developing such skills and talents. As a prosecutor, I have had to present witness&#39;s testimony before juries and apply logic and common sense to the reality of the objective evidence, and persuade juries to agree with my analysis of those facts.  I have worked with pro se defendants and legal defense counsel to seek possible avenues of resolution of cases in the pursuit of justice, helping them to see the advantages of settlement in a manner they understood was fair and just. I&#39;ve had several cases appealed to higher courts for judicial review, and I have enjoyed a 100% rate of affirmation on appeal. Solving problems using logic and reason, analyzing the facts and applying the law, is what I do. I am very good at doing just this.  I work very hard to achieve justice in a fair and transparent manner.
