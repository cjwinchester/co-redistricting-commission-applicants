<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I worked as a full-time lobbyist between 2001-2008. I was also registered to lobby between 2008-2014 as an executive director of a statewide membership organization. I volunteered on candidate campaigns for candidates from both major parties running for the state legislature between 2002-2008 (Abel Tapia for State Senate, Brandon Shaffer for State Senate, Mark Cloer for State House). I also volunteered on ballot measure campaigns between 2002-2014 (Amendment 39 and Amendment 66). Since 2015, I have donated to one candidate campaign - Joe Salazar for Secretary of State). 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
University of Northern Colorado Board of Trustees, Latin American Educational Foundation Board of Directors (President), South Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors, Latino Leadership Institute community service days 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I worked in advocacy positions at the Colorado Education Association for 14 years, the largest union in Colorado and an organization representing over 38,000 educators in Colorado&#39;s public schools. In this role, I lobbied for the interests of public school educators and their students at the state legislature, State Board of Education, and in Colorado school districts. I also served as a Trustee for the University of Northern Colorado and was able to help implement new and revised policies that helped students, with an emphasis on students from diverse backgrounds. Currently, I am the Board President for the Latin American Educational Foundation, which is the oldest scholarship organization in Colorado serving ethic minority students. In this volunteer role, I lead the board&#39;s work in raising money for scholarships for low-income students, providing mentor services, and community engagement. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Going back to my days as a student, I have always had a strong interest in public policy. My undergraduate degree in political science focused on American government. I was fortunate to continue learning in this area as a non-partisan staff member at the Colorado Office of Legislative Council in my first job out of college. I was then able to work directly with the legislature in various professional capacities for the first decades of my career. This inclusion in the legislative process and with lawmakers gave me an appreciation for constituent relationships and advocacy. As my career progressed, I began to take an active role in volunteer public service. I remain committed to serving the community in various roles. As a first-generation college graduate, I volunteer time to help the growing Latino community in Colorado increase educational attainment and become more workforce ready. I remember that my college opportunity was made possible through the help of others. I am particularly passionate about ensuring that communities, especially underrepresented populations, have a voice in public policy that will directly impact their lives. The commission is an opportunity to craft a plan for the next decade that ensures the changing demographics, and associated community interests and needs, are represented to the best extent possible at the state legislature. I am not applying for the legislative redistricting commission for myself. In fact, I believe my service will be a challenge when it relates to my career. However, I believe my background and experience would add value to this important process that will impact so many lives. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am applying for the commission as an unaffiliated voter. I have no allegiance to either major political party. My only allegiance is to the voters who adopted the laws creating the commission. My intent is to listen carefully to the interests of communities and create maps that allow for competitive legislative races and elected officials who will serve as extensions of their constituents, regardless of party affiliation. I liken this process to a company-wide reorganization that I led in a prior job. In that situation, I met individually with every employee in the company to gather their input and feedback about current operations and ideas for future success. The data gathered was utilized to implement a restructuring plan. Most of the employees supported the reorganization because it included their ideas. Redistricting is similar in that the final plans will include the extensive citizen feedback that will be gathered by the commission. I will work with fellow commissioners to honor the data and protect the integrity of the process. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have worked in various jobs or served on boards that require building consensus and compromise. As a result, I am a skilled listener and I appreciate the value of qualitative and quantitative data.  I believe that people can develop a collaborative plan when the goal is not simply to win, but instead to find a path forward. As a collective bargainer, I learned how to utilize an interest-based approach to problem solving. This approach requires listening carefully for what others need in order to feel comfortable moving ahead. Acknowledgement to others that their needs and interests are heard is important and will often times result in creating common ground that makes moving forward easier. As the Executive Director at the Colorado Education Association, I championed the expansion of interest-based bargaining training across the state between school districts and local unions. There were many success stories of collective bargaining agreements only taking a few days to settle that had taken months of bitter negotiations in prior years.
