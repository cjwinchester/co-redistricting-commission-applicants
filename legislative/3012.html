        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Edward Fickes</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Edward Fickes
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Ted Fickes</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am the owner and principal of Bright+3, a consulting firm that communications, digital and membership services to nonprofit organizations. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a Masters of Public Affairs from the LBJ School at the University of Texas at Austin. Prior to that I received bachelors degrees in history and political science from Northwestern University. I also took coursework in computer science at DePaul University. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80238
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have worked as a volunteer organizer on several campaigns since (and including) the 1996 US Senate race in Colorado. A lot of door knocking and phone banking. I also provided paid data and website services to some state and local campaigns, mostly between 2002 and 2008, including Cary Kennedy and Ken Gordon. In the past five years I have donated to Cary Kennedy, Andrew Romanoff, Bernie Sanders, Beto O&#39;Rourke, Elizabeth Warren, Rachel Zenzinger and Sunrise PAC. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have been a member, donor and/or active supporter of work done by Sierra Club, Amnesty International, Blue Bench and Urban Peak. I have also been involved in local, county and state Democratic caucuses, including being a delegate at county and state conventions in 2018. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have provided communications and digital strategy support to a few community advocacy groups in Colorado. These include The Wilderness Society, Sierra Club and Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
It is important that access to political representation be available to every resident of Colorado. For most Coloradans, this happens at the ballot box and through the day to day work of their elected officials. With access, people are more likely to make informed choices, engage in the political process, and trust the work of their leaders.

I can offer expertise and insights that inform communities, legislators and others participating in the redistricting process. 

This is also an opportunity to meet, work with and support the long-term success of people in Colorado. I grew up here, mostly in Greeley, and have spent the majority of my adult life in Colorado. I’ve watched it evolve, recreated across the state and raised a family here. This is a diverse state and I’m anxious to help people across Colorado become and remain engaged in the democratic process. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Much of my consulting work involves building consensus among diverse client interests, both individuals and teams. Often people and organizations say they want one thing but find out, along the way, that they have other needs or haven’t fully surfaced values and goals. Anyway, my approach to consensus building involves understanding the background and needs of people through deep listening, asking questions and patience.  

With respect to redistricting commissions it seems important to recognize that our role is help inform, listen to and learn from people who aren’t in the room - the commission itself and public meetings. The ability to work on a commission reflects privilege - the ability to take time away from work and family - that most Coloradans don’t have. The ability to engage in hearings and other information gatherings reflects some level of privilege as well. We should seek to build consensus by recognizing who isn’t in the room, whose voice isn’t being heard, and be proactive about inviting them in and making the redistricting process possible for them. 

I’ll add that I don’t believe consensus means finding the only solution everyone in the room agrees upon. Consensus isn’t agreement - it’s people having a shared purpose and knowing that they were treated fairly during a process. People need to feel they had opportunity to engage, make their voice heard and were valued. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My consulting and volunteer work with campaigns and advocacy projects has utilized programming and database experience. I’ve been in the guts of voter files and census block data as well as other marketing data. I’m not a full-time data and stats person but I can work with data, sort through trends and results and am very comfortable asking questions about data. 

I’ve also created and worked with a range of problem solving and research  frameworks. I’m thinking of things like mind maps, mood boards and user experience testing.
