<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
For 19 years, I managed a staff of seven to 12 scientists at the Water Quality Control Division at the Colo. Dept of Public Health and Environment.  The Unit is the primary technical resource for the Water Quality Control Commission for all standards actions, for both surface water and ground water.  I participated regularly in the Commission’s monthly meetings, giving updates on projects that are underway, and participate in the planning and scheduling of hearings and workshops.  I managed the Division’s involvement in water quality standards rulemaking proceedings (Regulations #31-38, #41, #42 and Control Regulations), and Administrative Action Hearings (WQCC Policies 96-2, 98-1, 06-1, 10-1, and 13-1).  

The Division uses a model of proposal development that it calls Stakeholder Involvement.  Our approach was to convene interested stakeholders early in the process to gather information and understand their perspective to develop regulatory and policy proposals in an open and transparent way.  In those 19 years as Unit Manager I managed many stakeholder processes, from cajoling reluctant participants, managing unruly discussions, providing endless re-caps of the progress for newly engaged stakeholder, and translating between the attorneys in the room, the scientists and the environmental advocates.   It was often messy, sometime contentious and generally productive.

The “Communities of Interest” in water quality standards probably at least partially overlap those that are interested in redistricting.  The rural community interests are distinct from the urban areas.  I have extensive experience with both.  I have worked on water quality issues with the unincorporated communities and Sanitation Districts (such as Vista Verde Mobile Home Park and Durango West Metro District 2) small towns (such as Kit Carson and Creede) all the way to Denver Water and the Metro Wastewater Reclamation District.  I have proven experience managing stakeholder groups that include both water quantity interests from both sides of the Continental Divide and that confront the competing interests of dischargers and water users.

Once the Stakeholder Process ended for an issue, my Unit took the information, perspectives and limitations presented by the Stakeholders and developed a rulemaking or policy proposal for consideration by the Water Quality Control Commission.  My role then changed to that of advocate.  Providing evidence and rationale for adoption, defending the proposal and testifying in hearings.

The major stakeholder processes that I managed include developing the process for assigning Recreational Use Criteria, Sediment Criteria, Biological Criteria, Temperature Criteria, Nutrient Criteria, and Discharger Specific Variances.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
•	I care deeply about governance – how government works to serve the governed.  In my years as a state employee, I served through several administrations – Republican and Democrat.  When I worked on high profile initiatives, I represented the Division at the Capitol, meeting with Legislators and staff.   I am convinced that we can do better.   One way to do better is to make sure that we have districts that make sense so that individual legislators are more clearly linked to rational districts.
•	I love maps and especially when maps show the intersection of layers of information. 
•	I have the time and energy to serve Colorado in this way that seems like a perfect fit for my skills and experience.
•	This seems like a perfect stakeholder process!  There is an experienced staff, a clear mandate, a necessary tangible product, significant public interest, and a due date.   Most importantly, a due date!  

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have an ability to listen to people and hear the kernel of their argument.  I grew up in rural Wyoming and rural California and didn’t move to an urban center until I was in my thirties.  I know what it means to try and communicate with bureaucrats that seem to speak a different language.  I also know what it means to BE that bureaucrat with a specific charge and well-honed vocabulary specific to my niche of government.  Once there is a common understanding of what people are saying, then, progress can be made on finding potential solutions that meet the charge of the group.

The charge for the commission is so clear that it supports the fairness and impartiality of commission members.  I have proven experience working to implement the intent of the Water Quality Control Act, regardless of my personal views about environmental protection.  While I am a registered Democrat, I am not a partisan fanatic.  I know that I can help the commission meet the intent of the charge.  

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have reasonable computer skills (Excel, MS Word, various databases).  I used ESRI products in my position as Standards Unit Manager, although the heavy GIS lifting was done by members of my staff.  I also am comfortable with (and not frightened of) statistics.
At heart, I am a scientist, and bring logic and reason to the assessment of data.  I have about 20 years of experience developing draft criteria, comparing data to those draft criteria and assessing the results.   And then starting over; I have a great deal of experience with starting over.
