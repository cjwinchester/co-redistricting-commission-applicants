<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have voted in every election I have been eligible for since I was 18 years old. I have never donated money to any political party, campaign, activist group, or lobbyist organization. I do not feel that any one campaign, political party, view, or platform represents my personal political ideology or morals and therefore I do not plan to join a political party, ever.  I do not believe that republicans, democrats, or any other political party can or ever will fully represent the interests of any individual citizen or more importantly, the greater interests of our collective population, states, or country. I believe in people, not parties.

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
In 2018, after returning from my Fulbright research project in Serbia, where I researched urban solutions for refugee housing, I began volunteering with the East Colfax Youth Center in Aurora. I enjoy helping the youth there, who are primarily refugees, or children of refugees. We help them navigate homework, the English language, and sometimes just play games or talk about how to adjust to life in the US. People who are resettled in the US arrive here at a disadvantage trying to navigate American culture, the English language, and sometimes, simple everyday tasks which we take for granted. I believe that even a small amount of help can go a long way to make a difference in someone&#39;s life. Help and compassion can alleviate other stress, anxiety and past trauma. 

With the Village Institute, I was able to combine my passion for assisting with refugee aid/resettlement with my expertise in architecture. I have become a part-time volunteer consultant to this new organization for planning and architectural purposes. I served on their initial advisory board for 6 months and continue to be involved with helping them in various capacities related to the field of architecture and design. 

I am a strong advocate of affordable housing and have made an effort to work on projects and expose myself to that sector of the building industry. I have also had the opportunity to work on several affordable housing projects in Colorado and Wyoming. 

When a public issue is important to me, or I have extra time to do so, I attend public meetings for local neighborhood design boards within Denver, and city council sessions. I also enjoy attending the informational sessions hosted by the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I strongly believe in the eradication of gerrymandering in Colorado, and throughout the country. It is imperative that no single political party ever gains power through unfair redistricting processes. Congressional and legislative districts should be determined by population and represent the populations who live within them, because the elected representatives exist to serve people, not political factions. I want to serve on this commission because I will add a fair and just voice; an advocate for a district map which will promote the most inclusive cross-section of our state&#39;s demographics. 

My experience in architecture and urban planning provides me with an appropriate skillset to make substantial contributions to this commission and resulting map. The process of designing a building requires drawings, but the drawings are merely the final result of a long, iterative problem solving process. Throughout this process, I regularly participate in discussions with various agencies and contributors for each project, including the clients, developers, politicians, engineers, neighbors, utilities, and design review boards.  For any project in any given jurisdiction, it is my job to gather and organize information from each of these entities, then apply it to the most appropriate and effective piece of architecture. Only then, is it possible to design a successful piece of architecture. If selected to the commission, I will apply a similar approach to the design of the new map. I enjoy this collaborative problem solving process and would have fun serving on the commission.  Even if I am not selected as a member of the commission, I strongly believe that at least one person with an architecture and/or urban planning background should serve on the commission. 

Prior to, and while serving on the commission, I will educate myself about the redistricting commissions of other states who have developed similar, non-partisan, socially and economically just commissions. (mainly California and Arizona) We may not have the ability to directly impact the voting practices of other states, but I believe that implementing a just process for redistricting within Colorado, can and should become a model for other states to rectify socially unjust redistricting processes. Not only would I be proud to participate in establishing fair representation for Colorado, but the possibility of affecting positive change in other states too. 

I have zero political aspirations of my own, but would be proud to participate on the commission in order to serve the state in which I live, even just for a brief period of time. The opportunity to serve on this commission is exciting because I would learn more about the process of redistricting, the demographics of Colorado, and how the legislative branch of our government operates. I will look forward to traveling to various parts of Colorado and hearing from local citizens, learning more about the places they call home, their varied politics, and do my best to take all comments into consideration while serving on the commission and developing a new map. I would consider it a fun and educational privilege. 





</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
One of the main reasons that I want to be a part of this commission is to establish a district map which is fair and impartial to political factions, race, economic status, sex, religion, and age.  From my work in the architectural field, I have a lot of experience working in teams and have the ability to adapt to various personalities, of all demographics. I care about being inclusive of all ideas and listening to all views prior to making decisions as a team. I believe that promoting diversity of people and ideas is crucial to the best outcome for any project. In architecture, individualism loses. It is imperative to work as a team player and be open to compromising in order to achieve a common goal. 

I believe that relying on facts and data will be crucial to creating agreement and consensus among the commissioners. People must set aside their ideologies in order to make the commission work well. As a lifelong unaffiliated voter, I believe that I will be in a good position to promote consensus. In the event of disagreement, I am confident and capable of speaking up to promote civil solutions. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I studied architecture at two very different universities; one technical school in Detroit and another fine arts school in Providence. The architectural pedagogy of the two universities couldn&#39;t differ more, but regardless of the theoretical approach to design and whether or not a project is built or merely conceptual, logic and reason are ingrained in all successful architecture. Without logic and reason, architecture cannot function well or properly serve the future users/inhabitants. They are inherent qualities of the work that I do on a daily basis. 

I have the ability and extensive experience in problem solving at a variety of scales, while working with a diverse set of agencies and individuals. In order to successfully complete an architectural project, one must gather data on the site, climate, local demographics, available materials, budgets, future users, and analyze it during the design process; all while pleasing the client who is paying for it. To do this efficiently and effectively, I have become skilled at distilling the relevant information very early on in each project. 

Decisions are often made by politicians for purely political or personal reasons. This will likely never change, but what can change, is eliminating the politics from Colorado&#39;s district map. Logic and reason must be applied in order to develop a new map.
