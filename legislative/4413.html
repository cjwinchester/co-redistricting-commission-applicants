        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Brendan Sheerin</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Brendan Sheerin
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am recently retired, and i seek to be of service.  My forty year career was as a teacher, and then Head of School (s) in independent (prep.) schools throughout the USA, although 26 years was spent at one school in the Washington DC area.  I was born in Ireland, married my wife in 1985, and became a citizen in the early 1990s.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  My academic degrees, undergraduate (BA Honors) and graduate (MA)come from The Queen&#39;s University, of Belfast, Ireland. Over the years, I have taken various courses from  grant classes at Notre Dame to Leadership Fairfax in Virginia, and created a Leadership Richmond class for potential school leaders at the University of Richmond, Virginia.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81004
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
While I was working, I did not engage at the level of activism at any level: working on behalf of a candidate, posting, flyers, providing financial contributions, etc.  I viewed my political leaning as personal and private.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I came to Colorado in June, 2015, and other than helping a friend in his ill-fated run for mayor of Pueblo as an Independent  ( he did not get enough names to make the ballot), I have not been involved in political life.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Again, i have not been involved in Colorado, but over the years I have served in both professional and civic organizations. For five years in the mid-1990s, I was the voluntary director of the Virginia Association of independent Schools&#39; professional development committee, organizing a yearly conference for 1200 members.  I also served in MIchigan on a similar committee.  In Virginia, I was Treasurer of the Loudoun County Foster and Adoptive Parents Association for many years, and this organization was my major civic engagement.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
There is a wonderful phrase that I was introduced to years ago, and that has stuck with me since: &quot; A generosity of spirit.&quot;  this country has provided me with a wonderful life and career, and I am very proud to be an American citizen.  I believe it is important to give back, and I believe that now, in retirement, I have been provided with the time to give back to my country, and specifically, to the State of Colorado.
Democracy is not something that we can take for granted, and the creation of this commission says much about Colorado&#39;s willingness to take the lead in protecting democracy for the future.
I grew up in Ireland during &quot;The Troubles&quot;, caused in part by gerrymandering and discrimination, and I understand just how important a fair and equal system for election is.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
It really does not matter whether it is a school, a company, or a commission, the key to success in any organization is trust.  Only when trust has been firmly established can any group move onto those critical, hard conversations that need to happen.  These conversations often involve conflict, and that is both to be expected and encouraged, for with trust in place, conversations can eventually move to a place of consensus.  It is not a fast process, but it can be achieved.  It is a process that can be easily pushed of the rails by an individual, and that is why selection process for the commission members is so important.  There is an author called Lencioni. and he wrote a book called &quot;The Five Dysfunctions of a Team&quot; that is popular and that might be a great read for all commission members before they start their work.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Being a Head of School in the private sector is like being the CEO of a small (some large) company.  You are responsible for all aspects of the school from governance to budget, to admissions, to future thinking and planning, from fund raising to creating product.  Of greatest importance are two items: ensuring that all your efforts are mission-driven, and that you do not drift from that. and in ensuring the success and growth of your colleagues that are, also, your employees. To be successful, the leader must examine almost all aspects of the school in a logical, organized manner, and leave emotions to one side.
