<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I am a long time environmental advocate.  Now that I am retired I have time to become personally engaged by working on issues important to me.  I bring my skills that include close to 40 years in management to this work. I am able to bring strategic decision making, collaboration, planning and financial ability to the organizations I work with.
Building support for sustainability throughout our community is vital to the work that Sustainable Resilient Longmont (SRL) undertakes. SRL engages residents across the community, including  youth and people of color in events such as earth day.  SRL Earth day is a focus on children and how they interact with the earth.  In 2020, the event moved on line with youth from local high schools discussing what climate change means in their lives. 
Another important aspect in community/ grassroots activism is working with city government.  I know all of the city council members personally.  I frequently speak at council meetings to advocate for environmental issues.  This relationship was a key element in achieving a Longmont Resolution to commit to 100% renewable energy by 2030.

</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Being involved in our democracy is important to me.  My involvement includes donations to candidates at all levels of our government, working with organizations to promote candidates, and personal engagement such as door to door campaigning. 
Locally I work with a grassroots group that delivers candidate information to residents in Longmont.  Through my local Sierra Club group in Boulder County, I work on candidate endorsements based on environmental priorities.  Also, I am on the board of Sustainable Resilient Longmont.  This organization holds candidate forums where candidates are asked questions about sustainability. 

This election season, I determined that I needed to engage in the Presidential Election.  I wrote letters, texted and made phone calls to battleground states through  Sierra Club Independent Action.  

Donations: Federal: Clinton, Inslee, Buttigeig, Warren, Biden, Romanoff

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have a growing awareness of the divisines in our politics.  There are many who donâ€™t feel heard when they raise concerns.  Where I live, in Longmont, I know that the chances of electing a person to the Federal House of Representatives who reflects my community are almost nil.  
It is crucial that our political landscape become more about representing people and the local/ regional aspects of the communities where we live. My hope is that by serving on the committee, I can advocate for a fair map where everyone can know that their voice will be heard when voting.  A map that realizes the dream of equal representation, without favoring parties or special interests, while also acknowledges areas of our communities have special circumstances, such as
race and economic status that must be reflected in the maps. I continue to hope for a return to civility in politics where we listen to and learn from each other.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As I look at the current political landscape, I see so much division. I grew up in rural Nebraska.  I know and love many folks who are conservative.  I am not afraid to reach out to those who do not share my political views.  In my work in Nursing Administration, being able to build relationships with people in other divisions was paramount to the success in my area of responsibility.  Also, working on projects that involved caregivers on several shifts, in several units on two campuses,  required skills in building consensus.  To bring in physician acceptance required negotiating skills.  I use these skills of negotiating, relationship and consensus building, plus willingness to work with people of diverse backgrounds to my activism work.  I also bring the nursing art and skill of empathy.  Stepping back to see the people behind decisions and how they are affected is needed in any work.
My work with SRL provides an example of how I can apply these skills. Acceptance of the possibility of renewable energy is difficult for many people.  Acknowledging that jobs in the fossil fuel industry will be lost, then discussing the potential of jobs in renewable energy requires listening first instead of arguing. This usually leads to a good conversation while planting seeds that may change minds.  

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My success in Nursing Administration was based on my ability to analyze issues and apply data to arrive at a solution. I will relate a quality improvement project in my last position.  There were three ICUâ€™s.  A QI project to reduce ventilator associated pneumonia was very successful in 2 of the 3.  The third, the Neuro Trauma ICU, was difficult, but knowing that there had to be a reason, a team explored the differences.  We discovered that patients who had head trauma were being transported daily for head CT scans.  The transport was putting them at risk and we were able to define some simple steps to prevent this complication.  
I apply the same type of skills to my activist work. When planning educational events about topics, such as renewable energy, exploring data and research studies informs how we plan events. Reading through online records of meetings and attending board meetings at Platte River Power Authority gives me the ability to discuss electricity generation with our city council and to speak with other community members.
