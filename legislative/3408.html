</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As the neighborhood ambassador for Wildfire Adapted Partnership my responsibilities include communicating with the neighborhood I represent and the Wildfire Adapted Staff the progress and efforts of fire mitigation that individual landowners and community shared areas have taken to insure Wildfires do not claim lives and do not destroy homes.  I host annual meetings with the neighborhood and Wildfire adapted to cover issues such as fire bans, fire mitigation efforts, drought conditions, defensible space, etc.  I also attend online meetings with other ambassadors and Wildfire Adapted Staff.
I served on the Montezuma School to Farm Advisory Committee where I was an advisor to the executive director of the program.  I helped advise on various topics from fundraising to event planning, school garden planning, and interaction with students in the classroom.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am concerned about Gerrymandering in the State of Colorado and want to ensure that all citizens are represented fairly in their vote and representation by the redistricting commissions.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
By looking at the overall issues with the current district maps I believe I have the ability to help the commissioners come to a consensus by addressing inequalities and problems that both sides are encountering and work towards a solution that appeases both sides and promotes fairness to the public at large.   I have a great ability to be fair or impartial to all areas of my life.  I attribute this to my ability to look at any scenario through multiple lenses.  I can see how my actions in the past have impacted others or inflicted responses from them based on how they felt they were being treated.  Many a conflict I have helped resolved not only between friends who could not see the other friends viewpoint but also in patient care over the last 13 years.  The ability to give hope to those who had given up on life due to their health conditions.  To help those patients see that there are other options and to give them a try instead of giving up.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In addition to a Chiropractic degree I hold a special post-doctoral study in the upper cervical spine.  In this study I must have a very detailed eye to perceive the slightest degree of misalignment that may be keeping a patient from getting well.  From marking a detailed x-ray to reading thermographic scans of a patients brain stem function in order to make a determination on when and how to make a correction to the upper cervical spine and then examine if said correction was effective by looking at the factors again after the treatment was administered.  Many cases require logic and reasoning skills far beyond average.  To be able to gather information from the patient that was not previously recorded or perhaps ignored in the patients previous history.  Then to be able to make a connection to why the persons lifestyle or past experiences may have contributed to their current state of health both mentally and physically.  I am a master at connecting the dots for people.
