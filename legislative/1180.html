<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I have been active in the Boulder community since returning to Colorado in 1988, after serving in the US Navy.  In each of my professional positions, I was responsible for organizing, representing, advocating for, and considering the interests of communities. I worked in the public sector for nearly 30 years, and then for the nonprofit organization, &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; Foundation of Boulder County for 10 years, where my work contributed toward ending the cycle of poverty through education and youth/family empowerment.  I have been a liaison and partner with numerous organizations throughout Boulder County and sometimes with state and federal partners. I have helped support youth participation in and organization of community events, and participated in city and school district task forces.  The following are a few examples.  
 
At the University of Colorado, I implemented a new program to promote graduate level work by students underrepresented at the graduate level, and coordinated the efforts of faculty committees in grant awards for their peers.  For the city of Boulder, I provided the staff leadership for a task force of members of the development community advising the city on a new development review and structure of fees for services.  For BVSD, I organized activities and advocated for students with special needs, and for &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; I was able to practice all these skills as I coordinated with more than 100 community partners to match resources with children and families.  In addition, I served on a preschool advisory board, many parent committees, and have volunteered to promote and celebrate diversity.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have participated in civic engagement activities, and a few political party sponsored events, throughout my life, but not extensively.  For the last few years, I have participated in organized politics via the Forever Indivisible group in Boulder.  I have donated to political campaigns to elect Joe Neguse, Andrew Romanoff, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and a few other candidates.  I also contribute to the efforts of the ACLU, and the Sierra Club.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
&quot;I Have a Dream&quot; Foundation of Boulder County, Dream Big Task Force, Casa de Paz Colorado, City of Boulder task force to consider redevelopment of Washington Elementary School site, BVSD committee for renovation of Casey Middle School, and Boulderâ€™s Community Foundation.  More recently, I participated in the Forever Indivisible community action group to learn about local and national issues, hear directly from representatives/candidates, and take action in my areas of interest.  I am both a volunteer and a sponsor (financial contributor) for the &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; Foundation of Boulder County, and a contributor and volunteer with Casa de Paz -  assisting newly released detainees, from the ICE center in Aurora, reunite with their families.  The Dream Big Task Force was a collective effort among government and nonprofit agencies to explore opportunities to provide educational and mentoring resources to more of the students living in poverty in Boulder County.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am interested in the exercise of redistricting because I am passionate about preserving our election system and ensuring a government by and for all the people.  I think this commission would provide a fascinating opportunity to learn more about the districts in Colorado, and the process of mapping those districts. I also know this would be a very rewarding experience to know that I contributed to a worthy effort.   I would be gratified to participate in ensuring that the criteria for drawing the legislative district maps for the state of Colorado were met;  making sure these maps accurately and fairly represent the communities that exist.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have extensive experience, both professional and personal, in team-building and promoting consensus.  In fact, I am sure that the best outcomes can only result from creating agreement from diverse perspectives.  I also am a person who actually likes meetings and the process of building consensus as we learn from one another. I will promote consensus and agreement because that is the only way to create and maintain systems that protect our democracy.  I see the commission as an opportunity to participate in the continuous improvement of our democracy and efforts to build impartial and fair representation for everyone in Colorado.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My education and professional experience were in these exact areas.  I practiced research and analytical skills in school and early in my career.  I was an analyst for the city of Boulder where I lead projects to improve systems within the city&#39;s operations.  Throughout my career, I worked to build consensus and to draw upon the strengths and expertise of all involved, recognizing that the best outcomes are always the result of teamwork, respect, and diversity. Again, my entire career was spent analyzing systems, designing and managing projects, and providing leadership that ensured the meaningful participation of all stakeholders.
