        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for John Kim</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  John Kim
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a self employed with businesses in farming, ranching and real estate investment/development.  I am also retired from the private law practice.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have B.A. in economics and English. I also have a J.D. and an inactive member of the Colorado Bar.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80125
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am not active in a political organization for the election of any public official. I have donated to the following: Cory Gardner, John McCain, Lora Thomas, Mike Coffman, John Kellner and other Republican candidates for office in Colorado.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Cherry Hills Community Church, Red Rocks Church, Trout Unlimited, San Luis Valley Cattleman&#39;s Association (through my business Zeppelin Land and Cattle), Colorado Bar association, California Bar association, past representative with the Colorado Center for Legal Inclusiveness and past board member of the Colorado chapter of the Entrepreneurs Organization.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I was the managing partner of my law firm, Hensley Kim, LLC. As such, I had to balance the needs of the partners, associates, staff and most importantly clients. I was also a representative member of the Colorado Center for Legal Inclusiveness as an acting managing partner of a law firm. In that capacity, I dealt with important issues related to diversity and inclusiveness in the legal profession. I was also the Director of Finance and member of the Board of the Colorado chapter of the Entrepreneurs Organization.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that a fair and robust election system is crucial for our democracy. I believe competitive races that bring out open and robust dialogue is important. This starts with integrity in our voting districts. A highly partisan, gerrymandered districting eats away at the public&#39;s confidence in our electoral system. This is why I believe in the mission of this commission. My parents immigrated to Colorado from South Korea in 1975 to come to a country that not only provided incredible economic opportunity but also to get away from a corrupt and inaccessible political power structure. I grew up with an appreciation for our democratic institutions and the importance of an active voting citizenry. I grew up in Colorado Springs, raised my family in Douglas County and have businesses in San Luis Valley, Colorado Springs, Aurora and Douglas County. Colorado is my home and I want to see my home have fair and transparent elections. I would gladly and gratefully give my time and resources to help make this happen.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that regardless of political affiliations, that I can and will engage in open dialogue with the spirit of collaboration. My experience in being a leader of my businesses and organizations has taught me the importance of hearing others before making a decision or giving my opinion. I think most of us start with common beliefs in fundamental fairness and respect. My approach in working with other commissioners would start from that point of view. I bring to the table personal experience in dealing with the concerns of rural Colorado given my background in farming and ranching. I think it is crucial to have a balance of rural and urban/suburban views on the commission, especially as our State grows.  I also have a healthy appreciation for political discourse without rancor as my brother and children are Democrats. Holiday meals are lively with earnest discourse in politics but still based on love and respect for each other regardless of political opinion.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My legal training and 14 years of practicing law has refined my analytical skills. I would apply the same process of gathering the facts and information, analyzing the issue presented and then make fair and reasonable decisions based upon logic and unbiased application of the rules.
