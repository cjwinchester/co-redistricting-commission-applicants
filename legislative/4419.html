<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Courtney E Law
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Courtney E Law</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Director of Communications, Partnerships and Digital Initiatives at the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver - 2019-current
Director of Communications and Government Affairs with the Denver Department of Finance - 2014-2018
Director of Communications with Strategies 360 - 2011-2014
Director of Communications with Colorado House Democrats - 2011

The communications positions I have held throughout my career have given me innumerable opportunities  to educate, persuade, and tell powerful stories. A prominent theme throughout my work is empowering  individuals to engage with their communities and make their voices heard in the democratic process. 

I currently work as the Director of Communications, Partnerships, and Digital Initiatives at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Denver. In this role, I manage a team of four and am responsible for all internal and external communications and public relations, developing strategic partnerships for the museum, and creating a new path forward for the museum in the digital sphere. 

Prior to my current position, I served as the Communications and Government Affairs Director for the Denver Department of Finance, where I managed the internal and external communications for a 400-person agency. My role required that I build relationships with local media, City Council members and city agency leadership, draft messaging for internal and external audiences and market the agency as a transparent resource to taxpayers. I was a core member of the 2017 general obligation bond team, which was responsible for planning the year long effort to engage and communicate with the public regarding the opportunity to invest $937 million in  city-owned infrastructure. I designed and executed the public outreach plan, which was the most robust in the city’s history. All seven ballot measures for the bond were approved by voters. 

As a commissioner, I will leverage these skills and my various professional experiences to ensure an efficient, effective, and fair redistricting process so that all Coloradans’ voices are heard.
 


</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  BA from University of Colorado Boulder in Political Science (2005) 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80207
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I’m civic-minded and very engaged with and invested in all levels of government. I have made donations to a variety of campaigns since 2015, including:
Leslie Herod for Colorado 
Steve Fenberg for Senate 
Committee to elect Barbara McLachlan 
McCann for Denver DA
Molly for County Clerk 
Brittany Petterson for Colorado 
Wendy Davis for Congress 
Gillibrand 2020 
Warren for President 
Biden/Harris 2020 

I also volunteer for state and federal candidates during elections phone banking or canvassing neighborhoods. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I currently serve on the PAC board for One Colorado, the state’s leading LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, which makes determinations about endorsements in statewide races.

I’ve served as a youth mentor at PlatteForum, a Denver-based arts nonprofit, for a summer program I developed about civics and art. I also served on the board for New Era Colorado for seven years, four of which I was the board chair. New Era Colorado engages young people in the democratic process, which includes voting and policy advocacy. 

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>

I have, for my entire adult life, both personally and professionally, sought to give a voice to the voiceless. It’s vitally important for any functioning democracy, community, or conference room to ensure that a diversity of voices and perspectives are represented and heard. Doing so ensures a fairer process and outcome. 

I am an out lesbian and have fought in various capacities to advance equal rights and justice for same-sex couples. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock appointed me to the city’s GLBT Commission. I advocated publicly for civil unions in Colorado, providing TV, print and radio interviews for outlets across the world and testifying in multiple legislative committees. And I currently serve as a member of the PAC board for ONE Colorado.  

Engaging young people in the democratic process is another example of my passion for bringing underrepresented voices to the table. I served as New Era Colorado’s Chair of the Board for four years and was on the board for a total of seven years. In that time, tens of thousands of young people were registered to vote by New Era Colorado, which also boasts a high voter turnout rate. 

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
If selected, serving on this commission would be one of the greatest honors of my life. I am passionate about this state, about fair representation in elections, and about bringing everyone into our democratic process. 

I have more than a decade of experience in both professional and personal spheres acting as a mediator among stakeholders. I have led projects, the success of which were dependent on the public engagement efforts that I organized, something I know will be key to the commission’s work. 

Building trust and authentic relationships with the people I work with, no matter the context, are central to how I operate. If selected to be on the commission, I will communicate and collaborate with all of my fellow members of the commission as well as the public.  

As a member of the commission, I would take seriously my role to ensure that communities of interest are fairly represented in the maps for the next decade in Colorado. As a woman and member of the LGBTQ+ community, I understand how it feels to be underrepresented or left out altogether. My lived experience will allow me to bring empathy and compassion to the redistricting process. 

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have no doubt that the commission will experience disagreements and impasses on occasion - possibly with some regularity. This is a complex process with myriad conflicting interests and ideals. But listening, finding common ground with fellow commissioners however I can, and remembering that the outcome of the process will determine the fate of the state I call home for the next decade will be how I seek to overcome those impasses.

The professional accomplishments I am most proud of required the most coordination and collaboration. From educating and advocating for the Affordable Care Act to organizing the public outreach and communications for the city’s general obligation bond, I am skilled at incorporating others’ ideas and turning them into quality finished products. 

Additionally, I believe I can leverage my background in strategic communications to help the commission bridge the gap between public comment and the commission’s work.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I’m a natural leader and strategic, analytical thinker who loves solving complex problems. I have developed mediation skills as a board member for different advocacy groups. And I am incredibly skilled at consensus building among my team and with various stakeholders from working in local and state government, where large bureaucracies must be navigated to achieve results.
