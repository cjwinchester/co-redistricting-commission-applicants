<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
a. Along with another fellow employee–I organized &amp; led meetings of a new employees’ organization--at Fitzsimons AMC/Dept. of Clinical Investigation (DCI) (1987-1988).  We two were responsible for (1) communicating with the employees–especially about the department head’s policy decisions and changes [A series of really sore points, at that time.] (2) communicating information about personnel policies (3) and reporting back to the chief of DCI. 

b. Currently I belong to a variety of organizations, including: Holy Cross Lutheran Church/Wheat Ridge, CO--Holy Cross-St Andrews church/La Junta, CO–Colorado Master Gardeners–Colorado State Parks Raptor Monitors–Colorado Mtn. Club/Pueblo, CO–the Danish-America museum &amp; Genealogy Center/Elk Horn, IA–History Colorado (a.k.a. Colorado Historic Society)–&amp; National Active and Retired Federal Employees (NARFE). 
I’m more active in some of these organizations than others–especially during this viral pandemic. I joined these organizations based on personal interest.  I try to use my interests &amp; talents to benefit the organizations. 
For one example: I identify, &amp; count the raptors at John Martin Reservoir State Park--every 1-2 weeks. (Raptor data–from the state parks--helps the Colorado Parks &amp; Wildlife agency to track the overall wildlife health and food chain--in each state park.)
For another example: I have a genealogy hobby. This hobby leads me into a lot of information--about Danish &amp; Slesvig/Schleswig immigrants, to the United States.  I’ve been able to give the Danish Genealogy Center a good amount of information–about my numerous ancestors--who immigrated from the 1870s to the 1920s.

c. On a personal level--when the COVID-19 pandemic hit Colorado–&amp; my area (SE Colorado): After checking my own situation–I realized I was doing better than most.  But, I knew--that too many others, in Rocky Ford &amp; Otero county--were out-of-work, out of paychecks, scared, and confused.  (There aren’t many economic opportunities or much wealth in this area.)  
I considered what I could do to help.  My “helps” so far: (1) pick up extra canned food–and deliver them, weekly-- to the local food bank in La Junta (2) pickup groceries, for my neighbor  who can’t drive, and (3) make phone calls and send cards--to friends &amp; neighbors–who were also locked in--especially those in the senior living places.  
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>

1. Never been actively involved in a political party.
 2. donated to ActBlue/Colorado Democrats--monthly
donation--2020
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
1. NARFE (National active &amp; retired federal employees} 
2. AFGE (American federation of government employees) 
3. Colorado Master Gardeners--CO State University, Ft Collins, CO 
4. Colorado Mountain Club--El Pueblo chapter 
5. History Colorado 
6. Danish American Museum and Genealogy Center--Elkhorn,IA 
7. Colorado State Parks Raptor Monitors
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
1. Provide a voice--from the less populated part of Colorado (i.e. SE corner of Colorado). 
2. Provide a voice--
from someone who has lived in the state for a fair number of years--since June 1951 (6 yrs old, almost 7). 
3. Provide a voice--from someone who has knowledge &amp; appreciation of the land, the wildlife and the growing
things in this state.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
a. As to promoting consensus: When faced with disagreeing persons–I try to find &amp; propose different points of view–or present other possible solutions.  
For example, I was placed on a Jefferson county jury in July 1998 (a child neglect case)–and somehow elected chairman of the jury.  At first, two or three, of the jurors--went on and on–“psychoanalyzing” and blaming the mother, for everything.  I realized--that line of debate would get us nowhere–because, you can’t get inside anybody else’s head.  So I suggested that we concentrate only on the actual physical evidence–i.e. what had been presented in court, and what had happened to the children.  That seemed to concentrate everyone’s thinking.  The jury was able to reached an agreement--and return to court--in a surprising amount of time. 

b. As to being fair or impartial: As an employee, I was recruited (occasionally), to go thru job applications or to join applicant interviews.  The applications &amp; interviews contained all sorts of inputs–a variety negative remarks--bad grammar &amp; spelling–”don’t care” attitudes–and political statements.  I found that I needed to “wall off” the negative &amp; extraneous inputs. Responsibilities, experience, genuine qualifications, &amp; awards are (hopefully) left. Then, I could make reasonable choices. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
a. From 1985 to 1987 and from 1988 to 1997–I worked as a personal computer troubleshooter.  I  resolved a constant stream of software, hardware and network problems–for a good number of computer users.  
With each trouble call–I had to start by finding out what was really needed or what was really going wrong.  Then, I had to apply a good deal of reasoning/logic and computer knowledge–to find a solution. And last, I needed to explain the problem (as well as possible) to the user and tell them “what to do next time”.      

b. I’ve been a volunteer Colorado Master Gardener in Otero county–from 2007 to the present.  Most of my gardening trouble calls need my on-site investigation–gardening knowledge--research–and then reasoning--to determine (1) what the gardener’s/plant’s problem is and (2) how to resolve or deal with the problem.  

c. I am a volunteer raptor monitor at John Martin Reservoir State Park (2006 to the present). (Raptors are predator birds–such as hawks, eagles, harriers, etc.).  At the state park, I first locate  raptors. Then I use my observation skills--knowledge about raptor plumage, behaviors, and migration habits–and my logic/reasoning--to determine the actual species, I’ve found.  (I report the numbers &amp; species to Colorado Parks &amp; Wildlife.  They use this data to keep track of the welfare--of the state park’s wildlife.) 
						
d. One of my hobbies is genealogy: Genealogy takes a surprising amount of logic/reasoning. For example, how do I tell, if I’ve found the same ancestor--in two (or more) different records?  I need to judge dates–locations–the spelling of names &amp; places–handwriting–handwriting, in a non-English language--other records, in a document–family stories, etc. Sometimes the records do not match up. Then I must use my reasoning–knowledge of history–and knowledge of genealogy–to make a best guess.
