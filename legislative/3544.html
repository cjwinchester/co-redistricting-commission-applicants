<h5>Occupation</h5>

</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>

  I attended Overland High School and graduated from Eaglecrest High in 2000.  After that I pursued my undergraduate degree at Metro State, but transitioned my studies and went to complete a BA of Humanities from Regis University in 2013.

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. in 2009 and have since invested time in learning the national democratic process of our republic. I do not have past political activity or have made monetary donations but this election I invested time -- I volunteered in texathons for the Biden | Harris campaign. In addition, June of this year, I organized recourses for a promotional video -- an interview with senator Leslie Herrod -- in support of bill S.B. 217, Law Enforcement Integrity and Accountability Act, before it passed earlier this year.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I do not formally belong to any organizations, but I volunteer for the Dolores Project and have done so over the last 4 years. I also support the PIBOC Alliance of Larimer County with fundraising events, as well as Violence Free Colorado. Previously, I was a part of the Junior League of Denver for 4 years as a committee advisor for new and relocating members.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My experience in organizing, representing, advocating for, in the state of Colorado is active both within and outside of my primary employer. Within my work organization at Breakthru, I dedicated the last 4 years volunteering on a self-led engagement event benefiting Violence Free Colorado and their mission to abolish relationship violence from the Colorado culture. After the first year, and due to high engagement amongst Colorado employees, the organization adopted this as their annual engagement event. Since the conception of this event, I was able to advocate for a violence free culture by organizing and introducing guest speakers, informational orientations, and leading fundraising teams that were able to fundraise $20,000 in 3 years, of which 100% was donated to Violence Free Colorado. In addition, I am the founder and operating manager of Malachite Equity Seal, a service organization that is dedicated to building equitable economies throughout Colorado by recognizing organizations that balance equity and profit with a Seal of Accountability – a public tool to mobilize our vision – guide black, indigenous women of color to places that balance equity and profit, while maintaining an inclusive and just culture. Since the conception of the organization in September of 2020, we raised $1,000 in donations for The BIPOC Alliance of Larimer County through a skill sharing workshop that was conceived, sponsored and led by Malachite Equity Seal, promoted by the alliance, hosted by local experts and attended by community participants.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I see abolishing gerrymandering as a tangible strategy to fulfill my, as well as many other’s goal(s), of abolishing inequalities in the state of Colorado that are responsible for the oppression of marginalized residents. In addition, the opportunity to inspire action amongst others in this capacity is once in a lifetime and I am excited, as well as grateful, about the opportunity to learn and apply myself even further by serving on this commission and delivering on the goals.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Since consensus decision making is a creative and dynamic way of reaching agreement in a group, and co-operation between equals is the emphasis, I believe fostering an inclusive culture where all feel safe to explore differences is a good start. I see clarity and effective communication as two critical skills that can promote consensus. Initial clarity on the commissioner’s collective mission, vision and goals will pay dividends later. Fostering broad communication skills, like actively listening for understanding, and paraphrasing so everyone goes away with a shared understanding are basics to lean on, as well as using digital communication to: recap; summaries, collect and share information; and seek ongoing clarity.  Objectivity is seeing things as they are -- I can remain impartial when I lean on objective criteria and rational thinking. I apply scoring systems, an objective tool to measure ideas against goals. Most importantly though, I acknowledge and compensate for my personal biases often – this shows me my “weak spots” and allows me to proactively identify biases and prejudices that may arise in my initial reaction(s).
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Computing and weighing the risks and benefits of any strategy is a must – and I excel at both. As a marginalized citizen since my birth, I learned to analyze experiences early because I sought clarity for myself and grew increasingly curious about the world. This lifetime practice of curiosity showed me that our liberation is interconnected, and from an early age, I sharpened the power of visualization – the ability to see the potential in things beyond what they currently are, a critical skill to analytical thinking. Living against the grain of privilege, show(s) me how to challenge assertions and find loopholes in proposed solutions – accessing data to find hidden opportunities and telling trends. My life experience of being a political refugee, an assimilating immigrant, to a naturalized U.S. citizen, taught me how to leverage limited resource; understand complex problems; and develop the most suitable course of action towards my goals. Analytical thinking is what allowed me to survive once, and now it lets me thrive.
