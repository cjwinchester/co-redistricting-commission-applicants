<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe this commission provides a unique opportunity to minimize parochial interests in the drafting of congressional boundaries and provide some certainty to Colorado citizens that their respective communities will be fairly represented in districts that were logically and reasonably drawn.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I represent one side of the political spectrum. But as a conservative at Harvard Law, in my early 30s, I ran for student government at the Law School on the theme &quot;Agreeing to Disagree&quot;. I was elected my last two years of law school on that theme. I believe nothing is gained by always disagreeing with those who disagree with me. Instead, I need to seek common ground. In the military, you got the opportunity to work with folks with whom you would not necessarily choose to interact socially. However, we had a mission...and the mission was more important that the personalities. I see this committee in a similar fashion. We have a mission. The best way to accomplish that mission is to seek consensus, and work logically through problem areas. Ultimately, there must be a product and hence, there must be consensus. I would work hard to build bridges of consensus.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Most people would agree that a lawyer works to apply logic to problem-solve. But my work life prior to going to law school:
1)  flying fighters, 
2)  doing intelligence analysis of &quot;hot spots&quot; in the Middle East for Central Command and 
3)  commanding the first combined space test and aggressor squadron in the history of the Air Force...
These diverse, unique jobs required me to problem solve even more (in my opinion) that my law practice. Sometimes, lives (including my own) could be at stake in the problem-solving I did in the Air Force.
