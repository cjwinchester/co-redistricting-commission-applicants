<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>

- Developed internal communication strategy for union communication to bargaining unit members.
- Did legal and regulatory research for collective bargaining and provided ongoing research and assistance on disability issues, reasonable accommodation, dispute resolution, and other workplace issues.

When I worked for Smithsonian Magazine I brought up the lack of diversity among our freelance writers. The response was that writers of color did not submit article proposals to us. I pointed out that many of our writers had social and educational connections to editors and that without those kinds of connections, it was incumbent upon us to reach out to writers of color. When I suggested engaging professional writer’s groups like the National Association of Black Journalists or the Asian American Journalists Association, the editor said good writers don’t belong to writer’s groups. I shared that while this might be true for white writers, good writers of color participate whole heartedly in these types of organizations precisely because they don’t have the same type of access and connections as their white counterparts. As a woman of color, I was able to provide a perspective that was unique and different from that of my colleagues.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Colorado took an important step in voting to establish an independent redistricting commission.  Equally important is the composition of the commissions. As a member of the commission I will be able to communicate with citizens and community leaders about the importance of redistricting and the impact it has on how votes are counted. I will be able to build confidence among citizens that their voice is being heard and their interests are being represented. I possess the skills and abilities to help ensure that gerrymandering (whether racial or political) does not take place, particularly since we no longer have the protections of the Voting Rights Act. Both my personal and professional background give me experience in collaboration and consensus building.  My master’s in public administration gives me the educational foundation in research and analytic methods, statistics, public policy research, and community engagement that will be key to this work. My professional experience as an analyst for the federal government gives me the ability to perform the research and analysis that will also be required by this work. My experience in civic engagement has prepared me to seek and respond to community input.

As an active and involved community member, I will bring energy and insight to the commission.  I relish the opportunity to serve the people of Colorado by being a fair, open-minded, collaborative, passionate member of the commission working to ensure that everyone’s voice is heard, and interests are protected. I believe the diversity I would bring to the commission is invaluable, but I want to represent all people of Colorado.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I would like to give an example of how I promote consensus and agreement in my job. Recently while supervising the CARES COVID-19 Emergency Assistance program for Jefferson County Human Services, I encountered a manager who was denying assistance requests even though they met all criteria. I spoke with her about why she was denying these requests and learned that she did not feel the applicants had been impacted by COVID.  I came up with the idea of asking these applicants for a COVID Impact Statement giving details about how they were impacted and for what months. By doing this, we learned details that were not evident from the applications, and all of the previous denials were reversed. While others simply felt the manager’s denials were unfair, I sought to understand her underlying concerns and realized she was trying to do her due diligence. I found a way to meet everyone’s needs and get the job done. This is the type of skill and attitude I would bring to the commission. I believe people can disagree without being disagreeable. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As I have stated previously, my educational, professional, and personal background have all prepared me for the work of the commission. My master’s in public administration gives me the educational foundation in research and analytic methods, statistics, public policy research, and community engagement that will be key to this work. My professional experience as an analyst for the federal government gives me the ability to perform the research and analysis that will also be required by this work.  My work requires me to gather data, analyze, make decisions, and problem solve on a daily basis.
