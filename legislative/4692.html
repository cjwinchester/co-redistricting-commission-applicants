As a member of the Colorado Disability Funding Committee, I have the privilege of helping award grants to deserving non-profit organizations that serve Colorado&#39;s disability community.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
This Commission will be one of the most important efforts in the history of this state. Non-partisan redistricting can return fairness to our elections, faith in the political process, and help alleviate our polarized politics by ensuring that voters choose their representatives--not the other way around--and that districts are geographically sensible and reflect the balanced political affiliations of our electorate. I can think of no better way to serve my community and my state. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I consider myself a pragmatic idealist. I am committed to a vision of progress but follow the facts as I find them and make decisions based on fairness and reason. I am committed to fairness and reason above all else, including party affiliation--after all, no victory is truly earned if the game is rigged. This philosophy guides not only my personal decision-making but my board responsibilities and legal practice, too. My clients expect me to fight for a cause, but more importantly they expect me to resolve matters as quickly and efficiently as possible. Good lawyers solve problems, they do not create them, and I&#39;m proud that the vast majority of cases I handle are resolved amicably. The boards that I serve on are non-partisan groups dedicated to advancing a cause. Nothing gets done without a majority vote, and there is no majority unless we can find common ground and make progress. Nearly every vote I have cast on a board has been unanimous or near-unanimous, not because the issues were easy, but because we built consensus and agreed to collectively act in a way that advances the interests of our board, and those we serve, not ourselves. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As an attorney, I am hired to spot issues, think critically about how to solve them, and clearly articulate a solution. As a member of several community boards, I am entrusted to identify and explain my positions on policy questions to a diverse group of extremely smart and dedicated people. I apply logic and reason all day, every day. That is the nature of my work, but it is also what drives me. As discussed, I am a pragmatic idealist who is committed to a vision of progress but will follow the facts as I find them and make decisions based on fairness and reason.
