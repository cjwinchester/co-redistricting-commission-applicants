<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am a Black, educated female, educated in higher-education and employed by the State of Colorado. My experience as a leader, teacher and scholar has served the under-privileged and disenfranchised whether in the youth adjudicated system, adult probation/parole, drug and alcohol treatment, staff, and as resident of my community of 35 years. I would serve on the Commission to ensure equitable and fair representation for the communities. My voice is to advocate for equity that has long separated suburbia from urban and rural opportunities. In addition, my community work consisted of being the face for under-represented and under- privileged citizens of Colorado which has honored me by the Colorado Springs Business Journal “2010 Women of Influence” I was nominated and chosen with seven other women. My background in statistics, and urban development is limited; however, I am resourceful and willing to learn to ensure the redistricting is a successful project.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My experiences have been vast with special populations and people in need. My empathy comes from my stewardship in the Colorado Springs, Pueblo and at times Denver communities in the capacity of a social worker, clinician (mental health and addiction), mid-level manager, and parent. Furthermore, my life involves Military Veterans/Wounded Warrior/and Disabled Veterans. Empathy is paramount working with our Veterans of Colorado, or offenders who have lost their privileges in society, and our elderly seniors. Notwithstanding individuals who have lost their voice from the pain of addiction and trauma; we all have a right to be heard and I am capable of speaking for those who are unable and incapable of speaking for themselves that services are provided to them.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My analytical skills were developed overtime as a mid-level manager working with adjudicated youth in the penal system. As well as a student seeking a post-graduate degree in clinical psychology. Brainstorming with my staff of 48, due 2001 recession limited Colorado’s budgets; I was on a strategic planning team with management to identify meaningful ways to improve our sustainability. Critical thinking skills were an essential process for managing behaviors and setting standards to gain the trust and effects of all people. The communication is an expectation to reach agreements, and successful outcomes. My experiences were both good and challenging. As a woman of color it was incumbent upon me to verbalize the needs of others and address the challenges we were faced with without being offending or causing others to feel uncomfortable. My use of resources and support helped in this process of which helped to solve problems and build respect from individual clients, patients, families, and the multi-disciplinary team within a community. Research skills were developed during my post-graduate degrees in clinical doctorate program and Master’s program, life experiences, as well as on- the- job learning.
