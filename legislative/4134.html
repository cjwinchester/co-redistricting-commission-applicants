<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
This election year I have made calls for Joe Biden’s campaign, which I have enjoyed doing and found rewarding. Those calls have been in 2-3 hour blocks and focused on swing states. Additionally, I&#39;ve made small scale donations to ActBlue for Joe Biden&#39;s campaign, as well as for the campaigns of democratic Senate candidates (Jaime Harrison, Sara Gideon, Amy McGrath, and Diane Mitch Bush.)
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
SURJ
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I am involved in my local SURJ chapter here in Denver. SURJ (Showing Up for Racial Justice) is a national network of groups and individuals working for racial justice. I’m a member of the Advocacy and Policy working group that focuses on applying pressure to local government leadership to promote BIPOC-led initiatives. Specifically, I work on the Actions and Civic Engagement subgroup, which works to mobilize and prepare guidance for folks who want to participate in civic processes to affect change for racial justice. I believe that in order for the needs of our communities to be rightfully addressed it is absolutely critical that our marginalized community members achieve political equity. I also believe change must come from citizens like me who are willing to listen to those in marginalized communities, acknowledge our privilege and access, and use our power to elevate the voices of marginalized citizens by working alongside them. Systemic change will only come through a collective effort to bring those from marginalized groups into power, while also demonstrating that one need not be a member of a marginalized community in order to fight for their rights, value their lives, and work on their behalf. By working together, we can mobilize across communities and impact larger social change that fairly represents all Coloradans.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that the right to vote is perhaps the most important right that those in a Democracy are entitled to. However, I also believe that due to systemic barriers, many are unable to access that right as freely as others. I would like to be a part of changing that. I do not subscribe to the idea of individualism in a civil society. I believe it’s our duty, our moral obligation to take care of one another. To me, serving on this commission would be an opportunity to help and take care of my fellow Coloradans.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
When I decided to go to graduate school at the age of 30, leaving behind the administrative career I’d worked hard for to pursue my dream of earning my MFA and becoming a writer, I did so for the education and experience. What I hadn’t expected was that the community of cohorts I would gain would be just as instrumental in my success, perhaps even more so, than the education itself. One of the core values of our program was to listen to, and provide respectful, helpful feedback to, our cohorts. We did not all hold the same ideas, and it was integral to our collective success to acknowledge that not one of us held paramount influence than the other. I believe the same will be true with this commission. In order to best work together, we will need to go beyond being willing to listen to one another and move into the terrain of finding value in the information that one another presents. Additionally, I think it will be imperative to keep in mind that the results of this commission are ultimately not about the commission members, but about the people of Colorado and best representing and supporting their rights.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In my corporate career as a copywriter I was often tasked with taking varying perspectives on an idea or product and conflating them into one unified point of view. A part of successfully accomplishing this was the ability to be objective in my approach, as well as separate the different sources of information by their motive, or cause, and then find the effect of each. In copywriting, as with most things, this is not easy to do. However the difficulty of the task does not outweigh its importance. I would take a similar approach when working on this commission. I would do my absolute best to look at each piece of information and each point of view with a fresh lens, and then try to find the best path forward to create the effect most desirable for all involved.
