        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Lara Grosjean</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Lara Grosjean
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Lara Hammerick</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently unemployed due to the pandemic. We have our own business but I took a lay-off so we could keep others on the payroll. Once we are able to support additional employees, I will be employed at CityROCK.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I graduated with a BA from Yale University and got my MBA from the University of Denver.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80905
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not made any donations to campaigns or organizations.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Since 2015, I have mainly been involved in organizations at our childrens’ schools and in our neighborhood.  I also interacted with a variety of non-profits that partnered with our indoor climbing gym, CityROCK, during my time as the General Manager.  I served as a reading volunteer at Gold Camp Elementary as well as a presenter and volunteer for Art in a Suitcase at both Gold Camp and Skyway Elementary Schools.

Most of my positions have been informal – I like organizing events and typically get involved in any community of which I am a part.  For example, our family sailed around the world as part of a rally called the World ARC.  There were a number of boats with children on them.  I organized a Halloween party for all the kids from various countries with activities typical of what we do for the holiday in the US.  In Spain, our children attended a local school and I helped with the Halloween party there, mainly assisting with decorating for a haunted house.  On the sailing trip, I also organized a talent show for the children on the boats traveling together.  This took place at a marina in Richard’s Bay, South Africa, which was attended by about 75 spectators.  I also wrote a satirical “radio” play which the adult members of the rally performed in front of the audience.

During the pandemic, I organized two neighborhood parades, one for the 4th of July and one for Halloween (a favorite holiday of mine if it isn’t obvious by now).  This served a dual purpose of allowing the children of the neighborhood to participate in the holiday as well as engaging the elderly folks in our neighborhood who came out to watch the children and feel like they could also participate in a manner that didn’t put them at risk.  Both these events have created an increased sense of camaraderie in our neighborhood and I anticipate that they will become annual traditions.

I have also participated in a variety of clean-up events in Colorado Springs and elsewhere in the world.  During our travels, we learned about an Australian organization called “3 for the Sea” which encourages people everywhere to pick up three pieces of trash daily that might otherwise end up in the sea.  Our family participated in this ritual during the duration of our trip and, to this day, if our kids see a piece of stray trash, they will say, “One for the Sea!” when picking it up.

Part of the reason I am applying for this position is that I feel that, with our three children now in school, I am in a position to give back to my community here in Colorado in a more formal way.  Until now, with three small children and a business to run, I didn’t have the capacity to pursue other opportunities.

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Through CityROCK, we are partnered with a number of non-profit organizations and schools and I have worked with all of them to promote our common interests. Through our climbing gym, we have supported The North Face’s effort to make climbing a more inclusive sport by hosting Walls Are Meant for Climbing events. I helped found the Colorado High School Climbing League that got high school climbing off the ground in Colorado and I continue to be an advisor to that organization. When I worked as a Fellow at El Pomar Foundation, I was the co-chair of a program called Seniors in Service. Participating seniors engaged in a series of volunteer projects hosted by local non-profits. Then we put on a grant-making workshop where the seniors granted out funds donated by El Pomar Foundation to non-profits who met their goals for fund distribution. Since this time, I have felt a special fondness for senior organizations and causes.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My main motivation for serving on the commission is that it would offer me a way to give back to my community.  In various conversations with friends and colleagues, I recognize that I have complained about various issues in our community but feel like I haven’t done enough to help solve them.  I see the commission as a unique opportunity to contribute to the foundation of the political structure in our state.  I attended an on-line information session out of curiosity, thinking I would tune in for a few minutes and then slip out.  Instead, I left being very impressed both with the presenter and with the infrastructure that Colorado has in place to ensure that both its state and national representatives are truly representative of the people that live in our state.

Our home in Colorado Springs is on the east side of a main road that divides several older neighborhoods.  This road also serves as a dividing line between one zip code and another, one school zone and another.  Because we live on the east side, we don’t receive a newsletter or special advertising offers targeted to the “elite” zip code.  Because we live on the east side, we have to apply to attend the “elite” elementary school.  Because we live on the east side, we are treated differently by those on the west side.  It’s not a huge difference, but I understand the significance of arbitrary lines on a map.  Those lines make a difference to the people who live there and it’s critically important that they be drawn fairly.  In my case, the issues are so minor as to be irrelevant but I know that’s not the case with political representation when it can mean a difference between feeling like you have a voice in government and feeling like you never will.  During this time of intense division in our country, it’s important for people to feel like divisions imposed upon them are fair and well-considered.  

I majored in political science and thought I would become a lawyer.  I spent a fair amount of time considering a career in public service, largely because I enjoy helping others and contributing at a meaningful level to worthwhile causes.  Although I diverged from the path I set out on many years ago, I realize that I still have that itch to participate in the public sector and to help our communities find ways to come together.  It’s ironic in some ways that the path to more togetherness might actually come from drawing clear lines on a map to separate people.  However, I have learned, from both parenting and from professional experience, that the clearer the boundaries, the better the relationships.

I think my diverse background in education, government, non-profits, and as an entrepreneur will allow me to consider a diverse set of viewpoints.  In addition to my wide range of professional experience, I have also worked in, lived in, and traveled to many different countries.  I understand that all of us have different goals, aspirations and dreams but usually we are also fundamentally interested in most of the same things.  All the people that I’ve met are usually happiest when they have a secure source of income, access to good healthcare, and have a secure, positive environment in which to pursue their goals.  We don’t always see the same path to getting there but, if we can agree on where we want to go, the rest doesn’t always matter. 

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I feel like I have spent most of my professional life working to promote consensus.  Being in business with my husband has forced me to develop a wide range of skills and tools that I didn’t possess before.  While we both have the best interests of the business at heart, we rarely agree on how to reach our goals.  I like structure, systems, and communication.  He prefers to be on the spot, making the decisions as the situation requires.  I lead with logic, he leads with emotion.  This can be incredibly frustrating for both of us and for our staff but it has also meant that we have developed a robust, profitable business with a heart.  

With the current pandemic, we have had numerous difficult conversations with the GM who has been running our climbing gym for the past several years.  With the new restrictions on gyms triggered by our county’s rising pandemic numbers, my husband, our GM, and I had three different ideas of how to proceed.  After a day or two of all of us being willing to observe what was really happening and not be entrenched in our positions, an obvious solution arose that was a combination of what each of us had wanted.  During this process, and in most situations, I find that I can see value in all sides.  Sometimes one idea is clearly superior but often there are many good solutions and the best one is the one that is easiest to implement.

I feel that one of my biggest strengths that I would bring to the commission is to see both sides of an issue.  In high school in south Texas, I was a proficient Lincoln-Douglas (L-D) debater.  I won a number of tournaments and eventually qualified for state and national-level events.  In L-D debate, you have to argue both sides of the issue.  Later in life, I realized what a valuable skill this was.  Not only did I have to research and write convincing speeches about real-world topics, but I had to argue against someone else in a manner that convinced the judge that I was more compelling.  This meant that I had to be sincere in what I was saying and truly understand both sides of issues like capital punishment, civil disobedience, the right to bear arms, and many other issues that have been and continue to be critical issues in our society.  While my high school debate years are long over, I feel that I still possess the desire and ability to consider both sides of an issue before making a decision.  This is probably why I have always registered as an Independent.  While I have strong beliefs, I don’t feel that they are always adequately addressed by a single party and I would rather not feel like I ever vote the “party line.”

I also feel that my set of life experiences has given me common ground with many people.  I grew up in Corpus Christi, Texas which had a large Hispanic population.  My mother grew up in Cuba and spoke fluent Spanish.  I was always proud that my mother could speak more than one language and, with some help from her, as well as time spent in Spanish-speaking countries, I eventually became proficient in her native language.  I vowed that my children would do the same.  We established a close relationship with a Peruvian family in Colorado Springs and they helped care for our children when they were very young and taught them Spanish as well as aspects of their culture.  From this family, I learned about some of the struggles of first-generation immigrants to our country and the fears and difficulties that they have.  I have family members that hunt and farm and ranch, others that are vegetarians, city-dwellers, and opposed to guns.  Within my extended family, we have had representatives in all branches of the armed forces as well as those that have protested against the military.  We have churchgoers and atheists, occasionally under the same roof.  There are same-sex couples, adopted children, Republicans, and Democrats.  It’s probably very much like many other families across the state and the country.  While I don’t always agree with all of them, we have found ways to co-exist and have mutual respect for one another.

I would bring all of these skills to the redistricting commission.  I would listen to others’ viewpoints and use my background experiences to try to understand where other members were coming from.  If needed, I would visit areas of concern and see firsthand what problems needed to be addressed.  I would help brainstorm solutions with the other commissioners to see if we could find an unexpected answer to any problems we encountered.  Above all, I would be respectful and considerate of the viewpoints of others.   I firmly believe that everyone deserves a voice and would work hard to help all voices be heard and considered.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As the leader of a business, I have used analytical skills on a regular basis for the past decade.  I created the Excel spreadsheets for our company’s annual budget, with each department having a budget that feeds into the overall budget.  I managed the payroll, taxes, and balanced the accounts.  Over the years, I have resorted to Excel to create models for different scenarios to show how they might impact the business.  In my time at El Pomar Foundation, I learned to perform strategic planning for our Seniors in Service program.  

Critical thinking skills are also essential in running a business and a family.  We are constantly prioritizing and making choices on the best use of our time and resources.  Currently, we are considering expanding our business and have been doing analysis to determine the best location for a new gym.  The public library has excellent resources that we used to research demographics and spending trends across the city.  Our team used this information to whittle down areas where we think we will be most successful.  

Regardless of the strength of any of our abilities, I believe that if we can’t communicate what we’re thinking and feeling, our strengths are useless.  In a service-based industry, it is imperative that we communicate effectively.  During the pandemic, the importance of effective communication has become even more critical.  Constant changes are hard for a business to absorb but they also give us numerous opportunities to solve new problems and communicate those solutions to the public.  We typically address new ideas by gathering internal opinions, then reaching out to our members to get their opinions via surveys and in-person interviews.  We then take all this data and put it together and meet with the department leaders to decide on a course of action.  This allows us to reach a consensus that is based on input from a variety of sources rather than any one person’s beliefs.  In addition, this process allows our customers and employees a voice, giving them more understanding of how we reached our decision.  Even if they don’t agree with the outcome, I believe that allowing them the opportunity to be heard lets them know that their opinions were considered.
