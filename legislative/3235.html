<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Prior to moving to Colorado in 1981, I could have been characterized as a moderate Republican or independent.  Upon arrival in Colorado I saw that the Colorado Democratic party was more suited to me.  I have been a volunteer in Denver Democratic party activity since 1982, including prior service as a precinct captain [n/k/a PCP] for my local precinct and as an occasional delegate to county or state Democratic conventions.  I continue to attend the local House District 6 monthly meetings as an &quot;activist&quot; and as a &quot;block captain&quot; for Precinct 607.  I also served as a finance committee co-chair for Andrew Romanoff&#39;s  US Senate primary race against Michael Bennett back in 2008/2009.   
Campaigns to which I have donated money over the past 5 years include the following: Ed Perlmutter for Governor, Mike Johnston for DPS Board, Phil Weiser for Colorado, Emily Sirota for Colorado, Jason Crow for Congress, Janice Gilles for Denver, Andrew Romanoff for Colorado, Chris Hansen for Senate, Denver Democratic Party, Joe Biden for President, Colorado Democratic Senate Committee, Mitch Bush for Congress
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
The organizations to which I have belonged during the past 5 years include the Denver Democratic Party,  Colorado Yale Association,  Rocky Mountain Map Society,  Denver Council on Foreign Relations,  Reach Out and Read Colorado, and Historic Montclair Community Association Inc
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have served on the boards of the following organizations: Volunteers for Outdoor Colorado, Colorado Yale Association, Yale Alumni Association, Summer Scholars [n/k/a Scholars Unlimited], and Reach Out and Read Colorado.  I was a board chair for one term for one of these, a secretary of the board for one and a treasurer and finance committee chair for another.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
This will be an historic activity for our State.   And, to the extent that lawyers are problem solvers, I see myself as a good problem solver.  I want to help create fair maps so that in the future all the interested parties In Colorado can save the time and money  previously  spent on the &quot;map&quot; controversy and devote their money and attention to more productive activities.   Then some of my early interests may serve me well on the commission, such as working for a civil engineer/surveyor in high school, doing surveys and drafting sub-division maps, taking statistics in college before switching to a political science major, and taking a real estate planning and zoning  class during law school.  And one cannot be a lawyer in Colorado for long [I arrived here in 1981] without working on real estate transactions and oil/gas/mining transactions - which I did.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that my Board activities helped me see how important consensus building was for the success of the particular corporate entity.  Two areas of those activities stand out in this regard: strategic planning and executive search.  I was involved in 2 or 3 strategic planning efforts and  two recent search committees for an executive director.  Being open and fair to all opinions in the strategic planning efforts were essential to getting buy-in from all parties.   Then in the executive search efforts, I believe we were more successful when we were consistent and respectful to the applicants as well as to each other on the committees; and by listening well to all applicants at in-person interviews and being fair to all until final decision making resulted in a successful employment experience.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My 40 years of law practice helped me with the analytic skills needed to apply reason and logic to any problem presented.  My ordering of those skills would be: critical thinking, research, creative analytical and communication.
