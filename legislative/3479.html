</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a health disparities, community-based, health promotion researcher, I have 30 years experience bringing key stakeholders together for cancer prevention education and control.  I was the head/principal investigator for a National Cancer Institute funded project that built a Front Range network of 44 community groups, organizations, and scientists to address Latino/a cancer disparities in Colorado.  We reached thousands of Colorado Latinos through our community education activities and &quot;train-the trainer&quot; workshops. I am also the former Chair of the Colorado Cancer Coalition, which is a statewide coalition of academic, medical, and community organizations focused on cancer prevention and control in Colorado. The Colorado Cancer Coalition takes primary responsibility for drafting the Colorado Cancer Plan, every 5 years, providing guidance for funding and cancer prevention and monitoring efforts for the State. This is accomplished through a collaborative effort of the members of the Coalition.  Finally, as a community-based, researcher, I have conducted numerous community education and &quot;town hall&quot; type meetings to seek community input and disseminate our research findings.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As a retired person, I have the time to be more involved in civic activities and this is an important task.  I have the skills and competencies needed to positively contribute to the  job needed for this commission.  I consider myself to be fair-minded, am willing and able to work with individuals from diverse political perspectives, and would take the work of this commission seriously.  I have previous experience serving on the State Commission on Tobacco and Chronic Disease Programs, as their health disparities expert.  It was an honor and a privilege to serve the State of Colorado. I just recently. became aware of this application process and the lack of diversity among the applicants.  I think it is important to have a diverse commission that represents the population of Colorado, as much as possible. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Having served on a State Commission in the past (Colorado Tobacco and Chronic Disease Program Commission), I understand that members will have different views and perspectives that must be seriously considered in order to reach consensus.  I will promote consensus by taking my Charge (provided by the State of Colorado) seriously, by committing to listening to my fellow commissioners, and by contributing my knowledge and expertise to discussions and work of the Commission.  I do not expect to always get my way and will do my best to work for the good of all of the people of Colorado. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a retired PhD researcher in health disparities, I have 30 years experience in applying analytical skills, logic, and reason to complex problems.  I have experience conducting relevant background research (what we already know) to find gaps and relevant next steps to answering questions. Health disparities are the result of a complex set of social, behavioral, environmental, and biological factors. Through my work, I have experience navigating these different set of factors through various forms of analysis. When thinking about how to address the social factors, we often use what is referred to as a &quot;logic model&quot; for planning and implementing an evidence-based intervention. Facts and evidence should drive one&#39;s work in addressing complex social problems.  In public policy work, which is an end goal of some of these interventions, it is important to first identify and agree on the problem.  This seems obvious, but if stakeholders cannot agree on what the problem is...making headway will be very difficult.
