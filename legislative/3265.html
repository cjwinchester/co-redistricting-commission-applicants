        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Helen Kay Kaupang</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Helen Kay Kaupang
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Retired (September 2017) from US Department of Justice/Drug Enforcement Administration/Denver Division Office after 29 years of service in various field offices and agency headquarters.  
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  BA Degree, Human Service Administration, Fort Lewis College, Durango, Colorado 1975
9 weeks of Basic Diversion Investigator training at the FBI/DEA Training Academy in Quantico, VA 1988
Numerous investigative, technology, and management courses over the length of my employment with DEA.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80120
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not been politically active.  This is due mostly to the Hatch Act and limitations regarding federal employee involvement with political activities.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I volunteered through Denver Rescue Mission working with a Family Rescue client who was being resettled after homelessness (2018).  I have been an active member at South Fellowship Church, Littleton, CO, for fifteen years; I have worked with our children&#39;s ministry and on a women&#39;s ministry leadership team.  While I was still employed, I served on Gov. Hickenlooper&#39;s task force through the National Governors&#39; Association Prescription Drug Policy Academy that  initiated the creation of the Colorado Consortium for Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention.  I served on the executive board for several years prior to my retirement.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
In 2012/2013 I served on Gov. Hickenlooper&#39;s task force through the National Governors&#39; Association Prescription Drug Policy Academy that  initiated the creation of the Colorado Consortium for Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention.  At that time, Colorado was in the top 5 states in the nation inundated with prescription drug abuse.  Both professionally and personally, I was concerned for the trend that was undercutting the health and well being of my home state.  I became vested in the work being done by the Governor&#39;s Office, offering my professional expertise to help educate the team on regulatory requirements and the reasons behind them.  I attended seminars and roundtable discussions to learn and discuss best practices for a wide range of professions including medical, education, behavioral health, and law enforcement.  Together we created a path forward for Colorado to reduce the prescription drug abuse problems.  During the same time frame, I was leading my group of investigators in one of the largest investigations conducted in DEA history against a major industry player, a drug distribution corporation, who was blatantly involved in the diversion of controlled pharmaceutical products across the United States, including Colorado.  

I was assigned the job related duty to coordinate and orchestrate the DEA&#39;s National Take Back Initiative (NTBI) for proper disposal of prescription drugs throughout Colorado. I built a coalition of federal and state partners and recruited local law enforcement agencies throughout Colorado to successfully host and attain twelve biannual events.  Throughout my involvement in the NTBI, I coordinated with Division personnel in 4 states to achieve 100% environmentally friendly destruction of all collected drugs.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have always been civic minded and interested in the &quot;big picture&quot; mechanics of what makes our social and judicial systems work or fail to work.  I enjoyed the regulatory aspects of my paid profession as well as networking with a diverse cross section of law enforcement, industry, and regulatory agencies to ensure that there was a reliable supply of controlled substance medications available to meet the legitimate medical, scientific, and research needs of our country.  I believe that serving on the Commission is an important duty and that I have skills and abilities to contribute towards the work being done.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I will make a concerted effort to be an informed participant. I am a good listener and  I ask good questions in order to make sure that what I am hearing is, in fact, what is being said.   Having been raised on the Western Slope and living there for many years before living on the front range, I care about the whole of Colorado,  I understand some of the differences which exist between city dwellers and our rural residents.  The job I held required that I study divergent points of view and yet gain a consensus or at least arrive at a solution which was acceptable to all parties.  I believe through my years of working as well as years of being a parent, I learned the ability to be fair and impartial in my assessments of situations and to arrive at successful conclusions.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
One example:  before I worked with the federal government, I was trained as an intelligence analyst for the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.  I worked an unsolved murder case and had to review and analyze a wide range of potential evidentiary material.   I had to review material and determine what was relevant evidence.  I was tasked with creating a time line and inputting the relevant evidence; that process allowed me to see where things matched up or to discern when the evidence was at odds.  Through this effort, I was able to offer the detectives another opinion of who may have committed the crime.   I think this early training provided me with a good skill that served me, my agency, and my co-workers well throughout my career.
