<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I started donating to candidates in my late 20s while living in Texas.  I did not volunteer with any campaigns or other political organizations until 2012, while living at my current address in CO.  I did some canvassing for the Obama campaign that year, and also volunteered for Joe Miklosi, running for CD 6.  Since then, I have donated to and done volunteer work for several local candidates.  A full list of candidates (locally and nationally) that I have donated to since 2015 is attached. I made small donations to candidates and organizations in other jurisdictions, but focus more of my contributions to local candidates and the local and state party.  The peak of my direct volunteer work for a candidate was for Andrew Romanoff for CO-6 in 2014. I worked 2-3 hours per week for 6 months or more for that campaign.  I volunteered for three Aurora city council candidates in 2019, Juan Marcano, Allison Coombs and Bryan Lindstrom.  I also canvassed and made phone calls for Omar Montgomery for Aurora Mayor.  I have volunteered with the Arapahoe County Democratic Party with some regularity since 2016.  I served on the organizing committee for the 2019 Pat Schroeder Dinner.  I have attended the Democratic Caucus since 2016. I have served as a PCP for my neighborhood since 2016 as well.

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Trinity University Alumni Association Colorado Chapter board July 2015 - June 2018.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have 20+ years of experience facilitating complex stakeholder requirements for IT projects.

It is critical to successful systems development to understand the different interests that the project is intended to serve, including those that are less influential, who are nonetheless impacted by project design choices.  In my role as business analyst, I am responsible for managing stakeholder interests and requirements processes.

In a well organized IT project, there are three main phases, and stakeholders must be involved in each.  Requirements gathering includes identifying new stakeholders and what they want and need from the project.  Project design and development involves getting buy-in from the stakeholders, especially where their requirements may not be met perfectly or in a different way than they anticipated.  Testing and implementation ultimately must include representatives of all stakeholders to ensure that the requirements and design are implemented well and without unintended consequences.  

The challenge of systems development is building a complex solution that honors the requirements of the entire stakeholder community.

I expect the work of the commission to follow a similar path.  We must first identify stakeholders (including communities of interest) and requirements (including statutory and constitutional requirements).  We must then design a process for scoring how well a map addresses interests of the stakeholders and requirements.  We must then test potential maps and build consensus around districts that best address those interests and requirements.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I deeply believe in democracy and the importance of diversity of opinion, inclusion in decision making and the concept of one person one vote.  I appreciate the importance of district boundaries and their potential to produce representation that either accurately or inaccurately reflect the composition of the people they serve.  I am a strong supporter of the concept of independent commissions for redistricting, and have been interested in serving since I first read about the Colorado proposals in 2017/18.  I have turned down nominations to serve on Democratic Party committees above the PCP level to maintain eligibility for the commission.  I believe my combination of analytical skills and passion for representative government make me an ideal contributor to the commission.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Each of us is influenced by learned and chosen biases.  Understanding and declaring my own biases is the first step to building trust within the commission.  Understanding and respecting the other commissioners perspectives is another key part of building trust within the commission.  That trust will help build consensus or at least create sufficient agreement to accomplish the work set in front of us.  

There are many different factors that must be considered in the redistricting process. Development of a scoring system for determining how well each map accomplishes different objectives will be an important step in helping the commission meet the objectives of fairness and impartiality.  I have extensive experience building measurement systems that yield minimally biased results.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
With my BA in Math and focus on computer science, I have training and long practice in breaking down problems and applying logic and algorithms to solve them.

I am also a professional database developer, with focus on analytic reporting, so I have a deep understanding and long term interest in how data is and should be stored and presented to accurately reflect the real world information it represents.  

I am able to quickly and thoroughly understand cause and effect interactions in complex systems, whether they are data processing systems, or real world political, social and economic systems.  One of my gifts is my ability to break down complex systems into manageable components, while maintaining awareness of the big picture.

In several cases through my career I have used this ability to identify reasonable and accurate solutions to problems believed by &quot;experts&quot; to be unsolvable.
