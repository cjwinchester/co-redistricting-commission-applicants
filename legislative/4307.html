</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80525
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have served as a precinct captain once, and knocked on doors or made phone calls to turn out voters before elections many times. I have also done voter registration activities and participated in multiple demonstrations.  My husband and I contributed to Fair Fight, MoveOn, and Act Blue in 2019 and 2020.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Together Baton Rouge, Together Louisiana, American Association of University Women, Santa Rosa Neighborhood Association, MoveOn, American Sociological Association, Village Cooperative of Fort Collins, gardening and library committees of VCFC 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
When I wrote my dissertation and book on the politics of health care policy, I spent a good deal of time considering the interests of various associations and advocacy groups. I have also both organized and attempted to organize groups and organizations, advocated for them, and occasionally represented them.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am very interested in the purpose of the commission, and feel that it is extremely important work, which needs to be done well this first time in order to set a fair pattern for the future.  I have skills relevant to both the work itself and to the challenges likely to confront the commission, and believe that my participation would help serve the purposes and goals of the commission.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I expect that there will be several deep divisions on both commissions, and believe that I would bring some skills to the table to help bridge those divides.  These skills were developed while working with people with views I did not share; in particular, I taught Sociology for many years to students whose backgrounds did not prepare them to accept the premises or results of social research.  I have learned to speak softly while actively seeking out the relevant perceptions of the people I work with, in order to develop a sense of shared values and goals, and to avoid giving offense unintentionally. That process requires active listening, which I find invaluable in reaching common ground and achieving a civil level of discourse. Once I feel that I know the main similarities and differences in our perceptions, I work at couching my questions and points in terms of the shared values and goals I have identified, to help the other person hear what I am saying. While I may be strongly opinionated about topics where I believe that I know the relevant facts, I have worked hard to learn to treat communication as a process requiring fairness to all persons and point of view. 
The same approaches are useful in helping other people actually hear one another in a discussion, or at least to clarify where language or presumptions are getting in the way of understanding. When perceptual or interest differences are incompatible for completing a common goal, as may be true on this commission, I find it helpful to acknowledge such differences  and the presumptions that tend to accompany those differences in thinking about the people on the other side.  On occasion, I have been able to reduce some conflicts by imposing a linguistic or point-of-view rule (as the classroom instructor) or by asking a group to reach a majority opinion on such a rule to govern the rest of a groupâ€™s discussions. In particular, I expect the commissions will have to deal with some harsh assessments of the motivations of members or citizens championing opposing sides of the various stakeholder issues that will be brought up.  I make no claim to be able to solve such conflicts, but I believe that I can be a helpful voice in keeping the discourse civil and productive.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My experience and training have helped me develop many analytical skills, including spotting gaps or problems in proposals, fallacies in arguments, and utilizing data charts to clarify the implications of data. I am not perfect at any of these, but often find myself doing more of each than the people I work with.  Each is an exercise in logic, and my object in using analytic skills is always problem solving. I would refer anyone interested in my skills to my 2006 book, Solving the Health Care Problem.
