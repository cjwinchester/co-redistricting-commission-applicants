<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Currently, I serve as a precinct chair-person for CO Precinct 411. In this role, I participate in voter outreach strategy meetings led by our area coordinator and other precinct leads and am responsible for leading the Get out the Vote activities in my precinct. This includes recruiting volunteers to make phone calls, send text messages and distribute vote notes. We recently learned that our precinct had a 96% voter turn out rate for the 2020 election. This election, I also volunteered with the Colorado Democrats to do voter outreach on behalf of the Biden Campaign via text and phone banking as well as the same activities for Planned Parent Federation and the No On 115 campaign. Additionally, I wrote postcards for local Democratic candidate campaigns in Colorado, including Rep. Kyle Mullica (HD 34), Yadira Caraveo (HD 31),  Susan Lontine (HD 1) and Katie Barrett (Democratic challenger, HD 45). I also wrote 100 get out the vote letters to voters in Pennsylvania for the Blue Revolution Postcard/Letter writing campaign. Pre-covid, during the Democratic primaries, I did in-person canvassing for Elizabeth Warren&#39;s campaign. I made monetary donations to the Biden-Harris Campaign, Kyle Mullica&#39;s campaign, the Boulder Democratic Party and the Elizabeth Warren Campaign.

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Member of the Volunteer Parent Advisory Board, Colorado Parents for Vaccinated Communities-current
Precinct Co-Chair Person, Colorado Precinct 411-current
Board member, Children&#39;s House preschool, 2016-2017
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a member of the Parent Advisory Board of Colorado Parents for Vaccinated Communities (CPVC), I  represent the interests of Colorado parents who believe that public health legislation should be based on science and evidence based studies. The board served as a voice for these parents as Colorado&#39;s legislators, led by Rep. Mullica, drafted immunization bills, most recently the successfully passed SB 163, which strengthens the requirements for requesting personal belief exemptions to vaccines for school enrollment. In this role, along with other CPVC members, I also testified on behalf of parents who favored this bill during the public comment committee hearings for it in addition to taking part in our wider engagement efforts of contacting legislators via phone calls, emails and in-person. 
I also organized a Facebook group for Democrats living in East Boulder County and used this platform to share information about voting, activism opportunities and other relevant election information this year.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Since moving to Colorado in 2016, I have deeply appreciated how easy it is to be politically involved in this state. Local legislators are widely available to constituents, public committee hearings are widely accessible and it has by far the best voting system in the country. The approval of Amendments Y and Z establishing the congressional and legislative redistricting committees is yet another example of Colorado engaging the power of its citizens in the political process. Fair redistricting is a bedrock of our democracy. Having lived for many years in North Carolina and witnessing the impacts of political gerrymandering, I have come to understand that it is crucial that this process is implemented in such a way that the voices of each district resident are fairly represented. An independent commission whose members are chosen from the state&#39;s populace is a fair and transparent way to ensure that Colorado citizen&#39;s get fair representation. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to help ensure that Colorado&#39;s redistricting maps accurately reflect our current demographics. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my professional life, as well as graduate school, I had the opportunity to work with people from all over the world. This experience allowed me to develop cultural sensitivity, awareness, and the ability to work effectively with people of different backgrounds. The political climate over the last few years, and particularly this election cycle, has unfortunately highlighted the polarization both in Colorado and the US. Working with the No On 115 campaign, I encountered voters with very different views on abortion, but happily connected with some with whom I was able to have patient, civil debate. The population of Colorado has also diversified in recent years, which is increasingly impacting our political make-up. I believe the structure of the commission is well designed to bring together voters from different backgrounds to discuss the most effective and fairest ways to re-draw our electoral maps. I would ask questions of all members/advisors to fully understand any issues from all angles and help to guide the decision-making process in a fair, informed and impartial manner.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
It is important to me that decisions are well-informed. In looking at redistricting, it is critical to understand the current make-up of the district&#39;s population, how it has been historically represented and what changes may need to be made and why. To do this, relevant stakeholders must be consulted, and thorough analysis of the impacts of any changes to be made must be conducted. As a committee member, I would want to be connected to the resources that would allow me to make the most informed decisions. In my work with CPVC, I had to learn about the nuance of the legislative process and leaned on those more familiar with it to help me understand. In my past work with international students, I had to learn and comprehend stringent visa regulations and to work effectively within those parameters. If selected to be on the Congressional Redistricting Committee, I would pay strict attention to detail and be sure to seek out answers to any questions from the most informed sources.
