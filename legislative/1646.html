I have not been politically active.  As a sitting State Judge and later a part-time Municipal Judge, I was bound by the Colorado Code of Judicial Conduct Cannon 4 and therefore, I did not engage in any political activity.

I have given some campaign contributions, specifically in 2018, I contributed to Beto O&#39;Rourke&#39;s campaign for Senate in Texas on line, through ActBlue and in 2020, I contributed to the Biden Harris campaign, the Flip the Senate campaign, the John Hickenlooper campaign and the Diane Mitsch Bush campaign.  All these contributions were made on line using ActBlue

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
The Colorado Bar Association is a non-profit, voluntary membership association with approximately 18,500 members from all over Colorado.  The presidential leadership positions that I have held are elected positions.  They are volunteer working positions.  Some of my presidential duties with the CBA were: I chaired the Executive Council and the Board of Governors.  These are the governing bodies of the CBA.  I also chaired the Legislative Policy Committee and was an ex officio member of all CBA standing committees.  I set the focus for the year under the CBA&#39;s strategic plan, choosing to focus on two goals of that plan, the goal of engaging the diverse population of lawyers and the statewide population of lawyers with not only an emphasis on engaging but also on serving them and the goal of better utilizing new and you attorneys by integrating them throughout the CBA with an emphasis on engaging and serving the new and young attorneys.  I toured the State visiting Local Bar Associations.  I attended various Banquets and Awards Ceremonies, I wrote and/or oversaw the writing of Presidential Messages for The Colorado Lawyer.  I spoke on behalf of the CBA at numerous speaking engagements.  I worked closely with the Executive Director and the staff of CBA.  I worked with Local Bar Associations to insure a policy of inclusivity with all members.
The Pueblo Historical Ghost Walk is an all volunteer fund raising event.  This fund raising event benefits the Pueblo Domestic Violence Community Task Force.  The profits are primarily used for education and training on the handling and prevention of domestic violence matters, and assistance to victims in the form of providing temporary shelter.  I founded this fund raiser in 2004 and was the producer of it from 2004 through 2016.  Literally several hundred volunteers are involved annually in putting on the event.  The volunteers are from all walks of life, including doctors, lawyers, judges, probation officers, sheriff&#39;s deputies, police officers, history buffs, foreign exchange students, thespians etc.  As the producer, I defined committees needed to divide the work in a logical manner (production committee, ticket committee, fund raising committee, PR/advertising committee, docent committee, costume committee, storyteller committee, food committee), defined each committees work, chaired the production committee, found committee chairs, found committee members, held regular production committee meetings, I even wrote and/or edited press releases, fund raising materials, thank you letters, programs and story scripts.  In other words, It was my job to coordinate the event and the fund raising effort , to get all the various committees to work together.  to insure the committees got their work done and to work toward a common goal.
This event combined my passions for theatre and history.  I am proud to say that this event grew to the point of attracting over 2000 walkers a year and raising over $32,900.00, while incurring expenses of approximately $5,200.00 and netting over $27,700.00 to be used in efforts to fulfill the Mission of the Pueblo Domestic Violence Community Task Force.
The Pueblo Domestic Violence Community Task Force&#39;s Mission Statement is &quot;To educate the public, refer victims and families to community resources and reduce the impact of domestic violence in the community&quot;.  Member Agencies include: 10th Judicial Probation Department, ACOVA, YWCA family crisis shelter, Pueblo Rape Crisis Services, CASA of Pueblo, Pueblo County Sheriff&#39;s Office, Colorado Legal Services, Pueblo Police Department, Pueblo Child Advocacy Center, 10th Judicial District Attorney&#39;s Office and community representative and advocates.
With regard to the other organizations listed above, I have held leadership/officer positions with: P.E.O. Chapter BT (President for 2 years), the Diocese of Pueblo Review Board (current chairman.  The board is comprised of the Bishop, clergy and laity), Pueblo Domestic Violence Community Task Force (Treasurer).  I am a member of the Pueblo County Bar Association, a member of Pueblo Rotary Club #43 and a community member of the Colorado State University of Pueblo Internal Review Board.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe the Legislative Redistricting Commission&#39;s work is of utmost importance to the people of the State of Colorado.  This is a newly forming commission based on the voters approval of a ballot issue in 2018.  The concept of using a commission comprised of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans to accomplish redistricting after the new census is an innovative and exciting approach to redistricting.  I desire to play a role in getting this work off to a good start.  I believe this work will be interesting and challenging.  I enjoy a good challenge.  
I believe it is important for the commission to have commissioners that understand the Rule of Law .  As a citizen, lawyer and judge, I believe I have this understanding and I believe in the importance of the Rule of Law and the importance of service.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Consensus is my preferred leadership style when working with an organization.  Obviously, consensus is not a part of judicial decision making.  As a judge and as a leader of various organization, I have always believed that it is important that all parties feel that they have a voice, that they are heard and that they are respected.  When working with others, it is always important to do so with civility and respect.  I have found that even if a decision doesn&#39;t go the way an individual wants, that the decision is more likely to be accepted with a level of understanding and grace when the individual feels they were heard and respected.  This goes a long way toward people feeling that the decision was fair.
I work well with people from all backgrounds.  I have good communications skills which include being a good listener and a good speaker - I have learned communication techniques including stating my understanding of an argument or discussion but then asking for feedback of whether my understanding of what was said is correct.  This helps prevent misunderstanding.  My undergrad degree is in Communications and Theatre.  I have taken many communication theory classes in my lifetime.  I have completed mediation training and diversity and inclusivity training.
I believe I am a known when it comes to being fair and impartial as this is a requirement of a good judge.  I went through 4 election year judicial performance reviews - 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010.  I was recommended for retention all 4 times.  These review are all still available for viewing.  Some of my strengths recognized in all these evaluations were my demeanor, my treatment of people, and my ability to follow the law. One of the biggest flaws identified in these review was that I wasn&#39;t always punctual, a flaw that I have worked hard to overcome  Since my retirement, I have a good history of being on time.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
The very work of being a Judge requires listening to or reading arguments, assessing evidence, applying the law to the established facts and reaching a conclusion, thus I haven many years of work history that required me to exhibit, use and refine my analytical skills.  As an aside, I also have good math skill.
