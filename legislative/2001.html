<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Since moving to Colorado in 2001, I have worked in various groups for the improvement of lives across Colorado.  I am in the private sector, so I usually focus on partnerships between the business community and the rest of the community.  This started with my general education of state-wide issues with &quot;50 for Colorado&quot;, an introduction to communities and service organized by the University of Colorado.  I then spent significant time with the Mile High United Way, both as an organizer and in development of their various programs.  I ultimately joined their Tocqueville Society, a small group of dedicated people aiming to help the many community groups assisted by the United Way.  
I joined the St. Joseph Hospital Foundation Board in 2013.  St. Joe&#39;s is not only the largest private hospital in Denver, but also a leading provider of services on a charitable basis.    I was honored to serve as Chair of the Board from 2017 -2019.  
I worked extensively with the Chamber of Commerce for many years, including being the Board Secretary and Co-Chair of the Legislative Policy Committee.  I was awarded Board Member of the Year&quot; in 2017.  
I worked in the legal community on multiple aid projects and programs.
I was awarded the Patriot Award by the Office of the Secretary of Defense in 2013 for work in support of reservists in the legal community. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have a long history of working across political parties and other constituencies.  Colorado has a proud history of balanced views and pragmatic, but inspiring, visions.  I believe the redistricting commission is among the most important tasks to maintain that integrity for our State.   
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have long focused on consensus, diversity, and inclusion.  As Managing Partner, it was my main job to identify the key goals for the partnership and then unify all our lawyers (up to 900+) behind the goal.   This included implementing our most successful diversity program in the firm&#39;s history.  It also resulted in doubling the firm&#39;s profitability and quadrupling our size.  I undertook a similar role as Chair of the St. Joseph Hospital Foundation.  The foundation had many disparate views and conflicting agendas.  I worked with the Board, the Foundation, and the Hospital to unify behind a single, cohesive plan.  Similarly, working as Co-Chair of the Chamber&#39;s Legislative Policy Committee required a balance of evaluating legislative priorities and, in the end, resulted in a nearly even support and opposition for both Democratic and Republican bills.   The Committee had partisan members, lobbyists and business leaders.  We worked across aisles and through politics to support key initiatives for Denver community.  In the end, our support of various laws (or opposition to laws) was nearly equally split between Democratic and Republican efforts.  It was an amazing education on the positive views, as well as different views, for each party&#39;s ideology.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have spent over 25 years focused on analytical problem solving.  After studying political philosophy in college, I attended law school to further strengthen and support an orderly and analytical mental framework.  Since that time, as a litigation partner and Managing Partner, my entire career has been focused on breaking down issues to address each component logically.  
More then anything, logical reasoning helps bring people together by identifying the root of disagreement.  This is essentially the art of successful lawyers:  identifying the issue, understanding the rule of law that may apply, finding the guiding principles for resolution, and then applying the lessons to the issue at hand.  

Similarly, this was my primary skill set in law firm leadership.  Lawyers are, as a group, educated and skilled at finding problems.  As such, I knew that anything less than pragmatic and logical reasoning would inevitably fail to convince or motivate the lawyers.  Conversely, a transparent, logical, and openly pursued system was easy for everyone to understand and propel.
