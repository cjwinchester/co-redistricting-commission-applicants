</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
     I have served on over twenty organizations in Colorado.  I have been the Chair or Vice Chair of the Board of Trustees on ten of them.  In those roles I have overseen campaigns, presented to various constituencies, and sold projects to different audiences.
     As an example, when the Colorado Springs Health Foundation was created with funds the city received from leasing Memorial Hospital to University of Colorado Health I was the first Chair of the Board of Trustees.  In that role I presented and successfully negotiated with the Mayor and City Council the approval of our by-laws, mission and vision statements, investment policy statement,  hiring of our CEO, and a variety of other issues.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
     I want to serve on the Commission because I love my community and my state.  I want to use my experience and my knowledge 
 to hopefully improve our voting process.   I have long felt our system of establishing voting districts is flawed.  It produces gerrymandered &quot;safe&quot; districts where the primaries become the most important elections pushing candidates into extreme positions.
     Mapping out voting districts is certainly not my field of expertise.  But if appointed I would bring my analytical skills and community expertise to work with the other Commissioners to create districts that are fair and logical.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
     I have led numerous strategic planning efforts for both non-profit and for profit organizations.  I was successful in bringing multiple people with multiple points of view together to reach a consensus plan.  
     As an example I worked on Goodwill of Colorado Springs&#39; first comprehensive marketing plan.   I led this effort and worked with staff and board who had a variety of opinions.  Ultimately I helped navigate a consensus and the plan received the &quot;Highest Commendation&quot; from the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF).





</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
     Most of my career was spent in the direct marketing field.  This is a business that relies heavily on statistical and computer analysis.  Demographic/psychographic data, standard deviation, regression analysis, and basic statistics are used virtually everyday.  Additionally as the CEO of three businesses I was regularly analyzing financial statements, projections, budgets and acquisition possibilities.
     Applying logic differs from analytics.  It is using analysis but taking it to the next level.  An example would be a number of acquisitions I was involved in analyzing.  Often the numbers looked good but we would pass on the opportunity because we didn&#39;t see a culture fit, or were not comfortable with the companies growth prospects.  These were logical reasonable decisions not necessarily based on pure analytics.
