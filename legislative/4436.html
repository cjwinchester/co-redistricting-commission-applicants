</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Immediate past President Apartment Association of Metropolitan Denver, Chairman and seat on the Douglas County Planning Commission 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I am a Colorado native that has a vested interest in state and local government. Graduating from East High School in Denver I was part of the desegregation plan in  the Denver Public Schools during the 1970s. This experience broadened my social awareness as we built a city championship wrestling team with individuals of all races and economic backgrounds. My employment experience has taken me to all parts of the state of Colorado as well as every major market in the western United States. I have traveled extensively and worked closely with city governments in Kansas City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix,  Portland, Reno, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and Seattle. Working closely with individuals who live in those locations , I developed insight into local issues and the challenges of urban growth in each location. My work on the Planning Commission and Apartment Association allowed me to organize and advocate for many issues ranging from employee recruiting, to local signage ordinances, to urban growth patterns, to COVID response protocol. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have always given back to my community whether as a Little League baseball coach or Planning Commissioner, or serving on the Board for the Apartment Association. My work experience has provided a broad background and unique perspective of local and regional issues. In the completion of my civic duties I have organized diverse groups of people building consensus within different organizations and associations.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Several years ago I had the opportunity to attend a luncheon with a prominent local United States Congressman. We discussed and agreed on many issues concerning local real estate even though we were from different political parties. A statement was made that one had best be a registered Democrat if you wanted to be involved in Denver politics and a registered Republican if you wanted to be involved in Douglas County. Party affiliation does not mean that we can not be broad minded and agree on many issues. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Serving as a Planning Commissioner or on the Board of the Apartment Association or my affiliation with the National Apartment Association, I have worked with large groups of people who have diverse viewpoints and competing goals.  For example while working on the Board for the AAMD we successfully applied for a state grant that funded a maintenance apprenticeship program coordinating coursework through the Emily Griffith Opportunity School. We were competing with many other worthy grant requests. We won the grant and the program was quite successful recruiting many entry level candidates to a career path into the apartment management industry. During my work with the Planning Commission , we had to sort through priorities for future zoning and development across Douglas County. Priorities that included many contentious land use proposals. My professional career in real estate management lead me to complete multimillion dollar budgets for the operation of real estate including commercial buildings, retail shopping centers, multifamily apartment buildings, and mini warehouse storage facilities in cities across the western United States. The challenge or problem was to increase property value by increasing net operating income. This was accomplished by creating a successful operating strategy through the budget.
