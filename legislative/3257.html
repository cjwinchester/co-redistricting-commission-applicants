<h5>Occupation</h5>

</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a Bachelor of Arts from Metropolitan State University in Journalism with a Marketing emphasis. I minored in History with an emphasis on the American West and 20th C. European politics. I have a Technical Writing certificate from California State University. Through my religious organization,(Mountain Ancestors Grove, a member grove of Ár nDraíocht Féin, an earth centered religion) I have had inclusivity training, including classes in anti-racism, decolonialization, homophobia, transphobia and conflict resolution. I helped design workshops and seminars about these subjects. My record of employment included being a maid for over 20+ years, once I graduated from MSU, I have worked as an event planner, PR writer, layout editor for church magazine, memoir editor, romance editor and genre writer. I lived in Colorado for a few years in the late 80&#39;s-early 90s, then moved back in 06 to be closer to relatives. I have studied some of the environmental and political issues in Colorado, including, but not limited to, the effects of climate change on wildfire and the effects TABOR and the Gallagher Amendment have on the Colorado state budget.

</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80021
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated to Act Blue 2-2017 to 7-2019
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I was a Mountain Ancestors Grove, ADF board member. I joined in 2014 and resigned in 2017. I helped promote wider inclusion of Black, POC and disabled members. I helped organize donations to Dakota Access Pipeline protests.

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My experience in organizing is making resources available to help people on the ground. I donate a quarter of my income to artists, journalists, bail funds, food banks, LGBTQIA+ causes and domestic violence shelters. I am a queer, disabled woman and I try to represent those communities with humility.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on this commission because I believe it is my civic duty and responsibility. I voted for this. I wanted there to be some sort of oversight to avoid the kind of gerrymandering that happens in other states. When I read in the Colorado Sun that the commission I voted for was having difficulty finding people that would represent Colorado&#39;s diversity, I felt like it would be hypocritical for me not to apply, as I can make the time available that this very important commission needs.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In conflict resolution training, the key to being successful is understanding what the people think the conflict is. That means my first response to any situation is to listen and ask: Do they have any common ground? If they have common ground, then is there a solution that straddles that? If they don&#39;t have common ground, then can I point out some from what they have said? Then, is that common ground enough to build on? Can I help them make it firmer? If I think and feel and examined all the evidence points to the best decision for the most people, then that&#39;s the one I will make. Regarding fairness and impartiality: I will in good faith listen to the concerns of others, examine their sources and try to find a solution that is good for as many people as possible. I think that is fair. Impartiality is another matter. I am not impartial. I don&#39;t believe anyone is impartial because districting/redistricting affects everyone in the state. But I don&#39;t have a conflict of interest and I want solutions to be equitable for everyone involved.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have a Technical Writing certification, so I have an understanding of picking apart a problem and communicating the important parts of it effectively to different audiences. Similarly, my journalism background emphasizes the ability to analyze complex situations and understand which parts are important.
