<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Advocacy for a racial, religious, gender-related group 
In the Fall of 2019, I participated in Shorter AME’s Race Talk University. This was a 10 week program with diverse participants from the Denver Metro Area interested in learning how to effectively advocate for race-equity and disrupt oppressive systems. Since graduating from the program, I’ve taken what I’ve learned to the institutions in which I participate in a few ways. As a graduate student in the School of Public Affairs, I advocated for the inclusion of student voices on the Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion Committee. Through this, I established a diverse cabinet of student leaders who are pursuing a DEI grant to launch an equity audit task force within the school. All of this work balanced the importance of the analysis of data with the necessity of personal identity awareness and relational empathy. As an advocate, I also work to remain aware of my presence. I reflect on how often I’m speaking versus staying silent, as well as when I advocate what is the purpose of my voice in particular spaces. This is a deeply personal and reflective process.
Positions of leadership outside of professional work 
Since December 2018, I’ve served a leadership role with Equity Network United for Metro Denver (ENUF). We are an organizing group that works to end oppressive practices in Denver Public Schools. From a systems perspective, this requires that we organize with students, teachers, parents, school leaders, and executive/elected leaders in the district. Coordinating with individuals across these multiple issue arenas reinforces the importance of managing bias and listening to understand. Because our organizing campaigns involved analysis of quantitative behavioral data as well as conversations with individuals with varying experience of upholding or experiencing oppressive school practices, this work is an exercise in combining data analysis with lived experience.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My leading priority as a member of this commission is to ensure that fair maps exist for Colorado voters. Fair maps are important for our state and every community in Colorado because they ensure not only the ‘one person, one vote’ philosophy of democracy, but they also allow for communities to operate cooperatively within districts. When districts are drawn to be geographically and demographically disparate, there is greater pressure for individuals to adopt a competitive rather than cooperative mindset with fellow citizens. As a community organizer, I’ve seen how often competition hinders progress. I hope that the districts we establish for our state and communities allow for authentic cooperation among neighbors. I believe that as a state, and as a nation, we have so much more in common than we realize. At the very least, we have a shared commitment to making our neighborhoods as safe, prosperous and enduring as possible. If given the opportunity to engage in civic and community work through this committee, I will keep these shared values at the front of my mind and work to create cooperative districts that empower Coloradans to be productive in their own democratic processes. In addition to this vision for my work on this committee, I have technical skills in statistical data analysis, a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science and graduate level coursework in urban planning and development.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a rural organizer in 2018, I was often in situations where individuals with different backgrounds and expectations navigated conversations about what was best for their community. Leading folks in these conversations across lines of difference further affirmed my belief that there is more that unites us than divides us. In particular, these conversations were focused on the idea of how to best serve our K-12 students. Time and time again the problems and aspirations lifted in these conversations were centered on hope and investment in the future. I found that if we could enter conversations with respect, we could usually find our way to common ground, and from these shared values we could work together to build consensus that satisfied participants on all sides of an issue. Leading these discussions affirmed my belief in our shared values, and it also strengthened my ability to remain impartial. I practiced separating my role as a facilitator from my personal identity, this allowed me to hold my personal beliefs and values separate from the task at hand. As a commissioner, I’ll again navigate this practice of impartiality, knowing that we go further when we go together.
