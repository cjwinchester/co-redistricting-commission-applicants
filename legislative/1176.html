<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have been a Colorado resident since 1973, and I have traveled throughout the state exploring trails, peaks, campgrounds, hot springs, skiing, biking, driving tours, lakes and rivers.  I have also been driven to explore areas in reading books about Colorado history and how important it is to know how history can shape our present and future. Through all these different lenses I have seen many changes both good and bad.  My jobs, personal projects and volunteer efforts have been focused mostly on customer service and have  involved strong listening and analytical skills to produce a workable solution.  I care very much about contributing to a process that will result in a balanced, healthy, and sustainable Colorado for all its inhabitants and environment.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My work on four non-partisan boards that represent law enforcement, animal welfare, recreation, sports and balancing the needs of the members and their constituents. Through considering a wide range of opinions and balancing the needs and goals of different communities, we were able to achieve one shared goal: partnerships.  Victim Services based out of a law enforcement agency in Eagle County was new and I had to fund my job through a grant at first.  It eventually became a funded position through the Eagle County Sheriff’s Office (ECSO).  I formed partnerships with existing victim advocate groups and worked with other law enforcement agencies to incorporate how each agency could help. The new gymnastics center involved finding land and funding to relocate since the existing space was being used by Eagle River Water &amp; Sanitation District (ERWSD) for a planned expansion.  Discussions involved the Town of Vail, ERWSD, Vail Recreation District (VRD) and Eagle County School District.  New partnerships and funding mechanisms were formed and the facility was built next to Red Sandstone Elementary School in Vail.  This project resulted in the VRD board moving on from this project and learning how to form other new partnerships with Vail Ski &amp; Snowboard Academy and other recreation districts in the valley to share our field spaces for tournaments and training. Since the Vail Valley has limited space for field sports this was essential to keep and grow recreational programs for the entire valley. The new animal shelter was a new partnership with Eagle County Animal Control that was necessary since neither the Eagle County Humane Society or Animal Control could afford to build a shelter without help. These two projects were very successful, and they benefit these communities today.  I have learned through my jobs and volunteer work that different opinions can produce sustainable and productive results.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have a degree in Geography, which has taught me how to analyze the human/environment interaction through past, present and future.  The knowledge I gained from that has influenced my jobs, volunteer work and hobbies since then. My paralegal education helped me to understand legal issues and their applications. Serving on four different Boards of Directors has given me well-rounded experience with a broad range populations and situations.  Being able to consider different points of view and apply to a common goal has been essential for success. All of this has given me skills and experience to adapt and succeed in finding solutions to situations that presented challenges.  The new gymnastics center in Vail is the best example of how I was able to participate as a citizen and then a board member to bring about change and introduce a progressive eight years to Vail’s recreation community.
