</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I have advocated for myself and the interests of people that share my profession, culture, ethics or region. As well as for those who I don’t immediately belong such as the bleeding disorder community, which I joined when I was a teenager because of a close relationship with someone with hemophilia. A recent example of success I have had organizing my community would be solving a storm water drainage issue in my neighborhood. I worked with my neighbors to define the problems causing water to pool in our yards, worked with civil engineers and contractors to develop a solution using chase drains. Then worked stakeholders like my neighbors, the town of Frederick public works, and our metro district to execute that solution while following requirements like permitting, the drainage plan and funding. The metro district then expanded that solution to other drainage issues in our subdivision.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
None
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
National Hemophilia Society Colorado Chapter
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve the proud traditions and principles of the us representative democracy, and guarantee my relatively unique viewpoint is represented. Accurate representation which is focused on solving our most pressing concerns as local communities, while advocating for those communities when solving the concerns of broader shared communities is how our representative democracy works most effectively. The only way to achieve that pillar of our us government is to make sure the resulting representatives most accurately represent the opinions of the voters. This needs to hold true whether their opinions are based on profession, age, ethics, ethnicity, faith, culture, interest or any other trait or belief. I want to help find a districting solution that makes sure the biggest stresses of the most Coloradans are the primary concerns of the our representatives while not suppressing the most critical issues of the minority groups. I want to help make sure every unique minority facet of our beautiful state can see themselves reflected in the advocacy of their representatives. More personally, I’m 29 years old with a unique skillset with a background in gis and data communication. I will be impacted by the echoing decisions of the committee for not just the next decade, but also by precedent for censuses to come. Likely though, age wise I will be under represented, particularly considering I am near the minimum age requirement of Colorado General Assembly. Despite my age though I have a wealth of experience and skills in geolocational and data based problem solving which is key in districting. I want to do this because I think I am a rare and valuable view point.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I can reach a consensus for two reasons: Im an political independent use to finding common ground with both parties, and I am good at communicating complex data driven solutions particularly with maps. I believe the most stark differences in our political beliefs is not our political party, despite our representatives voting on party lines the majority of the time. When I talk with my diverse neighbors about how legislation would impact them in a way divorced from party and focused on their family, I find the divisions much more tied to their professions, faith, and interests. When I became an independent, it was to find candidates from both parties that shared my opinions and focus for political issues that impacted me. I think I can convince people from both parties of the real contrasts in our communities rather than focus on party and how best to make every diverse voice be represented. Additionally, I have worked on map and data presentation design to lay out non-partisan intents and draw a solution in a simple and understandable way. I can communicate a data set clearly and prove with reasonable and logical arguments that a solution meets criteria. As well as communicate any potential problems or fallacies and how they were addressed.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have worked for the USGS (DOI), IBM and Maxar (formerly DigitalGlobe) working as a software developer on several missions in a variety of industries aerospace, meteorology, natural disasters, and shipping logistics. All of which involve logic and reasoned problem solving with complex GIS data. I daily: define problems, collect (physical, digital, legal, and financial) requirements, design solutions, communicate those solutions to clients, and implement those solutions. For example, when I worked for the United States Geologic Service a division in the Department of the Interior in college for 5 years; made earthquake risk maps. These maps are provided to first responders within 15 minutes of an earthquake to best make decisions about where victims meed help and what help they will need. I also made earthquake hazard maps for legislators and policy makers to use when designing building codes. I frequently worked with audiences like first responders and government officials to explain natural disaster risk and refine the information I provided to best serve the common goal of keeping people safe in the most extreme disasters.
