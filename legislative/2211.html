<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
 I was employed for 11 years by Colorado State University Extension (CSU Extension), the last 9 of which in the role of County Director.  The mission of CSU Extension is to identify and meet local non-credit educational needs/opportunities. My responsibilities as County Director  included representing, organizing and advocating for broad-reaching community education programs . Community needs were assessed and identified by local Advisory Boards. As County Director, I coordinated with Advisory Boards to engage local resources in supporting the programs offered by CSU Extension. These programs included 4-H Youth Development, Colorado Master Gardener, Colorado Building Farmers program, SNAP education, etc.  Many CSU Extension programs are volunteer based. I lead efforts in volunteer recruitment, training and program evaluation.  Critical to program success was engaging community members such as non-profit organizations, schools, parents, business owners, city, county and state agencies and citizen volunteers. I have experience engaging these groups , presenting to community groups, and gathering their input. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
No political activity other then voting.  No donations to campaigns or political organizations that I can recall.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
AARP. YMCA. Rescued Hearts ( local non-profit that raises funds to support animal rescue groups.) , KRCC pubic radio. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I feel that the work this committee will do is very relevant and significantly important for years to come. I voted in favor of utilizing the citizen based process to redistrict. As a retired person, I have the time, energy and interest to support this process.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a CSU Extension and U of IL Extension employee, I received training in communication skills, listening skills, building consensus and diversity awareness. I have experience working with community groups to build consensus around local educational needs.  As a state employee, it was my responsibility to have communities determine their own needs, not to impose state/federal agency programming upon them.  To promote community wide agreement, I would make a strong effort to have representation from all relevant sectors of the community at the table, and enable all voices to be heard in a non-threatening environment.  Quieter voices sometimes need elevation, while louder voices sometimes need moderation to bring balance to a discussion.  Being impartial means setting aside my pre-conceived notions/interests and promoting decision making by the group. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My academic training in science focused on fact based information gathering and the scientific method. As part of this methodology, situations are viewed from several perspectives, considering many possibilities before reaching a conclusion. Professional development at CSU Extension included personality assessments to determine our strengths. On these assessments I scored highest in traits relating to logic, reason and analytical skills. Colleagues describe me as a creative, resourceful person. These traits help me to see things others sometimes do not.
