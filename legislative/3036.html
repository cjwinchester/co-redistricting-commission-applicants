<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Donations: John James (Senate/Michigan 2020),  Lindsey Graham (Senate S Carolina 2020), Ted Cruz (President 2016), may be others that I cannot remember
I have been a registered Republican and conservative since the age of 18 (one could argue well before then, though I was not able to vote). I served as a Colorado Delegate in the 2016 Caucus for Ted Cruz. In 34 years, I have only missed voting 2-3 times during odd year votes (never Presidential or HOR/Senate). I take my right to vote seriously and believe all Americans should. I am an avid reader of political data and information and I try my very best to be well-informed on the issues of our day. I believe elections should be fair and competitive, as it is best for our democracy.

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
D&#39;Evelyn Jr/Sr High School Steering Committee (governing board)
D&#39;Evelyn Jr/Sr High School Accountability Committee

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As Chair on the Steering Committee of my children&#39;s school for 4 out of the 7 years I have served, making tough and unpopular decisions was frequent and just a normal part of the job. It was essential to work with all stakeholder groups to come to the best decision for the school, all the while making sure we were consistent with our Founding Document. Listening to the lens of various stakeholders was important, but having the gumption to make the final decisions was really where the rubber hit the road, as most decisions did not please all parties. Not allowing the distraction of not pleasing everyone to paralyze is imperative to getting the good work done that is needed.

As Chair, I had to supply the background information, initiate surveys to our stakeholders, and report on that data so the team could come to an informed decision. Additional research was frequently needed and an inordinate amount of time was spent to be sure no stone was left unturned so a data-based decision (rather than an emotionally-based one) was come to. As Chair, my volunteer hours frequently exceeded 40 hours per month (my term will end in the Spring of 2021).

As a member of the governing board, I also had to serve on multiple other committees including:
Curriculum committees: where curriculum decisions were made that had to be in line with our Founding Document while taking into consideration research, as well as teacher and student needs.
Textbook committees: where it was essential to not only meet our Founding Document objectives but also ensure there was no political bias in our textbook choices and that the textbooks would meet the needs of teachers and students.
Hiring committees: where it was imperative that chosen candidates met philosophical alignment with our Founding Document, as well as had the skill set needed to inspire our students to learn.
Principal hiring committee: in 2018, I was in charge of a national search for and hiring of our principal. I headed up every single aspect of this committee and ended with a committee of 12 members who unanimously agreed to our final choice in principal. This process included staff, parents, and students. With many competing viewpoints and needs, leading the team to a consensus decision was an enormous feat.  

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe proper districting is essential to upholding our democracy and ensuring all voices can be heard. If districting is done unfairly, it stifles people&#39;s ability to make a difference in election outcomes. Fair and honest elections are at the core of our democracy and I want to be a part of ensuring Colorado meets this objective.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am a data-driven individual that uses facts to come to conclusions. That being said, not all input is factual. Communities and their members&#39; thoughts on issues matter and should be considered when important choices need to be made. Coming to the table open without a pre-determined decision and listening to hear the basis for disagreement and finding common ground is the beginning of establishing consensus among parties. Those points must then be weighed in light of the goals of the committee and then the difficult decisions need to be made. In addition to my governing board work, I have negotiated 2 very complex divorces for family members. Their ex-spouses trusted me to be fair and impartial, in spite of my relation to their spouse, and both situations brought resolution without tens of thousands of dollars of attorney&#39;s fees or any further resentment that usually comes from legal battles. I was sought out by these parties, as I am known for mediating and finding common ground and consensus when it is difficult to obtain.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am used to working with tremendous amounts of data, both in my profession and volunteer work. The first and most important part of data analysis is making sure your data input is dependable. Once you are sure of this fact, you must then break down the data without assumptions. Sometimes a first glance tells one story when a deeper dive tells an entirely different one. The best example I can give for this is how I analyze and determine a biological parent for an adoptee. You start without a name of the bio parent and only have a list of DNA cousins that match that adoptee. You must then find the in common cousins to narrow down which line the adoptee is from. Sometimes endogamy (close relatives marrying within a line) will make it appear a cousin is closer than they are, leading you to an incorrect conclusion. Without fully researching each line, this would be missed. You must build complex family trees and take a deep dive into each line to be 100% sure your answer is correct. On occasion, a totally different outcome is found. As an example, someone who should have been the 1/2 sibling of an adoptee found out during my research that the person they thought was their father, was in fact, not their biological father. Going in with an open mind and allowing the data to speak to you while taking none of it just at face value and leaving room for surprises, allows one to really get the most out of the data that is available. Putting in the time and energy necessary is imperative to come to a conclusion you can count on.
