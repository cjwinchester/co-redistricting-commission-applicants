<h5>Occupation</h5>

  For the past 26 years I have worked as a full-time real estate agent. Since 2001 I have been employed by Celebration Real Estate Corporation, an S-Corp with just one shareholder—me. I work under the umbrella of RE/MAX Advanced, Inc. in Fort Collins.

In my business I almost always work as an advocate for my clients. I consider their interests above all others. As a result, advocacy is second nature for me.

I am very pleased and honored to have been awarded Fort Collins REALTOR of the Year in 2006. This award is not based on sales (although one must be active in the business to be considered). Instead, the past REALTORS of the Year select whomever they believe best represents the highest ideals of professionalism and service to the REALTOR organization and our community. I am deeply honored that the best in the business consider me their peer.

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Two experiences illustrate particularly well my abilities in organizing, representing, advocating for, and considering interests. The first is when I lead the Poudre Schools District Accountability Committee review of the first charter school application in Fort Collins. The second is successfully leading my homeowners’ association in changing the neighborhood covenants.

As an unpaid volunteer, I was an active participant in the Poudre Schools District Accountability Committee when the first charter school application was submitted. At the time, charter schools were a political hot potato. Following state law, it fell to the District Accountability Committee to review the application and consider the interests of the applicant, the school district, and the community as a whole. I volunteered to head the review subcommittee and organized four other subcommittee members. Under my leadership, the subcommittee created a fair and impartial process by first identifying 28 application requirements specified by state law and the school district. The subcommittee then painstakingly reviewed the application against these standards and evaluated whether required information was provided, whether it was sufficiently detailed, and whether the applicant&#39;s proposal for each requirement was acceptable. Finally, I represented the subcommittee by presenting to the entire District Accountability Committee and to the school board our findings regarding the merits and deficiencies of the application.

The subcommittee did a masterful job and, as a result, everybody was angered. The pro-charter people were upset because we did not unquestionably accept the application. The anti-charter people were upset that we did not flatly deny the application. These reactions are evidence of our impartiality. 

And the subcommittee? We had more than consensus. We were unanimous in our findings. By focusing on the standards set by law and first developing a fair and impartial process for review of the application against the standards, the subcommittee was able to stay above the political fray.

In the end, the applicant was able to address deficiencies in the application and the charter school was approved. Since then other charter schools have come and gone in Fort Collins but this school remains strong and successful. I truly believe our subcommittee deserves some credit for that. I am proud of my efforts in organizing the subcommittee, representing the subcommittee before the school board, advocating for the subcommittee’s recommendations, and considering the interests of the various stakeholder groups.

I envision a similar process for the redistricting commission. This effort has the potential to be politically destabilizing for some entrenched interests. After all, if the commission does its job well, some currently uncompetitive districts will made competitive... and some people are not going to like that. I believe if redistricting commission focuses on the standards set by law and develops and follows a fair and impartial process around those standards, it will be successful in achieving its mission.

More recently, as an active participant in my homeowners’ association, I served on the Board of Directors when it sought to make a covenant change. Want to take on a challenge? Volunteer for your HOA!

As President for much of this process, I organized most aspects of this effort. I sought to ensure that Board members were thoroughly informed of all available options. With impartially, I insisted that the Board patiently allow anyone to speak and that everyone be heard. In this way the Board was able to consider the interests of all our neighbors. I also stepped aside when others wanted to take a more active leadership role (and then stepped back into leadership when they decided leading really was not that much fun). In this way I was able promote consensus by building trust and creating buy-in.

In the end, the Board reached unanimous agreement on a proposal to present to our homeowners. We were able to achieve consensus among our homeowners with 150 of 175 voting households in favor of the proposal. These numbers are truly amazing--a very high level of neighborhood engagement with 86% of households in agreement!

Per state law, our final step was to obtain court approval of the changes. I represented my HOA in court and advocated on behalf of my neighbors.

Our efforts were successful. Following approval by the court, the covenant changes went into effect. They had an immediate impact on our HOA, greatly strengthening its financial situation. This summer costly repairs were made to the asphalt path through our neighborhood common area. The funds for these repairs were made available because of the changes to our covenants. I am deeply satisfied to see the legacy of my efforts and the positive impact of effectively organizing this project, representing and considering the interests of my neighbors and our neighborhood, and advocating for them.

These experiences give me confidence that I will serve well if selected to serve on this commission.     

</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
For at least the past 15 years I have actively participated as a volunteer for numerous political campaigns, supporting candidates for Fort Collins and Loveland City Council, State House of Representatives, State Senate, and Larimer County offices. In 2011 on my own initiative, I developed a campaign training course for candidates and campaign managers. My current campaign participation is most often as an unpaid strategy and messaging consultant.

My most significant political activity was running for Fort Collins City Council in 2015. This non-partisan race was very competitive. In a district with about 14,000 registered voters, I lost by 140 votes. While I did not care for this outcome, I know in my heart of hearts that the citizens of Fort Collins benefited from a competitive race.

I have first-hand experience and a perspective shared by few others--that of a candidate--about what makes a race competitive and the benefits enjoyed by our communities from competitive races. This fuels my motivation to serve and partly explains my strong support for the mission of the redistricting commission. My experience and perspective uniquely qualify me to serve, having provided me with relevant analytical skills.

Since November 10, 2015, I have donated money to: Vote for Eric Kronwall Committee, REALTOR Political Action Committee, Vote Nate Budd Committee, Larimer County Republican Party, Irene Josey for Treasurer Committee, Sean (Dougherty) for Larimer County Committee, National Republican Senatorial Committee, Elect Noah (Hutchison) Committee, Elect Emily (Gorgol) Committee, Wade Troxell Mayoral Committee, Aislinn (Kottwitz) for Larimer Committee, Cory Gardner for Senate Committee. In addition, a portion of my annual Colorado Association of REALTORS and National Association of REALTORS dues are used for political purposes.

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Since November 10, 2015, I have been a member of and actively participated in: Toastmasters, Timberline Church, Four Seasons Master Homeowners Association, North Fort Collins Business Association, Fort Collins Board of REALTORS, Colorado Association of REALTORS, National Association of REALTORS, and Council of Residential Specialists. My uninterrupted participation in all these organizations began prior to 2015.

In 2015 I was recognized as the Fort Collins Board of REALTOR Housing Hero for my affordable housing advocacy.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on this commission for three reasons.

First, I strongly support the mission of this commission. I know from personal experience that competitive districts benefit our communities. I seek to help the commission fulfill its mission.

Second, I am uniquely qualified to serve on this commission. All of my experiences seem to be pointing to this particular opportunity. In other contexts, I have put into practice the skills and abilities called for—organizing, representing, advocating for, and considering interests. I have a proven track record of fairly and impartially creating agreement and promoting consensus. My experiences campaigning and as a candidate have provided me with analytical skills that are particularly relevant for this effort.

Third, I desire to leave a legacy. If this commission does its job well, its impact will be no less than 10 years, the period until the next census. I believe, though, that the commission’s legacy could be much longer. The precedents set and procedures put into place are likely (with tweaks) to be used by future commissions. The echoes may be generational. In addition, Colorado is a leader in the nation in the use of citizen-based independent redistricting commissions. We may be able to show the rest of the country how to be successful in putting an end to partisan gerrymandering. I want to be a part of this legacy. 

I am applying for both the Legislative and Congressional Redistricting Commissions. My preference is to serve on the Legislative Redistricting Commission. However, I would consider it a privilege and honor to serve on either commission.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my discussion of my experience in organizing, representing, advocating for, or considering the interests of groups, organizations, or associations in Colorado, I recount two challenging situations where I promoted consensus, created agreement, and was fair and impartial. Please carefully review that portion of my application.

I am a process person. How we get to an outcome is often just as important as the outcome itself. I have found it is much easier to get to agreement and consensus when processes and procedures are hashed out beforehand. If selected to serve, I will urge my fellow commissioners to first develop processes and procedures for how business and hearings are conducted and how proposed district maps are evaluated relative to legal requirements and competitiveness. 

Building trusting on a one-on-one basis with the other commissioners facilitates agreement and consensus. I have done this in the past by:
&gt; Making and keeping promises,
&gt; Transparency,
&gt; Bending over backwards to elicit and listen to the input of others, and
&gt; Assumption of positive intent.

In addition to creating agreement and promoting consensus, good processes help to assure fairness and impartiality.  

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My two engineering degrees certainly speak to my analytical skills. More importantly, I have relevant analytical skills developed by working on campaigns and being a candidate. I am experienced digging into voter and demographic data to determine precinct and district composition and to assess likely electorate behavior. 

I am a people-oriented analyst. This means that I have the soft skills to work effectively with others while possessing strong logic and reasoning skills.

I have great confidence in my ability to serve well on a redistricting commission. It is my sincere hope that I will have the opportunity to do so.

Respectfully submitted,
Eric Kronwall
