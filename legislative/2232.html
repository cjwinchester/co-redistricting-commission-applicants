</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Independent Consultant- Self employed. 
Please see attached resume for additional information. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  In June 2019, I received my Masters in Public Policy from Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey. 
From June 2008 to June 2009, I served as a Graduate Fellow in Natural Science Education through Colorado State University in partnership with the Gore Range Natural Science School (now Walking Mountains Science Center) in Avon, Colorado. 
In 2007 I received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, where I double-majored in Philosophy and Environmental studies. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81623
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In 2008, I volunteered for the Obama for America presidential campaign. 
In 2010, I worked in Mesa, Delta, Montrose, Ouray, Gunnison and Eagle counties as a Field Organizer for the Colorado Coordinated Campaign, specifically supporting Salazar for Congress and Bennet for Senate. 
In 2012 I worked as Regional Field Director for Obama for America-Colorado, covering Routt, Grand, Summit, Eagle, Lake and Gunnison counties. 
In 2016, I volunteered for the Bennet for Colorado campaign. 

Since November 10, 2015, I have donated small quantities to: 
- Foster Campbell for US Senate
- Run for Something
- Kerry Donovan for SD5
- Dylan Roberts for HD26
- Doug Jones for U.S. Senate
- Michael Bennet for America
- Diane Mitsch Bush for Congress

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Unfortunately, my work in the office of Senator Michael Bennet and my time out of state as a graduate student have generally precluded me from most participation in these types of organizations and boards over the past five years. Once the pandemic subsides and my newborn daughter is a bit older, I hope to be an active participant in appointed boards and commissions, and volunteer locally with English in Action. Recently, during my time at Princeton University, I served as Associate Editor for the Journal of Public and International Affairs. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
In my many years working as a US Senate staffer, I served primarily as an advocate for communities across the state. Much of my work consisted of building relationships with elected officials and community leaders, building an understanding of local issues and needs, and then working within the Senator&#39;s office and the federal government to seek solutions to those challenges. My work ranged across many issue areas, from finding consensus on public land management in Northwest Colorado, to supporting the construction of a new hospital in Kremmling, to bringing federal resources to fight the pine beetle infestation, to restructuring a USDA loan for the Town of Red Cliff. All of this work required extensive collaboration with groups of citizens, coalitions of elected officials, business and public interest associations, and nonprofit organizations and boards. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I strongly believe that a fair and impartial redistricting process is essential to a functioning democracy, and fundamental to the idea of &quot;one person, one vote&quot; that underlies our entire political system and ensures fair and equal representation for all. I feel that Colorado&#39;s Independent Redistricting Commissions will be an elegant and effective solution to the gerrymandering that has been used to undermine our democracy by both parties in other states, and I am excited to be a part of ensuring that the Commission is not only an effective and impartial method for addressing this issue in Colorado, but can also serve as a model for the rest of the nation. 

I also feel that my many years of traveling across Colorado, holding public office hours, meeting with leaders and constituents, planning public events and travel for elected officials has given me a deep understanding of many communities, large and small, across the state. I believe that this background and my extensive understanding of the political and cultural geography of our state can be uniquely valuable to a thoughtful and equitable redistricting process. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Building consensus and finding common ground between multiple stakeholders and disparate sides has been fundamental to my professional career on the Western Slope. Most of my projects in Senator Bennet&#39;s office involved identifying and building coalitions to support middle-ground solutions to issues such as fostering oil and gas development on the Roan Plateau, or encouraging wildfire mitigation in sensitive watersheds. This work requires deep and careful listening, and the ability to truly acknowledge and recognize multiple perspectives while also identifying the shared values between them. I believe that my experience in finding consensus amidst a broad spectrum of perspectives - while also acknowledging and respecting differences - can be valuable to the complex process of redistricting. The success of these Commissions will depend, in part, on their ability to acknowledge, respect, and balance the full spectrum of Colorado&#39;s communities and their unique sets of values and interests. This tiers closely to my professional experience working in many of these same communities, which would allow me to help foster and encourage this same sense of collaboration amongst my fellow Commissioners. I also feel that my extensive work as a public servant and advocate for the needs of communities, regardless of their politics, has proven my ability to work as a fair and impartial advocate for all Coloradans. 


</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My career has required me to build experience in analyzing competing policy arguments, evaluating data, and incorporating information from issue experts. Effective government advocacy and legislative work requires the ability to objectively analyze a situation, understand the factors at play, and recognize how a structural change could affect it. These must be balanced with a realistic, measured understanding of the available and relevant policy and advocacy tools. I&#39;m confident that my record of successful legislative development and community advocacy has proven my effectiveness in this sort of measured, real-world problem solving. 

In 2018, I sought my Masters degree specifically to build on this experience, particularly by improving my skills in data analysis and building a background in the history and theory of US government and policymaking. Much of my coursework was relevant to the redistricting process, including classes in GIS-based data mapping and analysis, policymaking in diverse societies, program and policy evaluation, and theories of governance.
