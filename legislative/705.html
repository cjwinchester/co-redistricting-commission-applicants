  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  President Colorado Mesa University
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>

</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
During my long tenure in higher education I have worked with other Colorado colleges and universities and their constituencies to support a common and consensus approach to budget formulas and requests.  
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
FIre and Police ballot issue, Grand Junction bed tax for tourism
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Grand Junction Economic Development Partnership, Grand Valley Lacrosse, 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My observation is that as either party has been successful in packing the opposite party into ultrasafe districts with safe districts for their party this has intensified the partisan divide.  Competitive districts result in legislators more willing to compromise and find common ground.  
I’ve made public service my life’s work and I view this opportunity as a meaningful way to continue serving my community and State.   I have spent my entire professional life advocating for an equal seat at the table for Western Colorado and I believe I will bring a great deal of knowledge, perspective and a proven record of consensus building to the Commission.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
For seventeen years, I have served as President of Colorado Mesa University (CMU), reporting to a politically diverse Board of Trustees.  In addition to facilitating and building consensus among our governing board, I have also worked diligently to build bi-partisan consensus around major policy initiatives at the Colorado General Assembly.  I’m fond of saying that higher education is not a partisan issue and I believe my reputation among elected Republicans and Democrats across Colorado backs this up.  On point is the reality that at the end of my legislative career the good friends I made were spread across both caucuses. This work is best done utilizing active listening techniques and identifying areas of agreement among parties.  During my tenure at CMU, we have tripled the size of campus, doubled student enrollment and dramatically turned around the financial health of the organization.  This work would not have been possible without building consensus, elevating compromise and keeping a laser-like focus on what’s best for students.  Further, I believe my record demonstrates a strong ability to use data to inform decision making rather than emotion or political whims.  On any given day, I can be accused of being “too liberal” or “too conservative” in executing my duties as President of CMU.   If chosen to serve in this capacity, I believe my demonstrated ability to develop consensus in a fair and impartial way will be a strong asset for the Commission and the State of Colorado.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
While trained as an attorney, I believe my true education came in the form of growing up in western Colorado and securing a strong liberal arts education.  In my current professional role, navigating the complex world of higher education finance, student services, fundraising, academic affairs, legal and regulatory affairs, legislative engagement and even collegiate athletics requires a tremendous ability to quickly process data, information and feedback from multiple stakeholders.  My ability to make dozens of data-driven decisions each and every day comes from a clear sense of purpose, an understanding of our institutions’ role and mission, and a personal ethos centered on doing right by my neighbors.  As my team will attest, I insist on good data and am no stranger to long spreadsheets, reams of analysis and even flipping through statute books.  Having learned at the feet of Colorado political giants – both Democrats and Republicans – over the past forty years, I fully understand the way to apply logic and reason to public policy questions and I would welcome the opportunity to bring my skillset to bear in this capacity.
