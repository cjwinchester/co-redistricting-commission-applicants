</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Political activity is just county level: I&#39;ve served as a precinct delegate to the County Republican Party Assembly and also served as an alternate to the State Assembly, but was never needed.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I volunteer heavily through local 4-H and FFA in our county. I currently serve on the advisory board for Otis High School FFA chapter. I also served a short term on the Yuma District Hospital Advisory Board. I served for many years on the livestock committee for our local fair and also was in charge of the catch-it program within our fair. I am currently serving on my church council board as an evangelism chair. and I coordinate a huge fall festival each and every year that is 100% free to any and all participants, I plan a chili cook-off each year and we generally honor and recognize certain entities within our community; such as healthcare workers, EMT&#39;s. I belong to our local Washington County Cattlewomen&#39;s group as well as the state Cattlewomen organization. We pay dues to the National Cattlemen&#39;s Beef Association, Colorado Corn Growers and to the Colorado Farm Bureau.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I was a 4-H leader for many years in Washington County. Organizing is extremely important for the success of a club and when I first took on the head leader for our club, we had just under $5.00 to our club name. I learned many organizing duties while building some equity into our club. When I turned the club over to a new leader around 15 years later, that club had over $2,000.00 in its checking and nearly $6,000.00 in the savings account. I&#39;m a strong advocate for youth programs. I&#39;ve reached out to the community several times to find statistics and truths for issues at hand. One season our local fairboard wanted to try a new method to picking the kids that could sell in the livestock sale at the county fair. I went into the trial season with an open mind but afterwards I did not feel that this was a positive change for our county youth. The fairboard voted to make the change to use this system and I researched many reasons why it was not a viable option for our county. I worked with extension and prepared a booklet stating why this was not favorable and presented it to our Board of County Commissioners, which they overturned it. That&#39;s how a government entity should work. I also advocated for a young girl in our county that was misrepresented by an adult panel over her duties. I found a lawyer that would fight for her and that lawyer did everything pro bono. I coordinate a huge fall festival, through my church, each and every year that is 100% free to any and all community members, I plan a chili cook-off each year, also providing a free chili meal to the community while generally honoring and recognizing certain entities within our community; such as healthcare workers, EMT&#39;s, local police departments and state patrol offices, teachers, electrical workers, volunteer fire departments , and so on. I belong to our local Washington County Cattlewomen&#39;s group as well as the state Cattlewomen organization. We pay dues to the National Cattlemen&#39;s Beef Association, Colorado Corn Growers and to the Colorado Farm Bureau. During this Covid pandemic our Cattlewomen&#39;s group had a donation of over 3,000 pounds of frozen ground beef. We coordinated pull through sites for people to come and get their free ground beef, then we hand delivered to people that could not leave their homes, using gloves and masks that we changed each and every time, between houses. I also coordinate a teacher appreciation breakfast burritos and juice to our local county teachers in a couple of school districts. I love to volunteer and I love the youth especially.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The reason that I would like to serve on the commission is that I care deeply about the state of Colorado. I enjoy the political aspects of how our state and country is ran. I feel like anytime I can help in a public policy matter then I should try and do that. I have a very broad range of interaction with all types of people and demographics, and I love to work with people. I really love people. We have a very busy and successful family farm/ranch business and I believe that it has given me the opportunity to work with many different ideas to come to an agreement. I love public policy and I&#39;m a feet on the ground kind of person. I also believe in being honest and fair, in all things. I like to serve in my community because good government should care about all people. The land that my family farms is very important to me and I would like to do my part to keep that land in the hands of private landowners in place of government.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
While my views may be primarily conservative, I do think I possess an ability to look at all avenues and ideas on issues. I like to take different perspectives and ponder on them. I&#39;ve honestly changed many of my own fundamental ideals after much deliberation with myself. I also can stand firm in what I believe, and I also strive to give reason to what my believes are. I feel this makes me a very fair and impartial person to deal with. I always choose kindness in dealing with people. Even if they don&#39;t respond to kindness, it keeps me grounded. I may not be the person to speak up first, but I like to listen and gather all the information first and foremost. Even when my ideas are not met with consideration from others, I learn to absorb and learn from that.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I may struggle in this area of analytical skillsets but I&#39;ll list what I do know: In the realm of farming and ranching our days and work for the days are absolutely never set in stone. We face many issues for our day to day work and it makes me a very flexible person, not as flexible as my husband but nonetheless, flexible. We are a family unit working together, and this can create a mired of issues to deal with. I manage all of our office and bookkeeping duties on my own. While I&#39;d love a certain day or day&#39;s to be set aside for office work, it never happens. I must use my time in a smart manner and do books whenever the opportunity arises. I&#39;m a natural organizer and keep my area highly organized. I never use to like to assume much of anything but I find myself daily trying to make assumptions on where my duties might be; either in a tractor, combine, on horseback, or an ATV, hauling a family member to doctor appointments, among many other guesses. If we do field work then I also prepare food for all workers, my only rule being that if you&#39;d like food for the next day then it&#39;s your responsibility to return your lunch box at the end of the day to me. Sometimes the help is five or seven people and somedays it can be over 20 people. While working alongside them, I still manage to feed everyone a decent and usually a delicious beef meal. I think communication is critical in our business and with any boards that I have served on. I feel that I handle all things thrown at me because I possess a strong sense of ambiguity. I&#39;ve learned through the years, to just roll with the punches.
