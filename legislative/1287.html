        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for KRAIG RYAN HAMIT</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  KRAIG RYAN HAMIT
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Deputy District Attorney with 21st Judicial District District Attorney&#39;s Office
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I graduated from the University of Northern Colorado with a bachelors in political science and a minor in legal studies. I graduated from Creighton University School of Law with a JD and a masters in Government and Leadership. I am licensed to practice law in Colorado. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81505
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I have a lot of experience in advocating for people and some experience in organizing and representing organization. In my time with the District Attorney&#39;s Office, I have had considerable experience advocating and speaking with people from all walks of life. While on the board of the Pro Bono Project we made strides in our representation and advocacy for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. The Grand Valley Ducks Unlimited chapter also gave me experience in organizing a decent-sized fundraiser and having to deal with the transition to a completely online event due top COVID restrictions that was a big success. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have voted in almost all available elections. I was an intern in Representative Cory Gardner&#39;s (CO-4) DC office in the summer of 2012. I have donated to the following political campaigns: Pete Buttigieg, John Hickenlooper, and Jake Niece. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Mesa County Pro Bono Project - Board member
Grand Valley Ducks Unlimited - Board member
Heritage Heights Homeowners Association - President
Colorado Bar Association - member
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I would like to play a part in the redrawing of the congressional and legislative districts. I think it is my civic duty to contribute where I can, and I can here. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My job as a district attorney is to create agreement between people by presenting them with facts. My job also requires a fairness and impartiality for the effective and efficient administration of the justice system. My time on the board of the Pro Bono Project also helped me develop skills in promoting consensus among professional organizations that have diverse and sometimes competing interests in order to attain a common goal. With the Grand Valley Ducks Unlimited chapter I contributed by soliciting donations from various organizations and businesses and also took recommendations from various stakeholders in the community to the board for consideration. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As an attorney I have spent years developing my analytical skills. Applying logic and reason to problems is also a daily task for me. While making a decision for bringing criminal charges, I have look at the facts presented to me and analyze how they fit within the laws of the state. I often have to make determinations based upon logical conclusions that can be drawn from the information presented to me prior to that decision. I also bring the logic and reason to solving any problems I encounter as a parent. Recently there was a safety concern at my child&#39;s daycare and my wife and I brought to the attention of the supervisory staff and requested a meeting. In an area where it is easy to get emotional and defensive, there were no raised voices or short tempers; just conversation and understanding that lead to a resolution all parties could support.
