<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am a registered democrat and have found myself getting more politically involved over the last few years. I have been involved in several non-partisan races for our city council including for Greeley City Councilperson Tommy Butler and Greeley City Councilperson Stacy Suniga. Additionally, I served on a vacancy committee that appointed Dr Mary Young to the Colorado House of Representatives 50th district. I have campaigned for several candidates mostly as a part of coordinated campaigning for Hilary Clinton, Jared Polis, and Joe Biden. Finally, I most recently served as an election judge/election office technician for the 2020 general election with the Weld County elections office. Additionally, I donated to several coordinated campaigns including the following in the past: 
•	ActBlue
•	Demand Progress Action
•	Andrew Romanoff
•	Bernie Sanders
•	David Goldfischer
•	Diana Bray
•	Elizabeth Warren

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I currently serve as the chair of the board for the Greeley Urban Renewal Authority, I am currently up for reapproval, I was voted in by the rest of the board but have yet to be reappointed by City leadership (I have an interview next week for this purpose.) I also am a member of the Greeley-Evans School District 6 Citizens’ Bond Oversight Committee. I have recently finished serving in the Association of Intermountain housing Officers (AIMHO) where I served on the Executive Committee as both the Technology Coordinator and the Corporate Relations Coordinator. I also participated in the Imagine Greeley long-range planning group. I was a member of the Greeley Evans Transit Master Planning group. You can see my other involvement on my résumé, but these are the most relevant too this question.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
In addition to the previously mentioned activities I have supported organizing for racial justice in the summer of 2020 such as the Black Live Matter movement’s peaceful events and marches in Greeley.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that Independent Redistricting Commissions are a true example of the American democracy experiment in action. While most states assign this task to the state legislature. I believe that Colorado’s recent voter-approved move to develop these commissions helps to make this a fairer process for all Coloradans. Democracy has long been concerned with the separation of powers and separate that power of people responsible for drawing and approving electoral districts from the folks looking to be elected in those districts is important for all to continue to have faith in their elected officials. A transparent and impartial process will help make our democracy better. Clearly lines and boundaries are important to many processes; for instance, my neighbors and my household share a fence. This fence represents our property lines and is helpful for us to coexist in a shared space and to help us determine our own private spaces. As another example the boundaries of my city are important to help us determine taxes, laws, and other civic tools. Similarly, political districts should aim to help all Coloradans understand who is represent them and they should reflect real and perceived boundaries. These boundaries should consider equal population of course but also take into consideration partisan fairness, racial minorities, language and culture, as well as be common-sense boundaries that strive for compactness and contiguity. Furthermore, as a resident of a fast-growing community I hope that the commissions can take into account the updated data about citizens and where they live and help to shape fair districts. 
I believe my opinion would be helpful on this commission due to my experience and education. I have a bachelor’s degree in Physics and Computer Science as well as a master’s degree in Higher Education Administration. Furthermore, I have educational experience in Statistics from my continuing academic pursuits. Finally, I serve as a member of the Greeley Urban Renewal Authority and I would embrace the opportunity to help use all these skills, education, and experience to be a member of this commission. The opportunity to participate in this commission would allow for me to help put my knowledge and experience as a citizen to work to help improve my community and ensure that future elections help to truly represent the will of people in our communities. As we have learned during the history of our country and our state, the vote is critical to ensuring that democracy works for all of us and representation in government allows us to have our voices and opinions heard.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have 10+ years of work supervising and advising teams. In my time at Texas Tech University I supervised 45 student staff, three graduate assistants, and two administrative staff. I was able to help shape our department and University as we managed organizational change including the creation of a blended division of institutional equity and division of student affairs, this included business continuity planning as we worked to unify divisional policies and procedures. I currently work with a smaller team of 6 direct supervisees, however with any group building consensus is important. In my work I strive to ensure that we can develop policies that help to give everyone a voice and are just. My time working with groups has taught me that everyone has an opinion and that collective decision making requires tact, understanding and sacrifice. In  a process like redistricting there are many goals so I come into this recognizing that, if I were selected, my mandate would be to make our districts more just and fair and benefits that might benefit me would need to be set aside in this process. My education and experience have given me a lot of insight into how to be a part of a community. I also know that I come into life with a lot of privileges. If selected I would hope to come at redistricting with a mindset toward both fairness and offering the same opportunities that have helped me succeed in life to all —particularly those who identify with marginalized populations. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I work in a complex field where I manage, the logistics of customer service, facilities management, and occupancy management for a university housing system. I also bring a variety of analytical and origination skills from my academic background in Physics, Computer Science, Education Administration, and coursework in Statistics, Group Leadership, Management, Finance, Information Systems, etc. I believe this experience covers the categories of, creative analytical skills, critical thinking skills, communication skills, and research skills. As an example of my creative analytical skills; I currently manage $3.8 million in facilities management budgets and ensure these funds are spent in furthering housing mission and institutional goals within institutional and state policies. I would bring critical thinking skills to this team if selected though experience with project management. I work with multiple simultaneous projects daily and have developed personal and shared systems to ensure tasks and deadlines are being met. I have been advising students in groups and as individuals since 2006 and I would bring this history of communication skills such as problem-solving and consensus-building to this task. Finally, as an academic I have plenty of research skills, which I hope to bring to this group and to the task of Colorado Independent Redistricting.
