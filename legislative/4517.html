</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
See application/attachment. I have clipped all political donations in that document.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I will be a co-chair of the Colorado Chapter of PACE Nation. A group that will support the education of PACE Financing for commercial properties in Colorado. The Chapter is set to launch Spring 2021 and will be a trade group chapter. I am a registered Democrat. I am a member of the steering committee of my undergraduate college (Davidson College in NC) charged with replacing an old fraternity with a checkered racial history with a new, inclusive civic organization focused on educating young members on the importance of civic engagement and voting. Ambassador for the University of Denver for prospective new students. Teachers and students nominate for these ambassadors each year. DU MBA alumnus ‘2018.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I spent four years (2012-2016) leading advocacy for Conservation Colorado on issues related to energy. I lobbied at the statehouse during legislative sessions for those four years in support of policies that advanced clean energy and protected the Colorado environment and outdoors. I managed ~15 staffers engaging at the state house as well as other rulemaking bodies (e.g. the Colorado Public Utilities Commission) and State Agencies (e.g. CDPHE). A large portion of this work included advocating for and educating communities of color – particularly Latino communities – on environmental protections and safeguards.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My career started in politics (7-8 years) but has decidedly shifted to the private sector (4 years) with a focus on finance. The combination of public sector and private sector gives me the unique experience and ability to be an effective redistricting commissioner. My political experience affords me firsthand experience in understanding the importance of why fairly drawn state and federal districts are critical as well as firsthand experience of how public policy at the state and federal level affects our everyday lives. My private sector experience has given me the ability to analyze and understand large datasets that the redistricting commission will be tasked to work with. Fair maps are critical to ensuring Colorado’s state and federal districts truly reflect the macro Colorado population. In my opinion, the actual shape of district maps should have little-to-no bearing on what a district looks like. Rather, districts should proportionally re[resent Colorado’s population. I stepped away from career politics about four years ago to pursue a career in the private sector. While I have maintained some bare involvement in politics through making online donations to candidates and causes I support and more recently upped my civic engagement involvement through steering committee volunteer work at my undergrad alma mater regarding young civic work, a civic engagement void remains in my life. I cannot think of a better way to reengage civic life and improve my community and the Centennial state than by helping ensure state and federal districts are fair and representative of ALL Coloradans. Having worked for several different campaigns and advocacy groups, my career is ripe with political science experience. With a recently earned MBA from DU and a current career focus on finance and analyzing financial deals related to commercial real estate, I possess a strong understanding of urban (and rural) development as well as numerical and financial analysis.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The steering committee I am on at my alma mater (Davidson College) regarding how to transition a controversial male fraternity with a checkered past on racial issues from 1920-1980 into a new organization bent on educating young students on the importance of civic engagement and voting has been a crash course in working with differing viewpoints while working towards a common goal. Many of the fraternity’s alumni (of which I am one) have been either dismissive of the effort as ‘cancel culture’ while the other contingent asserts more should be done to apologize for the fraternity’s past generation transgressions as well as more forcefully and more quickly transform it into a new org focused on student civic engagement. As a member of the steering committee and co-chair of alumni outreach, I have spoken with alumni on both sides of the issue. Over the course of the past four months through dozens of conversations with alumni from the 80s, 90, 2000s, and 2010s I have successfully helped navigate the transition to the point where 275+ alumni have signed a letter of support of the current organizational trajectory. Keep in mind the average annual class size is about 12 students. The list of supporters spans every graduating class dating back to 1986. Over the course of the dozens of conversations, I helped opposing members of both sides of the issue understand the merits and thinking behind the other side. These discussions have led to this successful engagement and growing list of alumni support across the political and generational spectrum. As an MBA student at the University of Denver, I was voted into leadership positions on several group projects and by faculty/staff. As a leader of our group capstone in our second year, led our group to support a capstone project despite very divergent views on what kind of organization to support through our work. By holding several meetings that not only encouraged but required team members to voice their desired and concerns over the direction of the capstone, we were able to decide on supporting Energy Outreach Colorado. By leading the group and achieving a strong consensus for the capstone despite diverging views at the onset of the class on, we produced the “most impressive and detailed” capstone project any DU class has completed in the professor’s 5+ years of teaching the course. While my political career shows I am and have been a Democrat, I have a long history of engaging with Republicans. For starters my dad is a lifelong Republicans who worked for the Reagan administration. While my dad and I disagree on certain policies, it is clear over the dozens of years we’ve discussed politics that it is imperative to understand and empathize with the other side no matter the issue. Additionally, I helped promote my colleague, Grant Nelson, a registered Republican, to Governor Polis’s New Energy Improvement District regarding C-PACE administration in the state. In short, I have a long personal and professional record of working with “the other side” and believe fair treatment and discourse is key to success in politics. My background in the public and now private sector has afforded me the unique skillset of both possessing political acumen as well as strong analytical expertise to carry out the task of the Redistricting Commission impartially and effectively.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My job requires I produce models on how to optimally leverage financing for certain commercial real estate transactions. I view my job as relatively simple in that I let the numbers speak for themselves. I go to great lengths to ensure no overly conservative or rosy projections are in my financial analyses. Rather, I use numbers and inputs pulled from the most accurate data possible and let the numbers tell their own story. While that approach sounds simple, it is easy to start fiddling with numbers to make a deal or project look better (or worse) than it would otherwise. Doing that jeopardizes my and my company’s credibility. That is why I am steadfast in ensuring the numbers are as even-keeled as possible. I believe it is critical to approach the Redistricting Committee with the same approach. Let the numbers/data speak for itself while ensuring the sources of said data are as accurate as possible. If the Committee takes that approach the work – at least from a numbers standpoint – should be relatively straight forward. My public and private sector experience has afforded me the following skill sets: budgeting, restructuring, collaboration, data analytics, project management, data interpretation, mediation, problem solving, consensus building, data accuracy, and data integrity.
