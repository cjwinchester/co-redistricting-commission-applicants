<h3>Background</h3>

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Aside from voting and some activity supporting the Republican Party call center in 2016, I have not been active in political activity since I moved to Colorado from Rhode Island in 2011.  I received an education in small town politics while living in Rhode Island, and learned &quot;how things really work,&quot; at least in that part of Rhode Island. I was elected to public officer In Tiverton, RI, admittedly a small office in a small town.  I co-founded the Tiverton Citizens for Change (TCC), which became the focus of a protracted  struggle with the town’s deeply entrenched existing order.  There was significant push back from this group, but eventually we prevailed, and the TCC succeeded in changing Tiverton politics, winning majorities on both the Budget Committee and Town Council.  We also were able to change the Tiverton Town Charter and restructuring the Tiverton Financial Town Meeting (FTM), which for the first time gave the town’s citizens a direct vote in the Tiverton budget process.     
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
To serve.  I think it is my duty to voluntarily support the community in which I live; I love Colorado and especially Colorado Springs.  In a military, business and civilian career that spanned over 40 years, I have lived in multiple locations—and visited many more while traveling or on active duty—and I have developed insights into what&#39;s good and what&#39;s bad, and the unique and wonderful nature of Colorado.  This is a very special place, and I believe my participation in this critically important effort would assist in keeping it that way and perhaps, make it better.     

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have the practical experience and a proven track record of success in reaching agreement among organizations with diverse agendas and objectives.  An open mind and a willingness to reason and compromise will usually achieve success among people of good will, regardless of the issues at hand.  After 30 years on active duty in the USN, three years in business, four years as a professor at the Naval War College and 12 years as a government employee, I am used to dealing with difficult and complex issues, and achieving consensus with diverse groups with differing agendas.  I look forward to working with the other commissioners and resolving the many difficult issues that we will encounter.  I expect the discussions and final recommendations sometimes will be difficult and even ugly on occasion, but I have the proven skills and practical experience to lead the group and make the effort a success.  
I have a duty-driven sense of fairness and equity.  While working towards an appointed task—or while acting in an official capacity—I am able to compartmentalize, see all sides of an issue impartially, and make sound and fair decisions and produce unbiased recommendations.  I think I would be an ideal member of this commission.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
The first and most important step in resolving a problem is to first define the problem.  There is a trick here that requires removing emotional attachments and other intellectual baggage, and determine the nature, scope and meaning of what exactly is being asked.  This is a process which has rules and procedures.  It is not a mechanical progression, but one which requires personal interaction and effort by all participants.  Once the problem is defined and all participants agree, a way forward can be agreed upon, and the process can proceed.  The issue can be scoped, data collected and digested, courses of actions determined, recommendations made and a solution determined.  Data collection and digestion will be key elements in the success of this effort.  It is an iterative and logical process which requires input and engagement by all participants, but (assuming good will and willingness by all hands) will result in successful mission accomplishment.
