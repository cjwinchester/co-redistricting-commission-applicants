<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
As a board member for the Mile High Freedom Bands, I represent our bands to sister organizations, such as other LGBTQ+ music groups, and other advocacy groups. When I was an Associate for Strategies 360, I represented a number of different organizations and causes at both the state and local levels, including PERA, the groups seeking to repeal the death penalty, and health care organizations. In these experiences, I have had to understand the intricate details of the organizations I have represented to properly advocate for their needs. 
</p>

Since November 10, 2015, I have donated to New Era Colorado, Hillary Clinton, Cary Kennedy, Robin Kniech, the Democratic National Committee, and Briana Titone. 

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Since fall of 2018, I have played and performed with the Mile High Freedom Bands, and since July 2019, I have served as a board member for the bands as well. We are committed to making positive contributions to the LGBTQ+ community and allies through musical events and activities that engage, excite, educate, and entertain audiences while supporting performers of all abilities.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As a millennial woman, I would ensure that a diverse voice is brought to the table. These commissions and groups tend to skew older and male because of the time commitment that is required. I am a busy working mom, but I believe in equitable maps. I think my unique perspective as a young, engaged, woman would be an invaluable voice for the commission. 

It is more important than ever to have fair maps that are drawn with a diverse perspective in mind. Colorado has changed a great deal in the last 10 years, and I believe having a diverse set of stakeholders around the table is imperative to an independent and collaborative process. 

I am involved in my community at large, and the opportunity to play a role in creating fair, equitable maps would be a great honor. I am thankful that the voters saw the importance of establishing this process, and I hope to have the privilege of serving on the commission. 

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I’m a listener. I am not interested in being the loudest voice in the room. Instead, I want to take the time to hear other’s perspectives, understand the rationale behind them, and come to an informed decision after having all the pertinent information. I do not want to play politics; I want to ensure that we have a fair process where many diverse voices are heard. 

In 2017, for CW Kniech’s office, we put together a table of experts from several different sectors to analyze how best to help individuals who were facing evictions. We expected there would be a diverse number of perspectives that would all need consideration. We also had our preconceived notions of what would work best. However, after several months of meetings, we came to an agreement with all parties of what would look best for Denver eviction legal defense and worked to implement that policy. The policy is now funded by Denver and being replicated across Colorado. Because I was able to be impartial and fair in the process, we developed a successful policy that continues to thrive today. 

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My day-to-day work requires strong analytical skills. My job requires me to listen to the needs and concerns of the community, think of legislative solutions, develop sound policy and advocate to get that policy passed. The policy development piece of that process in particular requires distilling large amounts of information into coherent ideas that can translate into actionable results for the City of Denver. I thrive when given complex problems that require hard, process driven thinking to resolve.
