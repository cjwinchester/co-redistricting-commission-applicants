I am currently a doctoral student studying Organizational Leadership and my analytical and my ability to apply logic and reason to a problem is crucial to my everyday studies and thought process which leads to problem solving using good ethics.

Safety being at the forefront and always will be for our district has guided our decision making  and thoughtfulness around solving unforseen problems. We have set our district up for success, safety and sustainability long term by coming to a consensus in terms of curriculum, budgeting, nutrition and staffing. This experience has been a challenging one but working together with my colleagues with the best interest of our students has brought much success in this process for years to come should we ever have to experience another pandemic.
