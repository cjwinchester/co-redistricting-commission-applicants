        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Karon Lee McCormick</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Karon Lee McCormick
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Karon Lee Schreder</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a retired Dental Hygienist. I was chair of the Susan G Komen Breast Cancer race for the cure the last two years. I was a campaign manager for Rep Larry Liston and an active volunteer for the Republican party, precinct leader and vice chair of House district 16.  I was a life long Republican, but the day Republicans decided character was of no importance was the day I was no longer a Republican. I am an unaffiliated voter now.  I am committed to seeing fair and consistent house and senate districts with no gerry- mandering. I am a 3rd generation native of Colorado Springs. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Health science degree, Dental Hygienist,  Pueblo community college, 1992
The Leadership program of the Rockies- 2011
The Leadership Institute in Virginia for Campaign management- 2013

</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80909
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I was an active volunteer for the Republican party pre Trump. I was a precinct leader involved in organizing teams to get out the vote, knocking on doors and making those phone calls. I was Vice chair of HD 16. I was a campaign manager for Representative Larry Liston and worked closely with him to promote other candidates until Trump when I changed my party affiliation. After that, I worked tirelessly for Susan G Komen. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Recently I have donated to Joe Biden/ Kamala Harris, Kamala Harris during the primary and Amy Klobuchar also during the primary. I donated to Hillary Clinton in 2015. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have been extremely active with the Susan G Komen organization for Breast cancer. The last two years I was chair for the Race for the Cure held in the Garden of the Gods, the year before I was an active volunteer for the same organization. This took a great deal of time and effort as we spent 9-10 months planning and organizing for the Race. It was akin to putting on a wedding for 5,000 people.  This year it was virtual. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am a 3rd generation native of Colorado Springs and I have seen the gerry mandering of these districts up close, the behind the scenes wheeling and dealing and I want to see that this is stopped in the state that I love. I want fair elections and in order to have fair elections there needs to be fair, common sense districts. One vote should equal one vote not be smothered out because of any gerry mandering or wild lines drawn on a geographical map to benefit one party over another. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have done exactly that with the leadership positions I have held. I value character, integrity and honor above all else and hold myself to those same standards. I set a high bar. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I chaired the Komen Race for the Cure for the last two years and you don&#39;t get that done without analytical, logic and reasoning skills. I managed many people and business&#39;s to get that done and I did that with the wonderful assistance of committed volunteers who I directed. I also did that as a precinct leader, a vice chair of a house district and a Republican campaign manager for Representative Larry Liston.  I will provide you recommendations on consideration but I have not applied for any job in a long time and most of what I did was as an unpaid volunteer, including the Komen Race for the Cure.
