<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I was a software project manager for about 15 years. This included cost projections for various projects, scheduling work, analyzing the customer’s problems, designing and then implementing the solution, and managing the members of my teams.  Over that time I managed many projects. Most of the projects were started at the original analysis and design stage and proceeded to the first iteration of the final product. I did not manage maintenance projects. I often had the beginnings of the project personnel with me during this first stage of a project. It was my policy to listen to the ideas of everyone on the project and come to a consensus of the best way to solve the customer’s problem. Sometimes my ideas were implemented and sometimes someone else’s ideas were better. We negotiated among ourselves until a consensus was reached. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I think gerrymandering political districts is wrong and results in false representation of the populace. I want help to remedy that situation in Colorado.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The projects that I worked on usually involved problems that had never be solved before. Therefore, they began with brainstorming to find a possible solution and then coming up with a method to implement that solution. Occasionally there were many iterations of both problem solving and solution design before the optimal one was discovered. Toward the end of my career I changed my focus to Process Improvement. It is a method that demands that the current process in an organization be analyzed to find choke points and redundancies in an organizations current process. Then to design a solution to streamline the process. This also involves convincing a given organization that they would benefit from the recommended changes to their process.
