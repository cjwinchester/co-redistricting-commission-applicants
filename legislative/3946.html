<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Father served on a Planning Commission, City Council, and eventually served as Mayor in town I grew up in.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
None
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have worked as a Manager at both IBM and UCHealth. In both positions I had large teams in multiple locations that had to work together toward common goals. My management style was often described as democratic, since bringing consensus across the team members would insure their buy-in and ultimately achieve success for the team and our projects. I started a Dog Agility Club in Colorado in the late 1990&#39;s since there was not a club in Northern Colorado, this in turn created opportunities for dog owners in this part of the state. Later I became an AKC Agility Judge in Colorado and also judged across the country. As an agility judge part of my challenge was to create a fun successful experience for ALL breeds of dogs, which obviously vary widely. Through this experience I became very familiar with most of the fairgrounds across our state and elsewhere. I was the Quilt Show Chair for the Longmont Quilt Guild in 2019. This was our largest event and involved over 100 guild members quilts and experienced our largest attendance over the two days. I have a small flock of sheep and while it is small, I have some understanding of the agricultural community and believe I could represent this minority, at least to some degree.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that more Americans should take an active role in serving our communities. This is often hard for folks working 40 hour/week jobs and taking care of their families. I am currently in a position where I have the time to serve our community and would like to give something back to the state of Colorado which has been a fantastic place to call home for over 20 years. This is an amazing place to live and I would like to help make sure that it is in the future. I believe this opportunity will open my eyes too many things about our government processes and state constitution that I would like to further understand. The bottom line is I want to do something positive to make a difference.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Throughout my lifetime I have displayed impartiality which lead to a career as a successful manager and even judging dog shows. Both of these roles required one to look at all the information presented to come to a consensus or decision. I strongly promote that every voice should be heard and considered. I also understand that all voices may not speak out but still deserve the right to be heard.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My formal education in Computer Science and Mathematics laid a great foundation for ability to apply logic and analyze data and situations. Throughout my career I have exercised these skills to find solutions for teams and organizations. I have created and lead data analytics teams to solve problems with reduced costs continually. For instance, optimizing use of Operating Rooms to save over $1 Billion annually for a healthcare system. Data used properly can definitely be utilized to make improvements. I also understand that not all data is of quality and should not be utilized when making important decisions. Knowing how to check data for accuracy is a asset I believe I would able to bring to this committee should I be chosen.
