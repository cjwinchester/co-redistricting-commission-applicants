<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am not particularly politically active, though I am an active voter. Since 2015 I have contributed less than $200 to any campaign or political organization. I volunteered for two events for Governor Polis during the 2018 Colorado gubernatorial race. I served as a host/MC/DJ for those events.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
National Association of Multicultural Engineering Program Advocates (NAMEPA, Inc.): President-Elect 2018-2020
City of Wheat Ridge Colorado Planning Commission: District I Commissioner
Great Outdoors Colorado (GOCO): Board Member, Congressional District 7
Lutheran Medical Center Foundation: Board Member
The Giboney Foundation: Director, Education Programs &amp; Denver Outreach, Treasurer
-none of the above positions are paid
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Currently, I serve on several community-focused organizations/boards. These organizations serve a wide variety of community members, stakeholders, and interests. I would not characterize myself as a community organizer. I would characterize my volunteer activities as community representation and community advocacy. Typically, my volunteer activities focus on underserved or underrepresented populations. For several years, I helped to represent and advocate for underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students pursuing engineering degrees. While I continue to provide representation and advocacy in that area, I have recently been afforded the opportunity to expand my focus to include local community planning, outdoor engagement, and philanthropy.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the Legislative Redistricting Commission to help continue creating fair and representative congressional/legislative districts in Colorado and I believe I have the skill set, experience, and perspective to help in this important process.

I grew up in Summit County, Colorado. My father worked at Climax Mine in Leadville and my mother worked at the Summit Medical Center in Frisco. I reference Summit because “up there” I learned about life far outside a major city and how isolating it can feel, at times. I earned a small scholarship to attend the University of Colorado at Boulder where I studied aerospace engineering and began my professional career as a structural analyst at Ball Aerospace, working on satellite structural design. My career shifted from direct work with technology to indirect when I became an administrator at Colorado School of Mines, where I worked for nearly 19 years. Currently, I am the Senior Manager in the Workforce Development group at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). My professional career has been primarily focused on technology and education.

I have learned working in the tech and education sectors that there are no perfect solutions and that any decision can have unintended, negative consequences. Knowing this does not mean I cannot make challenging decisions, I believe knowing this helps me to look “down the road” at the potential outcomes, evaluate the pros and cons – short term, medium-term, and long term.

Colorado is a tremendous state. We have excellent institutions of higher education, strong industries, and a diverse population. Colorado is not without its challenges and by continuing to work together we can meet those challenges and serve as a model state to the union. Having fair and representative congressional and legislative districts provides the means for the full community of Colorado, regardless of political party affiliation, upbringing, financial status, etc., to participate in our growth and advancement.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have a long history of working with people from different educational, financial, and cultural backgrounds. I have interacted with students across Colorado and the nation, their parents, and communities. I have been elected Chair/President of non-profit organizations focused on student access and success in college. I managed small teams at Colorado School of Mines and I currently manage a small team at NREL.  I consider myself a listener, a learner, and a leader – in that order, and I am an avid reader. It is critical for me to be impartial and fair-minded in my current Board roles I am in as my decisions can have a lasting impact on the educational community, the housing and business community, the outdoor community, and the medical community.
 
I have a quasi-judicial role on the Wheat Ridge Planning Commission. As I am not an elected official of Wheat Ridge, my role is required to be impartial. I remember one case where there was a proposed change to an ordinance. From my reading, it seemed a straightforward case and I believed a yes vote would be of benefit to the community. However, after hearing the public comments during the commission meeting it became clear to me that I did not have the full picture. The training I received emphasized the practice of not coming to a final decision until all comments on a case were heard and it proved to be crucial in that case. I plan to bring the same perspective to the commissions - public comment will be instrumental in my decision-making process.  

I have traveled to many of Colorado’s counties and have interacted with members of those communities. I have traveled to over 40 states in the US and I have traveled a modest amount internationally. Interacting with people locally, across Colorado, nationwide, and internationally has helped shape and grow my perspective and, I hope, has helped me to grow my “EQ”.

I am a musician, a lyricist, and, prior to the pandemic, played live regularly with my band. I play the piano – and take weekly piano lessons. I have worked to balance my “left brain” and “right-brain” thinking and have found that engaging with music is key to this process.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am an engineer by education and training and I have found the engineering method to be an effective tool for reaching solutions. In my early professional career, I worked as a structural analyst on satellite structures mainly using finite element analysis techniques to determine design integrity.  The work required an understanding of physics and materials science, computer programming, data analysis, estimating uncertainty/error, and reporting.

I have an MBA from the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado at Boulder, focusing on Small Business Management and Entrepreneurship and I have managed small teams professionally for over 15 years. I have managed budgets in the low millions working with internal stakeholders and outside vendors regularly. My work in higher education involved building and running recruitment programs, retention programs, and professional development programs. I currently manage internship and postdoctoral programs at NREL, regularly communicating with employees, Department of Energy officials, faculty, and administrators.

I have been elected to lead 501(c)(3) organizations, locally, regionally, and nationally. I have worked to build consensus across organizations through meetings, presentations, panel discussions, etc.

I add these details to demonstrate that I have a wide and unique set of interests, experiences, and skills which I believe will be of value to the commission.
