        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Mark Frederick Jacobson</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Mark Frederick Jacobson
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Mark F Jacobson, Mark Jacobson</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Principal Software Engineer with Babel Street, Inc.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I possess a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics from Kearney State College (now the University of Nebraska – Kearney).  These three majors are all comprehensive which means each is a double major in that field.  This is equivalent to 6 majors.  I also possess a Master of Science degree in Operations Research from the University of Southern California.  This includes training in Artificial Intelligence, Linear Algebra, Game Theory and Simulation.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80124
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
For the past 20 years, I have talked with hundreds of Christians, atheists, and agnostics about the symmetry and congruence of scientific and theologic principles and beliefs in such venues as the People’s Fair and the Boulder Creek Festival in my capacity as a Reasons to Believe Denver Chapter officer.  Always listening and trying to understand their unique and diverse thoughts and opinions while also advancing my own.  Since Science; the study of God’s creation and Theology; the study of God’s divinely inspired word, both come from a common source (God), they must be consistent with each other.  If not, there is a problem with our interpretation and application of one or both.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
2020 Douglas County Republican poll watcher
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Reasons to Believe, Mission Hills Church
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Our grand and novel experiment in a constitutional federal republican form of government has stood the test of time for 233 years.  However, we seem to be at a cross-road.  Will we continue to stand for fair and free elections where all races and creeds are fully represented or will we succumb to the temptation of political short-term gain where the end justifies the means.  Extreme gerrymandering is harmful no matter which political party it appears to benefit.  I believe my strong and unique analytical and personal skills will serve the commission well in establishing fair and unbiased district boundaries.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have spent my career solving and optimizing scientific problems.  This often means analytically resolving multiple constraints where some of these constraints actually oppose each other.  Because of my unique skills and personality, I have often found myself acting as a conduit between management and engineers.  I am able to speak both languages as it were and am thus able to reform what one side is saying in new terms the other can understand.  Compromise has become a dirty word in modern politics.  The mantra seems to consist of “opposition at all costs.”  If we are to survive as a nation, this must stop.  Both sides of the aisle must learn to reach across to the other side to find common ground; creating new and innovative solutions for the common good of our citizens.  In a truly fair solution, no one gets everything they want, but hopefully each gets the thing(s) most important to them.   I was born and raised on a farm just outside of Kearney Nebraska.  After college, I moved from Kearney; a town of 30,000 people to Los Angeles; a town of 30,000,000 highly diverse people.  My wife and I moved to Denver in 1996.  I understand both rural and urban concerns.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am a software engineer with a broad background in creative scientific problem solving with the use of large datasets and complex constraints.  I have used and written many GIS based applications.  Optimal solutions must not only meet cyber constraints, but must also satisfy the needs of multiple human stake-holders. References available upon request.
