        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Elizabeth Shaw</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Elizabeth Shaw
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Liz Shaw</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I currently work for Occasions Catering as a member of the service staff. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a BA in Psychology from the University of Virginia and an MA in International Studies from the University of Denver. I will also be working on a Paralegal certificate beginning in January.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80223
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not donated money to any campaigns or political organizations since 2015. I recently worked as an election judge in the 2020 General Election.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have volunteered with Showing Up For Racial Justice Denver. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Since I moved to Colorado in Sept. 2015, I have not worked extensively as an organizer or advocate. However, I have experience with prioritizing community needs and listening to a variety of points of view and coming to a consensus: I was a team captain for 2 years on the swim team in undergrad, I completed a research project on wage theft in Denver in graduate school, and I have worked for over 7 years with youth in various capacities. And I try to stay involved in initiatives, campaigns, and daily work of a variety of organizations in Colorado from the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition to the DPS school board.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Quite honestly, I am making a concerted effort to become more involved in the governmental activities of our state. I loved my experience as an election judge, and I consider the representation of all Coloradans in federal and state legislature an incredibly important initiative in 2021, especially as it relates to communities of interest. Colorado has a variety of constituents who need to be fairly and equitably represented and resourced, and I hope to be a part of the commission that hears their needs and prioritizes them in the districting process.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Since I am not intimately involved in organizing or advocating on behalf of my political party, I consider myself to be more of a &quot;Switzerland&quot; political representative. I want to hear from the people who are going to be affected by legislative changes: what are their concerns and how do we effectively address those concerns as a commission? And I believe that ultimately we are not bringing any of our personal beliefs to the commission- this is a job that is intended to be impartial, and it is a necessity to hear from others and to use data to determine the best possible scenarios. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am comfortable synthesizing information from multiple sources in a concise brief/summary, and I have worked over the past ten years in school and in a variety of jobs to maintain a critical lens through which I view any problem, especially as it relates to social/economic/political issues. I am comfortable with both quantitative and qualitative analysis and consider both methodologies to be crucial for a full understanding of a problem and a potential solution.
