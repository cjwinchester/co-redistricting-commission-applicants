<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
During my career and community life in metropolitan Denver, I have had the opportunity to work with small, emerging, minority, and women owned businesses to assist them in working with the State of Colorado, other public institutions, and corporations. I have worked as a volunteer at KUVO Public Radio Station as an on-air host. I worked as a member of a curatorial team to Mexico, Colombia and Brazil to build working relationships with theatre and performing artists to perform in the United States. Using these travels to see cultural performances around our hemisphere, I was able to bring home important improvements to our work. As a
member of the American GI Forum, I have been given the opportunity to advocate on behalf of Latino veterans and their families to ensure they receive their benefits and create educational opportunities for the families of the veterans. I have also served on numerous boards of directors of non-profit organizations over the past 40 years working in the fields of human services, mental health and economic development. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Crisanta Duran, 2016; Joseph Salazar, 2017; Xochitl Gaytan School Board 2017; Victoria Lopez 2019; Adrienne Benavidez 2016
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
American GI Forum Mile High Chapter, KUVO Public Radio Station, Su Teatro Cultural &amp; Performing Arts Center, Jeffco Democratic Latino Initiative
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have wanted to continue public service after retirement and believe that I can bring my knowledge and ability to create a redistricting plan that is fair and equitable to the entire state of Colorado. When working with the Colorado Department of Transportation as the Director of the Center for Equal Opportunity, I had the opportunity to work with the Transportation Commission and understand the commitment I would be making if selected. I believe I could bring a unique perspective as a native Coloradan who has close ties to colleagues, family and friends from across the State that includes both metropolitan centers as well as rural Colorado. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my role as Director of the Center for Equal Opportunity at CDOT and before that at the Regional Transportation District, I worked with numerous stakeholders that included large and small business owners, prime and subcontractors, impacted communities, elected officials, and grassroots community members. When we would set annual goals for business and employment, it was important to hold and lead discussions that would eventually bring groups to a consensus. On many occasions it was critical for me to put my personal feelings aside and work to find agreement with all parties. I also understand that once agreement is found between a group of decision makers that it is important to support the final decisions and not undermine those made by the group.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As noted above, on an annual basis, I was responsible for working independently as well as with my staff and consultants to analyze past and current data (small business utilization, employment date (broken down by gender, race, ethnicity, age, ability, etc.), census information, and more) to develop goals and activities for the
next year. These goals and plans were presented to the effected communities, employees, businesses, and elected and appointed officials. It was critical that I understood the data analysis, anecdotal information, survey information and more when proposing goals and plans. In addition, I became proficient in reading, understanding and interpreting Federal Regulations and State Statutes in order to 
ensure that our programs and plans were in compliance with Federal and State Rules and Regulations.
