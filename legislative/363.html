<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I lack formal experience in participating in these groups. I have been a member of organizations like Trout Unlimited but until recently my advocacy was strictly on a personal basis.  I have spent a lot of time working with friends and acquaintances to discuss the issues and platforms I feel are important for Colorado. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
No formal involvement besides voting and independent research of the candidates and issues.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that Washington was correct when he said that political parties could lead the country to despotism, and partisan gerrymandering and redistricting are a prime example of how the rights of the individual citizen can be eroded to promote the welfare of a party. I believe the key to having a functional government lies in reducing the ability of any party to twist the will of the voters and that in a proportional representational system, ensuring that the proportions are fair and equal is the first step to ensuring that the will of the electorate is maintained.  I believe that we need more people who are not members of any party, and therefore, lack a vested interest in seeing their &#39;team&quot; win. I also feel that my background in QA is something that is needed on the commission. QA requires a unique perspective where your main goal is to point out flaws without making them into personal attacks. The role of QA is to keep people honest about the state of things, not only to the customer but within the organization itself. I feel that this is a necessary function that is often overlooked when trying to build a high performing team. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a QA lead and release manager, I have spent the last decade working to build consensuses between various stakeholders involved in a a number of different projects. I recognize that it is important to hear and address all voices that have an interest in the outcome, but that you cannot let the perfect become the enemy of the good. Sooner or later you have to make decisions and an imperfect decision made timely is better than a perfect decision made too late. You will never fix all bugs in a piece of software, or in a redistricting map, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t release a good or even great piece of work. I believe that the key to being a functional team is to have a strong set of core values and working towards those. As long as you have strategic alignment, individual issues become a series of small tactical compromises that allow each group to feel their voice is being heard. I would work to identify the strategic goals of the commission and apply software engineering methodology, where appropriate, to resolve the disagreements. Software development is a lot like politics, as it should be a meritocracy but in reality tends to be dominated by individuals with strong personalities. I believe the techniques I have used to achieve success dealing with programmers would translate well to building strong working relationships with other members of the commission. I am not swayed by bullying or persuasion, but focus on facts and figures. I understand how things can be wrong even if they are technically correct.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In my daily life as a QA engineer, I spend the vast majority of my time analyzing the work of other people. I am trained to look for logical flaws in calculations. I understand that trust comes from testing and confirmation, not pretty presentation or slick graphics. I write user stories and test cases constantly, using logic and reason to analyze how any particular program or piece of data will be used. Formal logic is a large part of determining positive and negative paths for test cases. I use reason to perform root cause analysis and identify areas of regression.
I am experienced in handling large data sets, data transformations, graphing, and statistics. I am capable of taking raw data sets and writing my own queries and analysis in several different programming languages and tools. I have spent years analyzing calculations that others have written looking for flaws in logic and reason. I have previously worked with a wide variety of data type including demographic data, economic data, and medical billing data.  I am well versed in performing needs analysis, regression analysis, happy path and negative path testing, and gap analysis. 

In terms of skills, I have taken courses in formal logic, economics, business, mathematics, and philosophy. I am a certified Agile Scrum Master and Product Owner. I have taken training in Project Management and interpersonal relationships. I have experiencing leading teams of other engineers. 
Some of the projects I have worked on include: Writing a web application to handle mortgage applications, developing an HR system to track employee complaints, doing document analysis to assemble evidence for EPA criminal prosecutions, programming predictive dialing systems for customer service agents, and performing security auditing at a credit agency. I am currently employed at a DoD contractor working on network security software.
