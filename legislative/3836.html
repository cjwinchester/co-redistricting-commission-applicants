<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I became a citizen in 2011 and ever since then, I have voted and been active in grassroots politics. I am a precinct organizer and served as a co-captain in my house district. I am a disability rights advocate and a health policy expert. I engage through volunteer work on boards and committees. I have donated to Lisa Calderon, Ashley Wheeland, Julie Banuelos, Tay Anderson, Bernie Sanders, Mayling Simpson, Andrew Romanoff, Cary Kennedy, Brianna Titone,...

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Colorado Cross Disabilities Coalition Colorado Disability Partners (Board) Colorado Democratic Party Denver Democrats - HD9 Democrats Colorado Foundation for Universal Health Care (Board) Justice Democrats Democratic Socialists of America - Denver chapter Working Families Party Our Revolution Women&#39;s Lobby of Colorado Pine Valley neighborhood association Action for Healthy Kids DORA State Board of Pharmacy 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I am an immigrant, a policy expert and a parent of children with disabilities. I am actively engaged in advocating for universal healthcare, inclusion for people with disabilities, patient rights in our for-profit healthcare, equity for our SPED and children of color in our educational system, justice for our communities of color and the welfare of foster children. I belong to a few civic organizations because I am interested in the cause of social justice and these struggles are inter-related. I am a grassroots political organizer, a PCP, a former candidate for school board in Denver, a woman of color and a DNC member-elect. I am very interested in seeing our political processes align with our grassroots&#39; social needs. Denver and Colorado need to work for our growing and diverse population. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the commission so that we have people who are going to be most affected by the work of redistricting to have a say in the process. As an immigrant, a woman of color, a person who has family members with disabilities, whose family has Medicaid, as someone with expertise in understanding the effects of policy and who is invested in creating humane policies that uplift our communities, I shall bring the voices of others with me. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Ethics and integrity are guiding values for me. With my professional background of working with numerous stakeholders, I can work through difficult group dynamics to achieve consensus. I am a very good listener and communicator and able to craft consensual solutions as well as show people the merits of a point of view and persuade if necessary. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have worked professionally in local, state, national and international settings as a health policy researcher. I ran a department of analytics and possess excellent analytical skills. While my values allow me to envision a more inclusive future, my logic and reasoning abilities give me the tools with which to shape that future. Here is an example: I was the person who was charged with creating a new data &amp; analytics center for the Colorado Hospital Association. Starting with understanding what were the immediate needs, future expansion capabilities to resource limitations, I created a whole new center and took it to implementation and then programmatic success. At every step, this involved stakeholders and communication and planning to take the project to fruition. As for references: I will be happy to provide stellar references to people you may call. Please let me know when you want to reach out to them. I am not attaching any recommendation letters here as I do not want to have to make anyone work to create letters without first making it through your process. I will be happy to let you know who some of the references will be from.
