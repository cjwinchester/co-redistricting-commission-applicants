</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
During my Bachelor&#39;s degree studies I was a member of the Colorado Student Association. I represented Western State University on this board from 2000-2002, and then represented CU-Denver from 2002-2003. Additionally, I was a student trustee to the (now disbanded) State Colleges Board of Trustees in 2001-2002 for Western State University. After transferring colleges, I was a student representative for the Auraria campus Board of Trustees, representing CU-Denver from 2002-2003.

I advocated for the passage of ballot measures 4A &amp; 4B in my neighborhood during the most recent election. I am a firm believer that schools need adequate funding to prepare students for the increasingly competitive world in which we live, and that teachers are generally underpaid and under-appreciated in our society. 
I am comfortable advocating for children with special needs and developmental delays, and often connect people I meet in passing to the appropriate services available to them in their community (i.e. community center boards, Child Find, Special Olympics Young Athletes, and social support groups).
I have also worked with volunteer groups in my community, such as Highlands Ranch Helps, and have organized donation drives to benefit Meghan&#39;s Wish Foundation (supporting kids in foster care), Together We Rise, and Aurora Warms the Night.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Volunteered to canvas for Obama in 2012. 
Was a paid member of the DNC 2016-2018. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Democratic National Committee member, 2016-2018
Infinity Middle School PTCO, 2019-20
Resident volunteer for Beacon Point HOA election canvas board, 2020
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Having worked with diverse families as an educator, I have some insight into the social challenges faced by people who have languages, experiences, and cultures different from my own. 
Having my own children (who both have moderate special needs) and having to advocate on their behalf has increased my confidence in understanding dense legal jargon related to special education law (even moreso than when I was a teacher) and has given me insight into the struggles others face in simply trying to gain equal footing.

It&#39;s no surprise that our country is divided on many issues currently, so having the opportunity to do something cooperative and beneficial is something I don&#39;t want to miss. While I am fairly &#39;regular&#39; as a white, female, middle-class mom, my experiences will lend themselves to advocating for those that don&#39;t share the same history as me. I do have some  have experience being a minority, as I am an atheist, and am comfortable dealing with the misconceptions that many people have about it. I believe that a secular perspective can be beneficial in these kind of matters. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am an individual who believes in equal representation and equal treatment. I am passionate about bringing people together in positive ways. My neighbors joke that I am the community welcome-wagon, and I strive to make people feel welcome and connected. 
I am more than comfortable questioning why things are the way they are, evaluating the evidence, and coming to a consensus that is fair. I understand that there are often differences between the letter and the spirit of the law, and am comfortable discussing the reasoning behind both sides. I always want to know where someone else is coming from, especially when we disagree. If I can understand their point of view, it widens my perspective on the world, and I hope that by understanding my point of view others walk away with broader horizons too. 
I am a staunch believer in fair, secular government and belive that no one group deserves special treatment because of their religious, cultural, or political affiliations. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am a firm believer is the Socratic method of discourse, wherein you ask questions and work towards ideas and beliefs being honestly examined and evaluated. My go-to statements for children and adults alike when discussing anything are &quot;Why?&quot; and &quot;Tell me more&quot;. Being a religious non-believer lends itself to valuing science &amp; logic, learning how to dissect and reconstruct ideas, and advocating for a more fair society.
