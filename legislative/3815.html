<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
In my 15 years as a Colorado resident, I have intentionally involved myself in a wide variety of organizations and agencies in order to get a good understanding of the dynamics of my Community as well as other Colorado communities.  I have been a founder of several nonprofits.  I have been appointed to Boards including a land trust, a county area planning committee, cultural organizations, a state-wide advocacy group for small businesses.  I have served in leadership roles as Board Chair or Officer.  I have been in organizing roles for events and projects including co-Chair for the 2019 Western Slope Rural Philanthropy days.  Additionally, I have used my organizational consulting skills in small town communities on the Western Slope working with Downtown Colorado Inc. and Community Heart and Soul projects.  In the North Fork Valley, I have worked as an advisor and facilitator for Board and Staff retreats and a volunteer grant writer for the Town of Paonia.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
There is no question that the population and the demographics of Colorado are changing.  It is vitally important that the districting of our elected officials adequately represent constituents.  It is honorable that Colorado is engaging in a process that is intended to be nonpartisan, inclusive  and fair.  Personally, serving on the commission would be a great learning experience an allow me to gain a better understanding of state residents, the political process, and issues that important to our future.  I believe that I can offer the commission my scientific and analytical skills, my knowledge of state demographics and, my experience as an organizational consultant in community engagement and facilitation.  

I spent over 20 years in non political roles in Washington DC prior to moving to Colorado where I learned to negotiate contracts with diverse groups (including medical centers and government agencies) and to facilitate within bureaucracies (including the Department of Defense).  My experiences prior to living in Colorado combined with my involvement in the Western Slope and statewide initiatives give me a unique perspective to look at the big picture while paying attention to the needs of the local population.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
&quot;First seek to understand, then to be understood.&quot;  The ability to promote consensus and create agreement is based on the extent to which one can actively listen to gain a clear understanding of the positions presented. Consensus is not about everyone agreeing.  Consensus is giving a fair opportunity for everyone to express themselves, then form an opinion that can be acceptable and that the majority &quot;can live with.&quot;   

Working as an organizational and process consultant taught me to &quot;seek to understand.&quot;  A good facilitator can guide a group to a place of understanding and consensus but it is the responsibility of each member of the team to commit to having an open mind, to listening to diverse points of view and to expressing points that represent their constituents.   I believe these are areas of strength for me.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My early career was as a Clinical Chemist where I was responsible for analyzing complex medical data and forming conclusions about health outcomes.  My middle career in regional sales management with a large corporation, gave experience in goal setting, in analyzing state and regional territory data and in making quarterly and annual projections.  My later career in organizational consulting enhanced my interpersonal skills, maximizing team performance and evaluating individual and team behaviors.  In recent years, I have worked on projects that required researching and analyzing data from the Colorado State Demographers&#39; Office. I found the SDO to be a tremendous resource for responding to grant applications, helping municipalities with strategic planning and working with businesses on marketing plans.
