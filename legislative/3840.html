Member--American Inns of Court National Education Committee
Commissioner / Chairman--Colorado Commission on Judicial Discipline
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As an attorney specializing in criminal law and child welfare, my experience focuses upon the representation of individuals.  At the same time, however, the representation of particular clients often overlaps with advocacy as to more general issues of public policy.  In addition, as a member of the Colorado Commission on Judicial Discipline, I serve to protect the integrity of the judicial process by working with the Commission to respond to requests for the evaluation of judicial conduct brought by members of the community at large.  Although the Executive Director is primarily responsible for making public statements and educating the public about the role of the Commission, the Commission collectively makes recommendations as part of formal proceedings.  The Commission also works collaboratively to address circumstances where disciplinary matters are resolved through an informal process.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
In 2001, I worked as a summer staff member for Oregon Secretary of State Bill Bradbury.  Under the Oregon Constitution, the Secretary of State&#39;s Office is responsible for redistricting when the Legislature is unable to enact a redistricting plan.  In 2001, the Oregon Legislature passed a redistricting plan that was vetoed by Governor John Kitzhaber.  Consequently, redistricting occurred through the Secretary of State&#39;s Office.  In my role, I was responsible for compiling the Secretary&#39;s record and assisting in the identification of statutorily defined communities of interest that supported the identification of district boundaries.  As part of the redistricting process, the Secretary of State held hearings statewide to receive public comments.  The approved redistricting plans were challenged through original proceedings in the Oregon Supreme Court.  Ultimately, the Oregon Supreme Court upheld the redistricting plans, as supported by the record.  2001 was the first time that Oregon was able to use Geographical Information System data to generate redistricting maps.   

Through my experience, I am familiar with the redistricting process and its lasting impacts upon state and national legislative bodies.  Coloradoâ€™s shift to a combined bi-partisan and non-partisan system of redistricting is a great opportunity for the state to focus legislative and congressional districts on the communities they serve rather than being primarily reflective of the partisan interests.  As a Colorado native who has spent considerable time living in Gunnison, Crawford, Trinidad, Fort Collins, and now Longmont, I am familiar with the diverse geography, history, character, interests, and identities of various communities/regions within Colorado.  

The current legislative map for the Colorado House of Representatives divides Gunnison County into two separate districts.  Given both the geography of the County and the communities within it, it is not clear why (other than for political reasons) the map was drawn as it is.  If chosen as a member of the Redistricting Commission, I feel that I could bring both experience and perspective to help focus deliberations on effective ways to define particular districts based upon their respective communities of interest.  Colo. Const. art. V, Â§ 48(2).  I would also like to help develop procedures and arrangements to make the Commissionâ€™s hearings as accessible as possible to persons throughout Colorado.  Ultimately, the primary objective of redistricting should be creating district maps that reflect the basic constitutional principal of one person one vote as effectively as possible.  A transparent redistricting process is essential to achieving this objective while also reinforcing public confidence in the electoral system.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
All negotiations, including deliberations with the objective of reaching consensus, benefit from preparation and an understanding of what is actually at issue.  In the context of redistricting, the best point of beginning is familiarity with the legal boundaries and purposes of the process.  Beyond the legal structure of redistricting, it also helps to have some familiarity with the identities and character of a spectrum of communities within Colorado to understand the significance of keeping shared interests/identities intact.  Through the identification of larger principals, goals, and factors that are beyond dispute, a productive discussion can move towards defining priorities and identifying potential areas of compromise.  Although having an intentional process for discussing issues is helpful, it depends upon an ability to respect the perspectives of others and to maintain an open mind.  If concerns or objections are raised over the course of discussion, it is best to address them directly so that everyone feels heard and problems can be corrected before they become more complex.  As with the record that will ultimately support a redistricting plan, it is important to justify decisions as they are being made.
