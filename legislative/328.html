<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I have been in the Early Childhood Profession for over 15 years. As a teacher and director I have dealt with children, parents, staff and board members making  sure all of their questions and concerns were answered.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a BA in Business Administration from Mills College. I also am a licensed Early Childhood Director with the State of Colorado.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80010
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
It is the job of a Director of preschools to communicate with both families and staff about the well being of the children  Many times there were conflicts as to what the child needed to advance developmentally between the teachers and the parents. I was the liaison between the two parties, advocating for the child and making sure everyone was heard and a plan was in place so that the child could advance socially, emotionally, physically and cognitively.

As a PFLAG Board and Policy Council member, it was my job to listen to and represent my constituents and advocate for their concerns when considering and voting on changes to the status quo. In addition, I would voice those concerns during legislative sessions at the capital. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated money to the Democratic Party and many campaigns throughout the years: Democratic Senatorial Commission, Jason Crow, Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and many others.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>

Board of Directors-PFLAG Denver-Volunteer
Head Start Policy Council-Denver Head Start-Mayor appointed
Colorado Association for the Education of the Young Child-Member
Stapleton Unified Neighborhood-member ( hasn&#39;t changed name yet)
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that each part of the community should be represented on the commission. My background and experience makes me uniquely qualified to represent the needs of families, teachers, and other professionals in the early childhood community and the impact of redistricting on education.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a Director and Board Member, I understand the critical role of consensus.  I would encourage participants to place the good of the whole group above their own individual preferences. One of my best skills is being able to encourage individuals with dissenting positions to collaborate until an equitable agreement is reached and a plan of action is developed. 

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My approach to problem solving is to collect information, identify the core issue, analyze it, and form a conclusion in a step by step manner making sure that all parties are involved in the process.

For instance, a parent comes to me and says her 3 year old son cannot recognize the difference between numbers and letters and blames the teacher for lack of instruction. I know, developmentally, that children do not tend to learn these things until age 4-5. I contact the teacher to see what lessons she is presenting to the children regarding numbers and letters. She shows me how she introduces them one at a time through a game. I do some research and find that new concepts must be presented at least 500 times to children 3-5 years old before a concept gets incorporated into their brains. I sit down with both the teacher and parent and present what is happening in the classroom and what I found in my research. We all agree to move ahead with the current lessons in class and have the mother also do some number and letter learning at home so that the child can progress developmentally.
