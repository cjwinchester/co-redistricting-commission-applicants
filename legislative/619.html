<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
When I served on the Board of Directors for Great Rock Water and Sanitation, I, along with the Board, had one goal, to provide clean drinking water to our neighbors for as little as possible, and looking forward to the future and future growth, to ensure water for future generations.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
To make a difference in the state I live, to ensure the borders are changed if needed in a fair and equal manner.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a Commissioner, it&#39;s important to represent the people and not ones self.  All voices should be heard and considered, each opinion deserves to be treated with respect, each person is important and should be treated as such. Being impartial can be difficult, but can be accomplished. Professionalism, integrity, honesty are standards that should be maintained by anyone who serves as a Commissioner.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My Father, a man with a ninth grade education, taught his sons that any problem can be solved if logic is applied. Good communication will serve as a tool to allow for the Commission to do their jobs in a fair manner. As an engineer, I was in constant discussions, searching for a bridge to allow all ideas to be blended to a solid solution. If you look at the world today, you see one that lacks in accountability, with people that cannot reason, people who have little respect for others. I feel I can be an asset, serving years in positions that require multiple personalities to agree to a final solution. The goal should be a solution that is fair to all residents of the State of Colorado.  We live in a State with many demographics, opinions and needs.  These should be equally represented.
