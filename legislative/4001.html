<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Since graduating law school in 2013, my political activity has primarily consisted of donating to progressive and Democratic candidates for elected office at state, local, and federal levels. Since November 10, 2015, I have donated to the Movement for Black Lives; Biden/Harris for President; and various other Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate races through ActBlue.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Asian Pacific American Bar Association of Colorado, Board Member, 2018-2019
Colorado Bar Association High School Mock Trial Program, Coach for La Academia High School, 2016-2018
Justice Sonia Sotomayor Inn of Court, Executive Committee Member and Treasurer, 2018-2019  
Rose Andom Center (a family justice center serving domestic violence victims), Young Professionals Council Member, 2017-2019
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My experience in this regard stems from my work for non-profit groups related to the Colorado legal community. First, as a former board member of the Asian Pacific American Bar Association of Colorado, I worked with fellow board members to solicit feedback from our membership regarding important issues affecting the AAPI community and communicate our members&#39; positions to state policy makers. Second, as a founding member of the Sonia Sotomayor Inn of Court (a non-profit organization aimed at providing mentorship for young lawyers and law students) I actively engaged new and junior Inn members to determine their specific mentorship and career planning needs and worked with senior Inn members to find ways to better serve these needs. Finally, as a former member of the Rose Andom Center&#39;s Young Professionals Council, I worked with my colleagues to fundraise for the Center and raise awareness of the Center as a central resource for domestic violence victims in Denver.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The redistricting process is of paramount importance to our representative democracy. By determining how voters are grouped for legislative districts, the redistricting process groups communities together (or splits them apart); impact which candidates win elections; and ultimately shapes the policies that are passed into law. Given its importance, I believe the redistricting process should be lead by citizens, not lawmakers who are naturally incentivized to draw lines to preserve or create partisan advantages. Moreover, I believe citizens, not politicians, should have the leading voice in considering the various factors relevant to redistricting, including racial equity, preserving communities, and maintaining competitiveness. I understand the importance of serving on this Commission and the difficulty of the task ahead. If selected, I would fully commit my time, energy, and capabilities to this project; and I would be proud to do this work for Colorado.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am confident in my ability to be a consensus-maker because I am driven by a sense of humility. If selected, I would focus on learning from fellow commissioners and other stakeholders and make every effort to understand the interests and rationale driving each position. By making a sincere effort to learn and understand, I believe I can build trust and empathy with fellow commissioners, which would enable effective consensus-building on contested issues.  

Additionally, I learned from working for two Justices of the Colorado Supreme Court that humility enables decisionmakers to be fair and impartial. My experience at the Court taught me that if a decisionmaker understands that s/he is in a position to learn from others, then s/he will be more likely to leave preexisting biases or prejudices at the door. Moreover, a decisionmaker that understands that a core part of his/her role is to learn from others is better equipped to objectively apply legal rules or criteria. If selected, I would apply these lessons from the Court to my work for the Commission.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Through my various legal jobs (judicial law clerk, litigator, and in-house counsel), I have developed two key skills that would allow me to be an effective problem solver on this Commission. First, I have become skilled at identifying the core of a particular problem. While problems often present as complex or multi-faceted, most problems I have encountered can be distilled to a core or set of core interests. For me, problem solving starts with asking the right questions and having effective front end discussions to identify the core; once the core properly identified, it becomes much easier to craft a practical solution. Second, I am skilled at alternating between big-picture and detail-oriented thinking. For many complex questions, problem solvers need to be able to bounce back-and-forth between two mindsets: they need to be comfortable diving into the weeds of an issue; at the same time, they need to understand the big picture and prevent minor details from impeding progress on big ideas. In my work, I frequently switch between these mindsets by evaluating the big picture implications of highly technical legal language. I am confident these skills will allow me to be an effective problem solver on the Commission.
