        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Cory Gaines</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Cory Gaines
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Cory Home Gaines</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a math and physics instructor at Northeastern Junior College.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a bachelors (CU) and masters (CSU) degree in physics.  I also completed the welding program at Pickens Technical School in Aurora, CO a long time ago (I was certified but it has lapsed).  I also maintain a CDL with tanker endorsement.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80751
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
My experience thus far has been mainly in contacting elected officials, unelected officials, and the media concerning issues that are of importance to me.  My main focus thus far has been in advocating for privacy rights and transparency in using cell phone data to track citizens&#39; movements, advocating for having the (once the initial emergency has been cleared) Colorado Assembly decide how to respond to pandemics rather than one man in the Governor&#39;s chair, and advocating for the rural parts of the state to have more of a voice in Colorado government.  I contact people via phone, via email, and have begun using social media as a way to contact officials and to reach directly through to people using my Facebook group Colorado Accountability Project.  I am also trying to encourage others to get involved by contacting their elected officials.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
This one will be brief.  My political activity is mostly recent.  I have, of course, voted in every election since I was eligible and try to do my due diligence on informing myself of the initiatives and etc. on the ballot, but it wasn&#39;t until recently (actually it was Gov Polis emergency declaration and state shutdown that spurred it) that I became more actively involved.  I have not ever, and do not plan to ever, donate money to any campaign, candidate, or political organization.  I have, however, spent a great deal of time emailing and talking to both elected and unelected people in the areas of interest to me in an effort to influence and change what I have seen happening lately in Colorado.  I have also (because the response rate from officials and the media can be dishearteningly small) begun to create groups and use social media to expand my reach and to go directly to people.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Outside of being a registered Libertarian since I first started voting, I am not a member of any political organizations.  I am not a member of any civic organizations or community organizations either.  Outside of commitments at my work (which wold be mostly internal committees like the Human Resources Leadership Committee) I am not a member of any other associations
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Quite simply, I want two things:  
1. I want rural Colorado to have more of a voice in Colorado politics and decision making.  I believe a thoughtful redistricting will help this.
2. I will be perfectly honest and say that I want to influence the districting.  I have no interest in political office, but I have been concerned at the direction things have taken of late and want to have a hand in shaping the future direction the state goes in.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am glad I’m coming upon this question a few years after I got married, because I believe being married has greatly shifted (for the better) my perspective on reaching consensus among two people who have strongly-held, opposite opinions.  If you’re also married, I’m sure you understand as well.  My experience thus far has taught me that promoting consensus or agreement starts by recognizing that people of good will can disagree, and that someone else not seeing things the way I do doesn&#39;t make them ignorant or careless or etc.   Starting from that point, I think consensus building or compromise takes the form of outlining why you feel the way you do, what your goals are, outlining what you can&#39;t live with, and then finding areas of agreement.  For the things that you cannot agree on, you return to what you can&#39;t live with, and start saying what you&#39;ll tolerate.  I think keeping in mind that the essence of good compromise means that you (and all other parties) will be a little unhappy helps too.  It keeps you focused on what a reasonable outcome will look like.
I would like to say that I’m perfect in regard to being impartial, but I cannot.  Being fair to others, however, is a big value of mine.  In my experience as a teacher, I have had numerous times where I’ve had a student that I didn’t like, or one that sent a nasty email to my boss, or some such.  I have then had the chance to catch that student in a “gotcha” situation—a situation where they’d broken some minor rule or forgotten a homework or some such.  I cannot tell you how good it would have felt to bring the hammer down, but if I allow everyone else one free mistake, I must allow the troublesome students the same grace--difficult as it is.  That’s plain fairness.  It’s how I would want to be treated.  As another example, you may have been able to read between the lines thus far and know that I disagree vehemently with many things that Gov Polis and others have done.  Perhaps not, but let me know make it explicitly clear.  I disagree vehemently with many of the policy decisions and actions that Polis and others have undertaken.  In my Facebook group posts (Colorado Accountability Project—you’re welcome to go see), I do my best in posting to not step outside the truth and to be fair.  For example, in a recent post (recent as I write this on 8/13), I wrote some notes on Polis taking grant money to fund some of his political priorities.  The very first thing I wrote is that it’s not illegal and he has not been the first governor to do so

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am not sure how to take the word “analytical” in your question; i.e. I am not sure if you mean analytical in terms of the ability to understand and parse an argument or position, or whether you mean analytical in the mathematical/statistical sense.  In either case I feel that I am well suited in this regard.  I did not take the road into academia, but most of my education has been along that line and I regularly work on learning new things in physics (which requires the ability to understand and break down mathematical/logical arguments and the ability to apply math to them).  I will be honest and tell you that my knowledge of some higher level statistics concepts is incomplete, but I learn quickly and don’t anticipate a problem.
As regards the second part of your question, I do not feel as though I will have an issue applying logic and reasoning to a problem.  When you go to solve a problem in physics or mathematics (especially once you are beyond the level of memorizing a formula and into the areas of novel study) that’s exactly what you do.  Interestingly, it’s also what you do when trying to fix something (I’m working on restoring a track loader and help my dad in his semi restorations) though perhaps with less or a different form of math.  I feel as though I am well practiced in this regard.
