        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for David Averill</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  David Averill
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am the Executive Director of the San Miguel Authority for Regional Transportation - a Regional Transportation Authority operating out of Telluride.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a BA from the University of Nebraska - Lincoln in Environmental Studies with minors in Sociology and English. I also have a Masters degree in Urban and Regional Planning with significant studies in Transportation Systems Planning and Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. Classes along the line included advanced demography, statistics, and economics. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81435
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I think the only the only applicable experience I have to this question is my experience with CASTA - the Colorado Association of Transit Agencies. As president of the Board of Directors of CASTA, I helped represent and advocate for literally every transit agency in the State. As a Board member, I have worked hard to ensure that the voice of every member agency of CASTA was represented in Board discussions and outside lobbying efforts. Its not always easy to maintain a balanced viewpoint that represented interests from all across the State but I think we do a pretty good job at CASTA. I think the fact that I have been elected to the CASTA Board for two terms now illustrates that my peers and colleagues from around the state (those who elect members of the Board) trust my intent, judgement, and ability to lead.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have never ran for any public office, volunteered for any campaign, participated in any party caucus, or donated to any political campaign.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
- no political organizations or party affiliation since 2007.
- Northstar HOA (my condo. owners association) board member.
- Current Board member and immediate past president, Colorado Association of Transit Agencies (CASTA)
- Board member, South West Association of Transit Agencies (SWTA)
- appointed Board member, San Miguel County Open Space Commision
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As an unaffiliated voter in Colorado, I have found limited opportunities to be involved in politics beyond simply voting. I believe that the legislative redistricting commission has an amazing opportunity to ensure that Colorado&#39;s legislative districts serve as an honest reflection of those who live in them, without the partisan gerrymandering we&#39;ve seen over so many years. I would be extremely honored to be entrusted with a role on the legislative re-districting Commission and believe its work will have a lasting impact on the State - for the better.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As an unafilliated voter, I see the pluses (and negatives) of both sides of our traditional political &quot;aisle&quot;. As an executive leader with a proven track record working in the public sector with and on behalf of varied communities, I am always striving for consensus and agreement in difficult conversations. This can only be done by being fair and impartial - even in difficult or stressful conversations. I have found (for better or worse - and not always to my pleasure) that I am a natural leader when it comes to pulling groups together to develop mutually beneficial solutions. This has been confirmed by some work over the years with professional coaches and assessments such as Hogan Lead and Hogan Challenge - I&#39;d be happy to share the results of those assessments if anyone wanted to see them. How do I do it? I&#39;m just myself - no bull. I&#39;m also a pretty nice guy who people respect and want to work with - even if they need to give a little. I am always looking for the win-win and my track records supports this.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As an urban planner with a background in systems engineering, I am a data driven decision maker. That&#39;s not to say that I&#39;m blind to community values and motivations, or that I&#39;m not politically savvy - because I am. As the Executive Director of one of Colorado&#39;s six regional transportation authorities, all of my decisions and recommendations are transparent, based in logic, and made with the best interests of the communities I serve in mind. I think this mindset and skillset will serve me well if I am fortunate enough to be appointed to this Commission.
