<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I’ve been community organizing for a large part of my life. My love for community stems from my parents, they were always heavily involved in all aspects of our community life. Coaching soccer, active and involved members of the Catholic church, and most importantly heavily involved in our education. Both my parents, although immigrants to this country, chose to be role models for myself and my siblings of what Public Servants can look like. As a child, I volunteered heavily with them, always using my privilege of being bilingual to help others navigate the sometimes monolingual world. As a teenager, I was involved in athletics, theatre, and school clubs; Leos Club, Key Club, Social Justice Club, National Honor Society, etc. As a college student, I was a member of the Student Senate for California Community Colleges, President of the Associated Student Body, active member of various student groups, and named Woman of the Year by my peers while working on campus and attending school. 

As a mother, I have only become more engaged with my community, because now I too, have little eyes watching me. My oldest is on the Autism spectrum, as a bilingual mother, I credit my access to resources in a language I understood as being a source of aid for my child. I worked with other non-native English speaking mothers to create a support group for us so that we could share information and help each other navigate the world of special needs. That also was a source of my commitment to helping fund Padres Lideres Latinos, a Spanish version of our PTA. This group not only raised funds for their school but donated that money to a resource center helping our parents affected during the pandemic. 

My youngest is what I can only describe as fierce. She is demanding, attentive, loving, intelligent, and kind- I imagine she will be a leader in her own space one day. I am inspired to work harder and reach farther into my community for the future of both of my children, and those who are growing alongside them. 

That commitment to my children and my community also led me to run for School Board last year, and therefore officially becoming the first woman of color and Latina to win elected office not only in my school district but also in my county.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As a rural Colorado resident, my story is not unique to the lived experiences in our valleys. I am the proud daughter of immigrants, a first-generation college graduate, a neighbor to the DREAMER, and the American Veteran. I live in a community where the environment, the wildlife, and oil is sacred. As is honoring those whose land we now live on. Rural Colorado breeds diversity. 

I have been blessed with experiences that have greatly highlighted the need for fair maps in our state and communities. My time as a volunteer with the Salvation Army came during the Lake Christine Fire in Basalt, Co. A fire that impacted 2 counties, one of which was a whole mountain over. The residents of the small sliver in Eagle county on this side of the valley have been directly impacted by unfair districts. Their drive to their municipality makes it near impossible to get necessary services, let alone, actual resources. I have worked closely with Eagle county through my work, especially during the initial stages of COVID, and have seen how frustrating it&#39;s been not only for the residents on this side of the mountain but the county staff who are trying so hard to connect with them. As a school board member, my school district is represented by 3 counties. During our initial conversations on returning to school, the one issue we continued to be hit with was which county data we would be following. As a bilingual leader in my community, when a family asks for assistance, I have to know where they live first to help direct them. 

I understand how gerrymandering can impact how we as residents live day to day. This commission gives us an opportunity to not only be fair and just, but be intentional about how we shape our communities, and how and what we provide to its residents. It would be a great honor to be a part of this commission focused on equity, equality, and true representation for all Colorado residents. 

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Part of my work in serving on a 5 person board is the conversation about being able to dialogue on issues, share lived experiences, and be honest so that we can come to a unified response. It doesn&#39;t always have to be easy, just as long as it remains respectful and honest. Shared and lived experience are what make teams and conversations moving forward stronger. Relationships matter, but you earn that through trust and mutual respect. It may seem difficult in today&#39;s climate to have hard conversations around what may currently seem like contentious issues, but the reality is that those conversations must happen in order for our communities to move forward. 

As a board member, it is often difficult to represent all our constituents&#39; diverse opinions because they are so incredibly diverse. But it is very important to make sure all their voices are heard, validated, and then use that combined with our understanding, knowledge, lived experience, and details provided, to make the best decision possible for all of them.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
The nonprofit I and other Latino community leaders founded a couple of months into COVID highlights the need for “a tri-county region where [leaders] are thriving, engaged, and leading in all of our communities.” My job within our organization is to create programming that helps empower and support our leaders to lead in the spaces they are in. That includes leading 3 different leadership programs, brainstorming what they can potentially look like, collaborating with partners to achieve the goals for my programs, and staying within my budget.

In order to achieve my goals for programs I also need to understand data. And nonprofits like ours need data. Intentional research using data can create avenues for you to reach your goals more effectively. Something I strive to achieve through all our programs. Our team uses this for consensus building, and I use it with my team as we move forward in our leadership work. We have a high standard of requirements for our data collection, this improves not only the quality of the research but the story the data is telling. It is imperative that we function as professionals, and that what we do is seen as thorough so that we can not only have a consensus as a team but unity in front of the community.
