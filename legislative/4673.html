<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am actively involved in politics and take a keen interest in educating myself about the issues on the ballot, the daily local and international news. I have always been interested in political science and love to dialogue with all sides and parties. It is one of my pleasures in life to learn how people feel about politics and how they relate to their wishes, dreams, desires and general quality of life.

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
A teacher is trained to consider the interests of all ethnic, socio-economic and educational levels that comprise their student body.  My character of empathy, patience and adaptability was built by twenty years of teaching middle and high school students. I taught biology at Telluride Mountain School and was a field biology instructor in remote field sites for Telluride&#39;s Living Classroom. I have taken groups of students on experiential field trips to Hawaii and Costa Rica which required outstanding organizing skills on all levels. I learned the art of coaching as the instructor Telluride High School Knowledge Bowl team, and mentored farm to table agrarian classes at the Telluride Grow Dome. I have worked with elders and kindergarten students by hosting astronomical star parties for the The Telluride Academy.  I co-produced the Telluride MountainFilm festival New Guinea Symposium with an international team of biologists, ethnologists, native Papua New Guineans, musicians and politicians. This was an extraordinary chance to showcase to the attendants of this world renowned festival, my ability to represent and advocate for the conservation and understanding of the people, the culture and the wildlife of this biodiverse island. I have also been an active and caring board member of Southern Plains Land Trust located in southeastern Colorado for nearly ten years. My work to conserve the last great swaths of the shortgrass prairie that once made up a third of our state has been a huge component of my life. I have been a vital link to our board providing my scientific background to help SPLT better manage the land that comprise our vast reserves. I help organize our bi-yearly fundraising galas which are often held at the History Colorado Museum. As the executive director of Telluride&#39;s Pinhead Institute I brought over 20 international scientists to present their research to my Colorado community.  I have currently host monthly star gazing sessions at the Telluride Library where I let folks peer through my telescope and ponder the wonders of our universe. I am actively involved in a revegetation project on the Telluride Valley floor open space.  I have co-produced and hosted a radio show with my daughter. It is broadcast as Voices of the Valley Floor-a and Fauna on our local radio station, KOTO...we describe local wildlife intrigues to listeners in San Miguel County. As an alternate representative of the Rocky Flats Public Health Advocates nonprofit advocating for the health of all citizens.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I&#39;m a Colorado native. I grew up a suburban cowgirl and rode my Appaloosa horse along Wheat Ridge&#39;s Clear Creek GreenBelt and Crown Hill Open Space Park. From elementary through high school I moved my pony from one pasture to the next, each pasture converted to a new subdivision. I took my little spotted horse with me to CSU where I studied biology.  Between my organic chem and biology classes, I rode her along Prospect Avenue on my way to Horsetooth Reservoir. Thousands of trail and city riding miles (I tied my horse outside Avogadro&#39;s Number in Fort Collins) infused Colorado into my soul.  I love its natural beauty, I love the vivacious towns and cities that make Colorado unique. I adore the opportunities we have to enjoy the great outdoors no matter whether one lives in Denver with its beautiful city parks and views of the front range, or Rocky Ford with its Arkansas River, or Telluride with its majestic San Juan Mountains box canyon, or Cortez in the shadow of Mesa Verde and the canyon country....this state is extraordinarily blessed.  On that note, I would love the opportunity to serve my state and to sit on this exciting new commission. It would be honored to be on the breaking edge of a change in the paradigm of the archaic gerrymandering system.  I would like to learn how our districts were created and how we can make them more representative of the diversities in our population and most importantly how we can fairly draw lines that are representative of Colorado&#39;s voting demographics.  Plus, it would just be plain fascinating to go through this process and learn a whole lot more about Colorado, its people, counties, districts, demographics and its legislation! 
 

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I would promote consensus through my understanding and interpretation of the data presented to us in the meetings, though my careful consideration of the 2020 census data, through dialoguing with and understanding my fellow commissioners thoughts, through reading the available literature and doing my own research, and through careful self-examination that any biases I may have be carefully weighed and realized in the light of trying to accommodate all the people of Colorado.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a published biologist, I have worked with large data sets. I have taken statistics and run ANOVA analysis on my own biological data. I work with spread sheets in Excel regularly as a teacher. My ability to apply logic is something I work on daily! It is an ever evolving process for me. I read constantly and have become extremely interested in the logic of politics through this last election cycle...always reaching for the truth of science and the light of reason to help me to solve a problem.
