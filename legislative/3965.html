<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In 2020, I volunteered for the Colorado Democrats Voter Protection Hotline. I was concerned that for the General Election held on November 3, there would be external issues and forces impacting our election integrity. As an attorney I felt it was my civic duty to volunteer to help answer questions if voters had problems with such things as mail ballots not received, voter registration, voter intimidation, and other problems that created a barrier to voting.

John Hickenlooper for Senate (CO) 
Beto for Senate (TX)
Roger Manno for Congress (MD) 
Hillary for President

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
National Associations of Telecommunications Officers &amp; Advisors, Board Member 2016-2020
Maryland State Bar Association, Member

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have not participated in such activities outside of professional work organizations since I moved to Colorado in 2015. As a single Mom and pre-COVID, most of my spare time was focused on my daughter’s activities (now 16) which included year-round soccer with travel clubs and school teams. I did assist with team support (snacks, rides, etc) for my daughter’s soccer teams.  

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
One of the reasons that I registered as an unaffiliated voter in Colorado when I moved here from Maryland in July of 2015, was that I was completely turned off by party politics. 
For many years when I lived in Maryland, I participated in legislative and political activities including campaign politics. In 2006-2008, I worked for Congressman Albert Wynn, a centrist Democrat who spent his career crossing party lines to collaborate and work with Republicans on compromise solutions. Mr. Wynn was beaten in the 2008 primary by a challenger that attacked him for working with Republicans and voting for bills that weren’t “progressive” enough even though they contained critical items that helped his constituents. That same year, many of Mr. Wynn’s centrist colleagues lost their seats to challengers from the extreme left and extreme right. I found this to be extremely disheartening.
A few years later, following the 2010 Census, the Maryland General Assembly engaged in some of the most egregious gerrymandering in the Country. The legislature redrew the Congressional maps and contorted districts in ways that made no sense for the sole goal of ousting the 2 Republican members of Congress. For example, my house was located in a suburban community just outside the District of Columbia; yet, this new map placed me in a legislative district with rural western Maryland communities. In addition, the Maryland General Assembly also gerrymandered the State Legislative Districts in order to preserve power in the City of Baltimore. These maps created a great amount of confusion and damaged relationships between constituents and elected officials. As a result, these maps were challenged in Court and even went to the Supreme Court. 
Over the last twenty years, party politics has become even more divisive. This all or nothing approach of the parties is harming our country. Which is why I was positively elated when Colorado voters passed the referendum to allow the State to create a non-partisan commission to determine redistricting. Redistricting maps should be fair and impartial. It is critically important to draw the districts in ways that remove political bias. In addition to my political and legislative experience, I also have professional experience that directly relates to mapping and developing nonpartisan relationships to solve problems. 
I am an attorney that works in the telecommunications industry. One of our industry’s biggest challenges is finding efficient ways to connect rural unserved and underserved communities with high-speed broadband. 
In my field, mapping is a big issue. For example, existing internet providers must on a biannual basis, self-report the census blocks where they provide coverage. If a provider serves one household in a census block, then that entire census block is considered served. For many years national broadband maps that have been created have been heavily criticized for over-estimate existing coverage since they are reliant on providers to self-report and there is no mechanism for quality control. 
The issue with these maps is that they are often used by federal and state granting authorities to justify funding awards. For example, a grant applicant is usually ineligible to apply for a census block if the maps show it is currently being served by another provider. It can be very difficult for grant applicants to prove a negative and/or create a network design that complies with the funding requirements. 
In the last 10 years, I have worked with many diverse communities (including in Colorado) on resolving mapping issues and developing network plans that serve as many households and locations within a census block as possible. My background in telecommunications would provide the Commission with a unique perspective on mapping.
It would be a great honor for me to leverage my experience and to be able to serve the people of Colorado in helping to draw fair and unbiased redistricting maps. 

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Over the last seven years in my professional career, I have primarily worked in rural broadband finding solutions for communities than need better internet access. As a part of my job, I traveled to many different communities in the most rural parts of our country to conduct stakeholder outreach, talk to members of the community including school officials, public safety officials, health professionals, business leaders, elected officials and more. This required me to listen and understand everyone’s perspective in order to generate a broadband plan with multiple solutions that met the needs of the community. 

In most cases, I would present the plan and recommendations to planning commissions and city councils. One thing I have learned is overwhelmingly broadband is not a Democrat versus Republican issue. In most cases, whether or not the community adopted my recommendation came down to funding and financing, and whether they could develop partnerships with a private provider to assist them in the deployment and operations of a network. 

While I traveled around the country, most of my time was spent working with Colorado communities including Pitkin County, Routt County, Towns of Fraser and Winter Park, Town of Breckenridge, City of Greeley, City of Louisville, City of Thornton, Town of Erie, City of Littleton and Town of Firestone. This enabled me to gain a deep understanding of these communities, their geography, broadband maps and perspectives. 

In addition, for the last four years, I served on the Board of Directors of the National Association of Telecommunications Officers and Advisors (NATOA). NATOA’s members come from the largest cities and smallest towns across the country. One of NATOA’s biggest challenges is finding ways to meet the needs of all members. The last two years, I served on the Annual Conference Committee and co-chaired the Policy and Legal Committee, and I can tell you that issues that impact one city may not impact all, and it was challenging to walk that fine line across the membership. 

Overall, I have a deep understanding of the Colorado landscape and years of experience working with diverse groups of people with diverging opinions. I often speak on panels at national conferences and would not have achieved professional success without taking a collaborative and equitable approach to everything that I do.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As you can see from my attached curriculum vitae (cv), I have spent my entire career working in jobs that require the application of logic, reasoning, analytical, critical thinking and communication skills. This includes extensive experience with understanding federal, state and local telecommunications issues, application of legal and regulatory rules and regulations, team-building, strategic planning, project management for large complex projects, engagement in public policy, government affairs, lobbying and public speaking.

In my current position as Director, Commercial &amp; Market Development with Render Networks I serve as in-house counsel for a dynamic software as a service technology company with a geo-spatial digital construction management platform based in Melbourne, Australia. I also serve on the Executive Leadership Team of the Company which includes developing budgets, priorities, setting objectives and leading indicators and strategic planning.
