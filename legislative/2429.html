<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am a student of our democratic process and enjoy learning about our democracy.  I feel a responsibility to encourage others to get involved.  Serving on the Redistricting Commission would expose me to an area of elections that I have not previously been involved in.  Coincidentally, I have been involved in the planning of the last two Census cycles through Denverâ€™s Complete Count Committee.  It would be fascinating to see how our Census impacts the redistricting process.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have over a decade of professional experience working with diverse political interests (Republicans, Democrats and Independents) to build coalitions and explore policy synergies.   I have also traveled to numerous counties across Colorado and have been active in Democratic Party politics for several years.  I believe I have the experience, objectivity and communication skills to be helpful on the Redistricting Commission.  I am also a proud Coloradan and spent my childhood on the Western Slope before moving to Denver around the time I started the 4th Grade.  I also come from a family with diverse ideological interests that are registered in both political parties.  I believe the breadth of my personal, professional and political experiences will allow me to see each commissioner&#39;s perspective with a unique lens.  I am confident that I will be able to engage in a respectful dialogue with all of the commissioners as we work through the difficult task of redistricting.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Over the course of my entire career, I have had to rely on my ability to analyze data, assess facts and piece together solutions.  my analytical skills were honed in the private sector working in the IT and telecommunications industry where all of my teams were data driven. My skills were further advanced though policy work as a public affairs executive over the last decade. I enjoy a great challenge and rely on teamwork to achieve solutions.
