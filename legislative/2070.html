<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
None, have not donated to campaigns or political organizations
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Periodically volunteer for church activities.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have presented leadership seminars for Colorado government associations at annual meetings (CFMA, CIMA and CSMA) to improve leadership skills of Colorado government managers


</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have effectively served numerous federal government administrations in my over 35 years of federal service. After retiring as a senior executive from the federal government, I had the honor of being asked to facilitate the Census Bureau senior executives, responsible for the 2020 Census, in developing their strategy of action for the recently concluded decennial census. After that experience, and my successful 35+ federal government career, I feel extremely qualified to facilitate competing interests in achieving consensus on important topics such as redistricting. I also continue to feel a need to provide service to the public, based on all this country and Colorado has provided me.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have successfully dealt with contentious public issues in my role as a federal government manager and senior executive. I led actions to clean-up the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant by developing both the Strategic Plan for closure and the Future Site Use Plan for the facility with public, environmental and political input. These efforts included an extraordinary number of engagements with the public, local, federal and state government officials to reach consensus on the closure actions. As an senior executive, I led a very dangerous mission to destroy Syria&#39;s deadly chemical weapon&#39;s stockpile, where I negotiated with not only senior administration officials, but executives from numerous agencies to successfully accomplish a mission some said could not be done safely. Politically, I am an unaffiliated voter who chooses the best candidates and actions based on merit. My federal career involved working for both major political parties and I always worked to achieve the best possible outcomes for all involved.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Besides my engineering and management degrees, I have led organizations responsible for extremely hazardous operations, where detailed analytical and logic skills were used routinely to deal with a multitude of issues (people, technical, legal, environmental) to accomplish hazardous work and maintain employee safety. I was the lead senior executive for the Department of Defense&#39;s primary laboratory responsible for developing equipment to protect our military from deadly chemical and biological weapons. I managed over 1450 scientists, engineers and technicians, in over 100 facilities, who on a daily basis handled the most deadly compounds known to mankind (nerve agent, anthrax, etc.). Many times even routine issues could have resulted in injury or death to employees but analyzing problems, creating options and arriving at solutions was our way of work. Also, while working as a manager at Rocky Flats, I was able to obtain public and local political consensus on the proposed future site use of the land, after most parties in the effort were ready to quit the group. I appealed to everyone&#39;s sense of responsibility to future generations of Colorado citizens to effectively gain consensus with the effort. I also led one of the federal government&#39;s primary leadership development centers and taught hundreds of career government managers how to effectively lead during any administration through facilitation, coaching and consensus building.
