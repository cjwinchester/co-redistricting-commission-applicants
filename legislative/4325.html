        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Yolanda Calderon</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Yolanda Calderon
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Yolanda Calderon</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a music teacher at Wheeling Elementary in Aurora Public Schools, Kindergarten through 5th grade currently a mix of online and in person. This year I am completing my 10th year of teaching and I am very excited to stay in the profession. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I received a Bachelor in Music Performance and a Bachelor in Music education from Metropolitan State University in 2010. I have been active and dedicated to the study of music all through my education which is why I continue to teach music to this day.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80218
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I think since I turned 18 I may have missed only one or two elections. I really feel that voting is a great way to start getting involved in the democratic process. I also volunteered on various ballot issues from bond and mills to referendum C and D. I want to become more involved so I can continue to share the idea that we are all in charge or protecting democracy.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am the Vice President of the Aurora Education Association, member of AEA Bargaining Team. I serve on the National Education Association and Colorado Education Association resolutions committee. I am also a member of the steering committee of Coloradoans for the Common good which is a non partisan coalition of faith leaders, labor unions and other organizations dedicated to making democracy work.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As the Vice President of a labor union organizing is where I shine. During several elections from ballot initiatives to school board I have been able to organize dozens of teachers and motivate them to hit the streets and knock on doors. I also serve on the National Education Association Resolutions Committee which is a the group that writes, edits, and maintain the foundational documents for our union. When I represent at the national level I have to consider the positions of Colorado and represent those perspectives at the national level even if they are different from my personal views. Rallying people to move forward on a project and being able to balance my personal views with others is a strength I can bring to this commission.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I think voting is so important and I want our elections to be fair and truly representative of the will of Colorado. As a state we are an example of how elections should be run and how mail in ballots can be safe an effective way to engage citizens in the democratic process. I also think this commission can be another shining example about how Coloradoans can put their heads together, work collaboratively and come up with solutions to important issues that affect our state. Our legislative districts for the next 10 years is vital to the operations of our state and how our voice is elevated nationally. I know that I can work with a wide variety of people and can help in uplifting Colorado as an example for the nation on how to elect and work together for the common good.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a member of the AEA Bargaining Team I represent a diverse membership and it is my job to understand the will of the membership and negotiate to meet their needs. There have been several times during negotiations when I have had to move forward with an idea that I personally may not have wanted to push forward. An example of that was our districts recent decision to have &quot;hard to staff&quot; stipends for certain teaching positions. Personally I am very much against this idea as I think we should all get paid equally by our tenure and education. However, it was the will of the membership that this idea move forward. Not only did I advocate to that end but I joined a group of AEA members and APS leadership to come up with rules around those stipends and how they will be assessed to make sure they stay true to the initial intention behind this shift in compensation.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
A skill that is overlooked that is strengthened through the performing arts are real time problem solving skills. If you consider when you are performing with a 90 piece orchestra we can&#39;t just throw on the brakes I makes a mistake. I have to asses a lot visually and aurally in seconds to fix the issue because there are another 89 people depending on me to do it. One thing I know for certain is currently we are in a dynamic time and I have the ability to stop on a dime and change course if it means that we can move forward together. I am a native to this state and I want to see Colorado continue to be shining example for the country on how to move forward together.
