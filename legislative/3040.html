        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Jane Hummer</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Jane Hummer
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Managing Consultant at Guidehouse. I have worked with this group since 2004 under different organization names due to two acquisitions (previous company names: Summit Blue Consulting and Navigant Consulting). 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  BA in English, Bowdoin College, 2003
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80304
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have participated in general GOTV work as a precinct captain and/or poll watcher in the 2004, 2006, and 2008 elections. I helped organize two large Clean Tech for Obama fundraisers in 2008 which raised tens of thousands of dollars. I have made small donations to various Democratic campaigns (most recently Biden, Warren, Clinton, a general ActBlue fund for key 2020 Senate races, etc.) and non-profits such as EFAA, Boulder Food Rescue, Planned Parenthood, Human Rights Campaign, Habitat for Humanity, etc. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I served on the board of the local chapter of the Association of Energy Services Professionals recently. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I advocate for and consider the interests of Coloradans through researching and writing opinion pieces about Boulder and state politics for the Daily Camera, where I&#39;m a member of the Community Editorial Board. I&#39;m an active participant in local social media groups on Nextdoor and Facebook, where I enjoy discussing community issues with my neighbors. I attend many local city council meetings and city events in Boulder and participate in public comment periods and public engagement surveys on issues such as housing justice, homelessness policy, bike infrastructure, and other local issues that I feel strongly about. I enjoy engaging in the local arena and look forward to getting more involved in state-level issues in the future.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am excited by the intellectual challenge posed by redistricting and the opportunity to help shape fair elections in the future. Serving on this commission would allow me to apply the analytical and communications skills I&#39;ve developed in my professional life to a topic that I&#39;m very passionate about: participation in our democracy. I love the state of Colorado and I would relish the chance to travel throughout the state, hold hearings with fellow citizens, learn more about the regional variations in demographics and political priorities, and work with others to develop a redistricting plan that would serve the people of Colorado well for the next decade. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am a registered Democrat, but I believe the goal of the Democrats on the redistricting commission should not be to design districts that favor Democrats but rather to design districts in which competitive elections allow candidates and voters to participate in the marketplace of ideas and in which citizens are not dissuaded from voting because they believe their vote will never matter. My goal would be to form productive, collaborative relationships with all of my fellow commissioners and to advocate for my viewpoints using persuasion and data, not name-calling or temper tantrums. I am not a pushover, but I don&#39;t like wasting my time on pointless arguments; one of my guiding principles is &quot;Don&#39;t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.&quot; I have developed active listening techniques through my experience conducting qualitative research, and in particular I am good at helping others identify the roots of misunderstandings and build on even the narrowest areas of common ground.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a consultant with a focus on program and policy evaluation, I have developed strong data science skills as well as expertise in qualitative research (in-depth interviews, focus groups, etc.), and I believe both quantitative and qualitative research are essential to making important decisions such as the ones that this commission will make. It&#39;s very important to make decisions that are supported by the data, but humans are the still the ones deciding about which data to look at, and qualitative research helps identify blind spots or biases held by the decision-makers as a result of their lived experiences. As a white, able-bodied, cisgender, English-speaking American citizen, just to name a few of my many privileges, I recognize the importance of seeking out perspectives that differ from my own. I believe in applying the equity lens to policy analysis to ensure that one group of people isn&#39;t bearing all the costs while another group reaps all the rewards. 

In my work, I frequently conduct qualitative research by interviewing key stakeholders (policymakers, program staff, ordinary people affected by a program or policy, etc.) to understand the background and context of their experiences and to challenge any preconceptions that I might have about the subject matter, and then I develop a program theory and logic model to visually document the intentions for how the policy or program&#39;s interventions will logically lead to the expected outcomes. I then turn those cause-and-effect relationships into testable hypotheses and develop a research plan for quantitative research (e.g., database analysis, surveys, etc.) to test those hypotheses. I have expertise in statistics, sampling, data management, and analysis using R, SPSS, and GIS. I believe my approach to problem solving is thorough, ethical, and defensible. 

The most rigorous analyses are useless if they can&#39;t be communicated clearly in a manner that inspires confidence in the methodology and results. I have a background in technical writing and a talent for data visualization and storytelling through dashboards and presentations. I am frequently brought into projects to help communicate complex, technical analyses to less technical audiences.
