<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I have been serving on the City of Fruita’s Parks and Recreation Advisory Board for several years where I have worked to represent the interests of all of the City’s constituents. Over the past year, the City has been engaged in a strategic planning process for a new master plan to direct the Parks and Recreation Department for the next ten years. The City’s demographics and socio/economic layout looks much different from 10 years ago, requiring thoughtful and critical thinking into how the City can best serve all interests. I was engaged in the hiring process for the consultant developing the plan, as well as in the potential outcomes and objectives for the plan that is currently still being developed. I have raised concerns regarding gaps in not getting citizen feedback from underserved and minority groups in the community as well as highlighting areas for improvement for people with disabilities and youth engagement. 

I have also been a youth mountain bike coach and mentor for several years, particularly for young girls. Through various after school programs, I have taught skills in confidence, team work, environmental stewardship and leadership through the sport of mountain biking, bridging lessons learned on the trail to future young adults versed in being respectful and confident.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the commission because I have a diverse background in being an impartial and fair voice for a multitude of user groups and constituents and I believe that I could fulfill the role of a commissioner well for all of Colorado. I was a Park Ranger for Colorado Parks and Wildlife for ten years requiring me to be a certified Colorado Peace Officer and uphold the law in a nonbiased manner. I took my oath very seriously and treated all people with respect and dignity, striving to find common sense solutions to the various challenges I faced. This held true with the park management side of the job as well where I worked to address the needs of all park user groups.  I worked all over the State of Colorado, affording me the opportunity to truly get to know and appreciated the diverse makeup of our state. 

I also served as a Regional Representative for US Senator Michael Bennet, covering six counties across the western slope. I was a representative for all constituents, regardless of political background and I worked to ensure all voices were heard. I was a constituent advocate first and foremost and I came to understand the various challenges and opportunities that each individual, community and county faced. Finally, I now work for a nonprofit focused on river restoration in the west for the benefit of the multitude of communities who rely on them. I help to facilitate complex conversations with many user groups, figuring out ways to collaborate and work together to promote restoration work. 

Through all of my professional experience, I have also always found ways to become involved with the various local communities I have lived in. Civic engagement is incredibly important to me and I would truly be honored to be able to serve on a larger scale to be able to put my experience at a local and regional level to work for the benefit of the entire State of Colorado. 

Colorado is embarking on a historic process to ensure fair and equal representation in our state, paving a path for the next ten years. This is an incredibly important task so gerrymandering does not occur and all of our Congressional and Legislative districts are mapped in an impartial and fair manner. As an active citizen in the State’s democratic process, I am thrilled that Colorado is moving this forward. 

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I will promote consensus among the commissioners by first and foremost being an active listener and respecting all opinions and perspectives, while keeping the main objective in mind. Diverse ideas and experiences are truly a strength when trying to find an outcome that will serve a multitude of people in a large geographic area. As a Regional Representative for Senator Bennet, I led a serious of health care roundtables throughout the western slope. The opinions and emotions at these meetings were highly contentious and I would lay out the ground rules of being respectful and allowing anyone who wanted to speak to have the floor.  Being empathetic to individual experiences was truly key, but the follow up and asking clarifying questions so the entire group could understand where the person was coming from was even more important. Getting to the ‘why’ and talking through this allowed for civil discourse. 

As an Associate Director for a nonprofit, I oversee a group of professional staff from various backgrounds, working in various geographic areas across Colorado and Arizona. I lead large, grant development projects, where often times, staff have very different opinions on what the project components should like, who to engage and collaborate with, whether or not the project promotes the long-term strategic plan and how much risk should be taken.  I ensure that all staff are first and foremost engaged and participate in every planning discussion. I also make sure everyone has a chance to articulate their thoughts, being respectful to differing personalities and learning styles and trying to make the atmosphere comfortable. This allows me to sift through a possible project outline by treating everyone fairly, and through open dialogue, also making sure we are staying true to the intended outcome. 

Through my background in law enforcement and park management, as a representative for a US Senator and as a leader for a nonprofit organization working with a diverse group of staff, stakeholders, as well as my involvement with the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board, I have been afforded the opportunity to learn and excel in various environments as a sensible, fair and unbiased leader. 

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have a variety of analytical skills that I use in my current job as an Associate Director for a nonprofit. I oversee all of the programs within the organization, each of which have different staff and partners who are involved, and unique grant funding and fundraising associated with them. On a small scale, I am the project manager for all of the secured grants at any given time, requiring me to track budgets, reporting, meeting deliverables and ensuring contracting is in place and payments occur in a timely fashion. I then look beyond secured funding, working with a fundraising coordinator to strategically plan for current funding gaps and look to how to fund future needs with the direction of the programs. From an organizational perspective, I ensure that each program is running successfully and in line with the current strategic plan. Often times, I analyze budgets both short term and long term to assess sustainability and whether or not it makes sense to continue with certain program aspects or divert to other opportunities both in terms of potentially diversifying funding, and providing additional professional development opportunities for staff.

The creative analytical skills that I am able to utilize at the nonprofit has been extremely rewarding for me. I really enjoy thinking outside of the box and I am a big picture thinker. If something doesn’t make sense as to why or how we are doing something, I am not afraid to ask the difficult questions as to why and look for other solutions.  My team was having a difficult time keeping track of so many disparate grant budgets so I researched possible solutions. I organized and talked with various consultants and integrated a budget tracking system into a grant management program we were already utilizing. 

Finally, I have strong communication skills. I help guide and lead various collaborative, watershed groups throughout the southwest, from small place-based groups to large multi- state, regional collaboratives. These groups are built on consensus building and are at various stages in their lifespan- some have been around for over a decade and some are just getting started. I help staff and partners think through intended outcomes and objectives, create strong meeting agendas, and navigate discussions, helping to keep them on task.
