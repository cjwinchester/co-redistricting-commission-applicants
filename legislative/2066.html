        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Jerome Tinianow</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Jerome Tinianow
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Jerry Tinianow</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am self-employed through my single-member LLC. I am the proprietor of Western Urban Sustainability Advisors, LLC.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  BA with a double major in public and international affairs, George Washington University. JD from George Washington University. Admitted to practice law in Ohio (but not Colorado).
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80209
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
As Denver&#39;s first Chief Sustainability Officer (2012-19) I dealt with many advocacy groups and neighborhood associations, but as a city official I could not engage in organizing, representing or advocating for them. I did a lot of work of that type before moving to Colorado in 2012, but you are asking about work in Colorado.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Since Nov. 10, 2015, I have donated to (a) the presidential campaigns of Michael Bennett and Joe Biden, (b) the senatorial campaign of Alice Madden, (c) the congressional campaigns of James Iacino and Diane Mitsch Bush, and (d) the mayoral campaign of Michael B. Hancock. I did grassroots volunteer work for Mayor Hancock and VP Biden. I have have not donated to or otherwise participated in any state legislative campaigns, which is why I am applying for the state legislative redistricting commission rather than the congressional commission. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
U.S. Green Building Council; Urban Sustainability Directors Network; ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability; the Sierra Club (life member); Advisory Council member of the CU Denver business school Managing for Sustainability program; Denver Radio Club (for amateur radio operators), West Washington Park Neighborhood Association
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have long felt that there should be few if any &quot;safe districts&quot;, reflecting the fact that I have been registered as an Independent (&quot;unaffiliated&quot; in Colorado) since 2003. I believe that districts should be compact, regular in shape and configuration, and not designed to favor one party or the other. Serving on this commission would give me an opportunity to see if I can carry this preference into actual practice.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Regarding fairness and impartiality, I have extensive experience serving as a court-appointed mediator and arbitrator. Professionally as both a non-profit executive and as a former public official I have put the techniques used as a mediator to use in many different settings. As just one example, in Ohio I chaired a two-year community based risk assessment and strategic planning project by appointment of the Mayor of Columbus, involving 200 volunteers. We agreed at the outset that all decisions would be made by consensus. Despite the wide variety of stakeholders represented in that group, we were able to reach consensus on the identification and ranking of risks, and over 150 recommendations on how that city should address them. I have had little involvement with the Colorado General Assembly, which in this setting I believe would actually contribute to my ability to be fair and impartial. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Whether as a practicing attorney (22 years), a non-profit executive (9 year), or as a public official (7 years), I have had to bring substantial skills to bear in multiple disciplines. Much of this work has involved logic and reason. I learned as a trial attorney and as a mediator, however, that you cannot limit yourself to logic and reason; feelings and emotions must be considered and accommodated as well. The key to a successful outcome, particularly one based more on consensus than on majority rule, it to balance both types of reasoning.
