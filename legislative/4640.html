<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I grew up involved in politics in Iowa. I spent a half of my senior year of high school working in the Iowa Statehouse. I was Governor Terry E Branstad&#39;s (R) Page. I learned the structure of the statehouse - the State Reps and the State Senators, legislation, lobbyist, and citizens. It was a good place to learn about the value of representation of all the citizens of the state. Teaching the rule, that all politics are local, and the State Capitol is where you should find the citizen legislator. I had the advantage of working for the Governor and watching how to negotiate a Democrat controlled State Senate and a Republican controlled State House. Legislation for the state must be passed and enacted each Session, going beyond politics. 

I worked in Congressman Jim Leach&#39;s Office (IA-R) as his Legislative Assistant for Agriculture and Economic policy in DC. I worked for a Congressman who was known for his integrity and listening skills. He painted his walls grey, since he understood no policy could be black or white or red or blue. He was a Republican in a Democratic district. 
I also worked for the Conference of State Bank Supervisors in Washington DC. I worked in the Government section and assisted with lobbying both sides of the aisle at the US Capitol.  

At Civica AMC Colorado, my work involved supporting lobbying efforts for the Colorado Nurses Association and Foundation, Colorado Hospice Association, Colorado Physical Therapy Association, and the Colorado Campground Association, to name a few. I also coordinated Capitol Days for our Association’s members to walk the halls and meet their state Senators and Representatives. I took on this responsibility to get back to the Statehouse to organize our Association members to be active in lobbying for bills that were important to their industry. This job had me involved with both sides of the aisle.

Political Donations since November 10, 2015:
Arapahoe County Democrats - $19 Yard Sign, October 2020
Neighbor John Kellner, Candidate for 18th Judicial District Attorney (R), he placed a yard sign in our yard - $0 Yard Sign, October 2020

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have always been a volunteer and involved in community work. The only change was the community I was living in through the years. 
I grew up on a farm and learned the importance of community. I now work for an agriculture association and work every day to move the needle to promote beef and sustain the business of US Farmers and Ranchers. 
I volunteer for the Arts. I have been serving for nearly 6 years on the Greenwood Village Arts and Humanities Council. I advocate to enhance the Arts in Greenwood Village, to fund our high school scholarship program and to diversify our programming on the board. 
I have sat on the board at Young Voices of Colorado for 6 years. During the fight to defund Tier III of SCFD, I went to the Capitol to lobby in favor of setting aside more funds for Tier III. Tier III organizations are the non-profits reaching out to the community to participate in the arts at a low-cost entry level.
Recently, I have become more involved in Native American community groups. Now that Zoom allows easy access to conferences and webinars, I have taken the opportunity to join Native webinars for diversity education. I have joined the Native American Culture and Equity group through Denver Public Schools. Being Choctaw, I have chosen to become educated and to be an advocate for my Nation.
Working for a Colorado association management firm, I have worked with volunteer leaders from across the state in the health industry, including the Colorado Nurses Association. Part of this work included optimizing their voice by finding common interests across rural and metropolitan areas. I also worked with volunteer leaders of the Colorado Campground Association creating a map of camping regions based on geographic location and character. 
Recently I joined other community members in opposition to a resolution passed by Greenwood Village City Council which ran counter to state legislation to improve police oversite. My letter stressed the importance of not passing a resolution that divided our community, state, and nation.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to be a part of the commission because I believe this process will serve Colorado well by giving a voice to the citizens instead of the political parties. I feel I will be a good choice since I believe in fairness and creating a balanced legislative body that represents the diverse constituents of Colorado. I believe that a Member of the legislature at the state or national level should have to listen to the views of the entire district. If you have a district with a sense of balance of views, then the legislator will need to moderate their views and be consensus driven to keep their seat. I think this would be a step to moderate and calm the political climate in the state.

I feel it is essential for Colorado legislators to be responsive and represent their constituents. Political parties should not control the citizen legislator. While coalitions and caucuses are needed to move legislation, legislators must first listen to constituents. 
I have been exposed to a wide range of views based on my personal experiences. I have lived around the world and coexisted with people of all cultures. I have worked in both the statehouse here in Colorado and the US Capitol. I have spent most of my life working for constituents in association management and with volunteer leaders. I understand the need of serving the greater good from my 20+ years as an Active Duty Navy spouse and now a Veteran&#39;s spouse.  I feel I represent the views of women, military members, agriculture, rural citizens, and Native Americans.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am a good listener. I think listening is the most important part of communication. I do not believe in sidebar deals but think the committee should come to consensus. I can be fair and impartial, and I would approach this with an open mind to all views. I am interested in serving on this Commission for the best outcome possible. This only happens every 10 years, and it needs to be right. Colorado must be districted to keep communities together and to award legislators that will represent the varied views of the District. No District should be known as a Democrat or Republican District, but a District of a location of Colorado citizens that need fair and equal representation. I hope this is possible with the Commission that is chosen to complete this important job.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Every day I work to create consensus with the voices and needs of our state partners. AT NCBA I must balance the state interest from across the Nation to coordinate and implement programming and messaging to promote a unified national beef message. I balance beef marketing statistics; market trends, industry news and state need to develop agendas for Federation road maps for the organization. My educational background is in Economics, and I do not shy away from spreadsheets and data analysis. I am more comfortable making decisions that can be supported on data and analysis. 

I also run the webstore, BeefStore.org for the Beef. It’s What’s For Dinner. brand. Everything that I choose to have sold on the store I investigate the past purchases, demand trends over time, need by states for extension of promotional programs, availability from supplier, and cost of goods. With a limited budget, it is essential to use market data and history to create a plan to move forward. This Commission is not a webstore, but it needs to have data and analysis done to create the plan to move forward.
