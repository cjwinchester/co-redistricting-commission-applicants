        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Kristopher West</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Kristopher West
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Kris</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Computer Technician for Boulder Valley School District
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Associate of Applied Science in Computer Science from Front Range Community College
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80516
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I&#39;ve done volunteer work for Colorado Republicans from time to time. I&#39;ve worked our voter information booth at Erie events on a few occasions and helped hand out campaign literature. I also helped gather signatures for the national popular vote referendum.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am a precinct committee person for Weld County Republicans. I also served as a delegate to the Weld Republican Convention in 2020 and 2018. In 2012 I was a delegate to the Colorado Republican convention and I have also served as a delegate to Boulder County Republicans and Larimer County Republicans when I lived in those respective counties. I have also done some small scale volunteer work with a few campaigns for state house and school boards such as canvasing and helping with web design.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
The only political organization I&#39;ve been a part of since 2015 has been Weld County Republicans. I have been a precinct committee person since 2018.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The way Colorado has historically drawn its districts has been excessively partisan and politicized and this has historically led to districts that poorly represent the communities they contain. As an example, when I was a resident of Longmont I recall helping a candidate for Colorado State House. The seat I was in, State House District 11, was drawn in such a way that it encompassed much of Longmont but a tendril of the district ran down the diagonal highway into Boulder while the other half of the town of Longmont was divided into a district that, if memory serves, ran into Lafayette. Longmont spent the better part of a decade represented by an individual from Lafayette and an individual from Boulder even though the town of Longmont itself would&#39;ve been big enough to have one district dedicated entirely to the town, a seat that would&#39;ve been competitive and would&#39;ve guaranteed the election of a Longmont resident. Watching the 2010 redistricting cycle we saw a series of 5-4 party-line votes on the old commission that shifted boundaries in a way that was designed purely to cut a few Republican incumbents out of their seats, a decision even the generally left-leaning Denver Post described as &quot;vindictive&quot;. I was thrilled to see Amendment Z pass replacing the old panel of politicians with a bi-partisan citizen&#39;s panel and I would love the opportunity to help my state draw districts that represent communities rather than partisan interests.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I&#39;m a Republican who, in my professional career, works for Boulder County Schools. In the past I&#39;ve worked for Adams 12 Schools, Poudre Schools and Workforce Boulder County. Working with people I don&#39;t align with politically has been a fairly routine part of my life. While I aim to be one of the Republican members of the commission, I&#39;m not aiming to see districts drawn that favor my own party. I&#39;m aiming to work with the other members of the commission to draw districts that clearly and fairly represent common communities of interest and that give voters a fair chance to elect people who accurately represent them.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am a computer technician by trade and most of my job involves researching a problem, use of process of elimination and analytical thinking. For the process of redistricting, I actually believe computer software might be among the most fair and impartial way of drawing districts. Geographic information systems software (GIS) could be used to draw up districts that allow for the effective representation of communities of interest. Such software could easily propose districts that have similar income levels, similar occupations, that fairly represent different demographic groups and ensure fair representation.
