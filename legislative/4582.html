<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not made any donations to campaigns or other political organizations since 2015 except a $75 contribution on July 2, 2016 to &quot;End Gerrymandering Now&quot;, an issue committee whose registered purpose was &quot;To support citizen initiatives that seek to reform the redistricting process for congressional districts and state legislative districts&quot;.

I was an active member of the bipartisan coalition that worked to put Amendments Y &amp; Z on the 2018 general election ballot.

As an attorney with Ireland, Stapleton, Pryor and Pascoe, I have provided professional representation for one candidate committee (Co-counsel, Cary Kennedy for Governor, 2017-2018) and for various citizen initiatives, including:
Yes on Amendment B (Co-counsel, 2020)
Initiatives to reform the redistricting process (Fair Maps Colorado and Fair Districts Colorado, 2017-2018)
and various nonpartisan/bipartisan initiatives relating to issues such as funding for preschool education and expanded learning opportunities for students in kindergarten through twelfth grade.

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As an attorney I have helped organize, represent, and advocate for numerous groups and organizations in Colorado, some of which are identified in my answers to the previous questions.

As my attached professional history demonstrates, I have many years of service working for state and local government in which I was called upon to consider the interests of various groups, organizations, and associations. Some examples:
As Deputy Secretary of State for nearly 13 years, I conducted hundreds of public hearings at which interest groups presented and advocated for their positions. During this time I chaired the Initiative Title Setting Board for citizen initiatives and conducted rule-making hearings on behalf of the Secretary of State. 
As an administrative law judge and hearing officer for the City and County of Denver, I conducted numerous licensing and regulatory hearings on behalf of city agencies, requiring the taking of evidence under oath, considering the testimony of applicants, opponents, and neighborhood organizations, and issuing recommended decisions based on my consideration of competing interests and governing legal principles. 
As an attorney for the General Assembly&#39;s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Legal Services, I co-chaired many review and comment hearings concerning proposed citizen initiatives.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Almost all of my professional career has been devoted to serving our democracy in various capacities. In particular, I worked for many years as a nonpartisan attorney for the Colorado General Assembly. There, I worked directly with hundreds of legislators from various districts across Colorado and came to appreciate how they served the interests of their diverse districts. I also helped staff the first redistricting commission, the Colorado Reapportionment Commission in 1981, where I saw first-hand the importance of drawing district lines that meet constitutional and statutory requirements.

In recent years I have become concerned about the detrimental effects of noncompetitive congressional and state legislative districts. In particular, it seems that safe seats encourage candidates to appeal to the extremes of their political parties, which in turn results in increased legislative polarization. Safe seats and political polarization make compromise difficult and leads too often to legislative gridlock.

I have a background and perspective of political independence and nonpartisanship that would inform my service on the commission. As someone who participated in the bipartisan coalition that led to the adoption of Amendments Y &amp; Z, I am committed to supporting the implementation of the new redistricting process. My hope is that my service on a redistricting commission would contribute to successful implementation, resulting in more competitive districts and fairer representation for our citizens.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that my ability to be fair and impartial has been utilized and demonstrated throughout many years of government service, including 18 years serving in a nonpartisan capacity for the Colorado General Assembly and 13 years serving as Deputy Secretary of State for five different Republican and Democratic secretaries of state. For example, my 13 years of chairing the State&#39;s Initiative Title Setting Board required ensuring that the decisions of the Board were fair and impartial.

Likewise, I believe that my career demonstrates a commitment to promoting consensus and creating agreement among diverse interests. For example, during my tenure with the Colorado Secretary of State&#39;s Office, I facilitated advisory committees that we created to guide the Office in the areas of campaign finance, lobbyist regulation, and business registration. Particularly in the area of campaign finance, we found that bringing together opposing political interests could result in finding common ground and improvements in the laws and regulations governing campaign finance regulation.

Both as Deputy Secretary of State and Assistant Director of the Office of Legislative Legal Services, my management style was inclusive and team-oriented. I worked to empower teams and encourage decision-making through consensus to the maximum extent possible.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My undergraduate degree is in Mathematics, where my concentration was in the field of Abstract Algebra. My work focused on analyzing and proving theorems involving abstract systems. Successful proofs required rigorous attention to logic and reason. The discovery of an elegant solution was always very rewarding.
My training and experience as an attorney required developing critical thinking and developing solutions and conclusions based on facts and the law.
As an administrative law judge, I gained additional experience in digesting and analyzing lengthy and conflicting testimony and complex legal arguments, and then writing a decision that applied logic and reason to the facts and the law.
