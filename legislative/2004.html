        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Cathleen McGrath</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Cathleen McGrath
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Cathleen Hunter-Siegert</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Student Success Counselor at Colorado State University Global
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in Political Science with a minor in Anthropology and I am 500 hour certified yoga teacher
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80128
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not donated any money to a campaign or political organization. Even though I understand that campaigns require substantial funds just to stay afloat, much less be success, I reject the notion of money in politics and refuse to participate in that fashion. I have however volunteered with various campaigns over the years opting to donate my time instead of my money.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
During my attendance at MSU Denver (2016-2018) I was recipient of the Urban Leadership Scholarship and a member of the Urban Leadership Program and also sat on the committee for the university chapter of the American Democracy Project. Both organizations were fundamentally about meeting people where they are at, having engaged discourse with people of differing opinions, actively listening, being an advocate when necessary, and generally studying leadership in the areas of community, business and politics at a local, state and national level.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have less practical experience in these areas and more knowledge from time studying representation and advocacy during my time studying political science in school and post-graduation. As a Student Success Counselor at CSU Global I have had many discussions with leadership, and continue to press on these issues, about how we can better serve our minority populations as an academic institution. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on this commission because I believe the independent commission to be an pivotal step in the right direction to move away from partisan gerrymandering and towards honoring the principles of a fair electorate, which is why I voted in favor of this commission in the first place. Additionally, I am unaffiliated because I do not believe that we as a nation benefit from the strong two party system that has sprung up and fortified gross division in recent decades and for this reason I believe someone like myself, who is not aligned or beholden to a specific political party or agenda, to be the best fit for a commission such as this. I believe this is my chance to serve my community. I am always looking for ways to both use my passion and education in political science and to serve my community and I genuinely believe this commission to be that for me.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I find that the best way to build consensus or to create agreement among others is to very actively listen to and break apart each side of a debate as to understand where solutions can be made to draw the opposing sides together toward a middle ground. It is most important in situations such as with this commission to remove emotion and agenda from the equation and to allow reason and logic to be the guiding principles of decision making. When emotion and agenda is removed we are better suited to problem solve in a cogent that meets the reality of the problem at hand.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a Student Success Counselor (aka Academic Advisor) I am often having to apply logic and analytical skills to solve student problems where there is often a lot of emotion involved for students, I am able to help break through that reactionary space and explain in a way that makes sense to the student different options so that they feel empowered to choose the best solution for themselves. Additionally, as student of Political Science my entire education was built around having to discuss topics that evoked a lot of passion and opinions in a way that maintained and honored the academic space we were in, this included working successfully in groups with students who were diametrically in opposition to my own political beliefs where we had to reach some kind of consensus for the purpose of completion.
