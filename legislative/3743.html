        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Sean S Steele</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Sean S Steele
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I currently am the general manager of Old Steel LLC, a company that specializes in the curation, appraisal, and consignment of historical military artifacts and memorability. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I served in the United States Marine Corps, and furthered my education post-service with a bachelors equivalent in Airframe and Powerplant maintenance. I also am skilled in the trades of carpentry and appliance repair.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80241
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In 2007, I worked with some grassroots supporters for the Obama administration at my high school. In 2016 I had a brief internship with the trump campaign. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I was involved with the Englewood Masonic lodge #166 in 2015-2016. While I do not have much experience with working in volunteer groups, I would like to start by getting involved and giving back to the community that has given me so much. I hope to be considered for the honor of helping protect fairness in our elections, as it is my civic duty. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My experience stems from my military service, and from my previous occupations. I was able to use my skills and knowledge to help people in need, from repairing broken appliances to rebuilding structures in peoples homes. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
From when I was a young age, I knew that I wanted to serve my country and my state. My time in the military allowed me the privilege to help people from around the world, and I earned a presidential unit citation and a humanitarian service medal for my work in Japan during operation Tomodachi, the US/Japanese disaster relief after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. I was able to bring much needed food and medical supplies to the distraught people of the area, and this firmly cemented my understanding that giving is its own reward. I have had a strong dedication to this country and my community for as long as I can remember, and this would be an excellent opportunity for me to get involved. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
One of my strongest traits is my compelling charisma. I am able to carry on meaningful conversations and share ideas with people of any background regardless of race, religion, political leanings or gender identity. I enjoy challenging my belief system by exposing myself to new ideas. In an age where political divisiveness is the name of the game, the ability to engage with people regardless of physical traits is a rare quality that I am happy to bring to the table.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
During my military career, I was a crew chief on a medium-lift supply helicopter. I had to react quickly in a highly dynamic environment, and work directly alongside people from all over the world. I have the ability to recognize problems quickly, and resolve them; sometimes using unorthodox or untested methods. In spite of an early life ADHD diagnosis, I have overcome that obstacle and have become a valuable asset to the teams that I have had the privilege of working with over the years.
