        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Jennifer Adamson Clanahan</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Jennifer Adamson Clanahan
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently the Colorado State Director for a non-profit organization called Mountain Mamas. We amplify women’s voices into a movement to ensure our kids grow up in a healthy climate with clean air and access to public lands.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I am a graduate of South High School in Denver and of University of Colorado in Boulder. I have a B.A. in Anthropology. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80206
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have worked for and volunteered for several elected officials, candidates and campaigns. As you’ll see from my resume, I have worked for elected officials on Denver City Council as well as Members of Congress, both on campaigns and in official offices. I have not however worked for any of them in the last four years. 
Donations I’ve made since 2015 include Joe Biden’s Presidential campaign, John Hickenlooper, Hillary Clinton, Theresa Greenfield, Steve Bullock, Amy McGrath, Jaime Harrison, Cal Cunningham, Mark Kelly, Michael Bennet, Faith Winter, Paul Lopez, the Democratic National Committee.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I’m a member of the PTA at my daughter’s elementary school, I’ve volunteered there as a Class mom, a Character education program volunteer, on fundraising events, field day and many other events.
I’ve also volunteered as a poll watcher for the Democratic party, with Impact Locally to feed those experiencing homelessness in Denver, and with Moms Demand Action.
I’m a member of organizations such as Conservation Colorado and the Wild Animal Sanctuary, and Girl Scouts of Colorado where I’ve been a member, volunteer and mom of a Girl Scout. I also partnered with them to create a new Girl Scout patch in Colorado, which I’m told is one of their most popular.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Organizing, representing and advocating describes the majority of my nearly 30 year career, the last 20 of which have been here at home in Colorado. I have advocated for conservation issues as well as a number of other issues with non-profit organizations doing everything from writing letters to the editor to organizing events to writing action alerts to organize others to advocate for issues. I’ve served on Boards of Directors and represented those organization in the community, as well as the various elected officials for whom I have worked. I have also represented the interests of groups when briefing elected officials. It’s a two-way street! I’ve also represented the interests of my neighborhood and small businesses in our neighborhood to City Council during meetings and decision-making processes.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am passionate about government that works to make the world better for those it serves and that means serving all its constituents equally. I strongly believe that everyone deserves equal representation. Gerrymandering has diminished or unduly strengthened the representation of some groups to the detriment of others. It must stop. I would love to be a part of the solution delivering Colorado a fair map that gives everyone the same opportunities and I believe I have the experience and the skills to do so.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Because I am passionate about equal rights and equal representation in our government, I will work hard to find the plan that is truly beneficial for everyone. I will be impartial as I listen to all members of the public and their feedback about proposed maps. I believe in our government and our Democratic systems. For them to work properly though each person must receive the same rights, representation and ability to shape their government. It’s the reason that I have personally been so active in campaigns and in government, because I believe in our system and want to do everything I can to ensure that it’s the best it can be. 
I’ve also grown up in a tightknit family with widely different political views. It is a continual lesson in really listening to others and understanding other perspectives. My family has offered lessons I carry with me in all facets of my life and work. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I worked for several years for a private foundation where my primary responsibility was to review, analyze and recommend grant applications for funding. I had to determine which ones would best meet the goals of the foundation. It required analytical skills, asking the right questions and listening carefully to the answers of those seeking funds along with a full understanding of the foundation’s goals. Similarly, I was appointed by Governor Ritter to serve on the Colorado’s Wildlife Habitat Stamp Committee, the committee tasked with reviewing and selecting proposals for funding from the state to protect wildlife habitat. Analytical skills have also been critical to my work in reviewing proposed legislation for elected officials within the context of what is best for constituents.
