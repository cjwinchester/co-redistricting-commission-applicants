        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Diane M Waddoups</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Diane M Waddoups
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Diane Waddoups, Diane Marie Waddoups</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am the owner of Milne &amp; Associates, a $12,000,000 Colorado Small Business for the last 8 years, taking over a company I have worked at for 31 years.  We are manufacturer representatives in the Office Products Industry, selling products to dealers and wholesalers in the Rocky Mountain region (6 states).  Our customers are in the Commercial Channel of business (i.e. Staples, Office Depot/Max, independent dealers, regional and national wholesalers).  We also work on the collegiate level (Colleges/Universities).
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I am a high school graduate with some college.  My first job found me working for a division of the Denver Board for the Development Disabled at a sheltered workshop.  The last 31 years I have been working at and became owner of Milne &amp; Associates as a manufacturer representative.  Focus on B2B, marketing solutions, manufacturer sales to consumers (Fortune 500 to small, locally owned businesses).  We manage relationships with large US based manufacturers (i.e. Pilot Pen, Gojo/Purell, Fellowes, Deflecto...and many others), along with dealers and consumers (end users).  It is a fast paced, constantly changing environment where relationships are key...and creating consumer pull through keep us (along with our manufacturers and dealers) competitive.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80118
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have never been formally involved in the political process, beyond being a diligent voter of every election since I turned of age.  I am however, READY to move into more involvement in my community and my country.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I was a volunteer/instructor for Westernaires, a non-profit organization in Jefferson  County who teach our youth how to ride horses and perform for events such as the National Western Stock Show, etc. (ages 9 to 19).   From 1998 to 2006, I was blessed to teach our young adults responsibility and team building through horseback riding.    

I belong to the Rocky Mountain Skyline Bookstore Association for Colorado...a group of Universities and Colleges.  We brainstorm on ways to provide products and services for collegiate departments and students.

I was an advocate to the Denver School Board during my daughter&#39;s education within Denver Public Schools.  We worked with the school board to push for and keep, the Arts in our school. 

Rocky Mountain Travelers Club.  Secretary for this Colorado based Office Products Channel Group, cementing relationships and coordinating events for all (Manufacturers, Dealers and Distributors in a 6 state area). 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have not been a part of many associations, but enough to make me very well rounded in critical aspects of our life here in Colorado.   Being a business owner and staying successful takes all of the skills and more to stay afloat.   I have spent lots of time with our youth in Colorado, giving them a place to achieve confidence and share in the benefits of team-building for themselves outside of schools (and labeling) that comes with it.  Watching these young adults grow and find success outside the &quot;norm&quot; was a beautiful thing to see.  I still keep in touch with my students, who are now grown with careers and families of their own.   Advocating for the Arts within education was a huge push for me when schools cried budget cuts and decided these programs could (and would) be cut.   This essential segment of education by our schools had to know and understand, the importance of the arts (music - orchestral, band and choral).
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am the product of the American Dream!  I&#39;m 56 years old...a woman who came from VERY humble beginnings.   I was a teen pregnancy at 16 years old, married at 16 to a wonderful man who is still my husband celebrating 40 years of marriage in June 2021.  I finished high school with the support of my loving family, who watched my infant daughter, then was sent to college by a supportive employer.  I dedicated my working career to a wonderful company, Milne &amp; Associates, working my way from a receptionist to a sales representative.  I became a partner after 20 years, then an owner 8 years ago.  I am damn proud!  I worked hard, paid my dues and HERE I AM!    I want to pay it forward so others can follow in my footsteps and achieve anything they put their mind to.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I think we can all say this country is divided, DEEPLY divided and it&#39;s time to rein this in.  Colorado has grown exponentially since the last census and this state needs to come together more than ever.  The residents in our state need to know without doubt, that their votes are distributed in our elections fairly.    I am an owner, an advocate...and I am assertive.  Finding balance between your goals...but also understanding the needs and limitations of those you are trying to reach out to.  Be it sales or relationships, especially now we need to find a balancing factor between success and understanding.  To convince others of need for a particular idea, product or change without steamrolling them over is KEY in what I do every single day as a business owner.  It&#39;s a delicate balance...my customer&#39;s love me and support me to levels that surprise me all the time.  How wonderful it is to see things come together when everyone feels like a winner (or at least part of the solution).  It&#39;s a rush and it makes me proud when we can achieve it.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Per above...I have been doing this every day for the last 20+ years.  I have to be honest, I didn&#39;t even know of this commission until a few days ago.  I live in Larkspur and one of my neighbors (who is an attorney), told me about it.  I have been wanting so to get involved in my community, in town council...in the political wave that is Colorado.   I have taken my knocks, but I grown, I learn, I LISTEN!  There is no one size fits all approach to ANYTHING in life...and I AM READY!  

Please note that I did not have time to acquire Letters of Recommendations, but would be honored to do so if need be.
