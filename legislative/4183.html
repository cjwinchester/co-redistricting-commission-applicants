<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
In previous years, I worked as a Tribal Consultant for Native American tribes, councils, and organizations. I organized and executed meetings in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. I have had to work with numerous people at the federal and state management offices such as the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, and the U.S. Forest Service to execute federal mandates for American Indian Tribal Consultation. I have held numerous meetings involving these agencies as well as American Indian tribes to assist them with land management, archaeological site identification, and ethnographic research. My expertise in working with diverse people and ability to facilitate meetings through heated discussions and often sensitive topics has assisted greatly in the executing project work and making recommendations to federal agencies, independent contractors, and inner working staff for successful project outcomes.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have a great passion for the political process and how it serves the people in each state. Redistricting and advocating for the people each district serves has always been a passion of mine. Growing up in Arizona, there has always been very little representation for American Indians. Because of this, there have been many American Indians did not wish to vote. In the wake of the recent 2020 election, many American Indians decided to become part of this process. I believe redistricting would help to include many American Indians and other people who are under-served and feel as though they are not represented in local and state government.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My ability to be fair and impartial is clear. I have had many instances in my previous work as a Tribal Consultant where American Indian tribes and councils thought I was their representation, and other instances where an industry or company thought I was their representation. Both were correct and both were wrong. My approach is to clarify my position and let each person know that I am a third-party constituent and I am hired to provide comment and concern for each person and party involved. I am very willing to listen to all parties and persons involved and I have heard very strong opinions regarding sensitive topics. I am able to work through each topic within a group and assist groups with identifying the major points of discussion and see if there is agreement with each one. I think if we can find consensus among the group, we can move forward. For more difficult situations, I leave room for people who are unwilling or unable to speak publicly. I try to work with them and encourage them to provide their opinion to build a better group opinion for the record.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have taken several mediation and facilitation trainings with the National Civic League and with the Sierra Club.  As a Tribal Consultant, the field work includes compiling historic and ethnographic information and data for reporting and report summaries, meeting presentations, and the recording and collecting of meeting information for distribution afterward. I have expertise with logging and recording communications, both written and oral, and records management. My researching skills also include legal and medical documentation and background research for loss mitigation for a small business law firm. I have utilized both Excel and Access databases in all areas of my past careers for researching, analyzing, and compiling data.
