<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
$60 to Take Back Colorado since April, 2020 in $10 increments
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Mission Viejo HOA for about 5 months on a temporary fill-in basis since August.  Elections are early next year.  
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Mostly my experience in this area was many years ago when I had young children.  I was a coach of Olympics of the Mind, Destination imagination, a judge for the same organization; a Girl Scout Troop Leader for many years.  Then as my children grew up I applied these skills first as a teacher, then as a coach (manager) for the VA.  I had to organize the workflow for our team and ensure there was quality work flowing from the team.  Also I had to handle work-related personnel problems.  Since I was a middle manager, I saw my role as a bumper between the employees and upper management.  
Owning my own business during the pandemic has been a trial for sure.  Being a restaurant business, being closed for three months then having severely restricted seating capacity along with rising prices has tested my ability to keep the business afloat.  
I currently home school my grandson.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe in the principles that I am trying to teach my grandson: Teddy Roosevelt said it best&quot; It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena.&quot;  I want to be that man in the arena who is heavily involved in a situation that requires courage, skill, or tenacity (as opposed to someone sitting on the sidelines and watching).  In the process I will hopefully helping the republic I love and setting a good example for my grandson: two birds, one stone.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
At the VA I was a team leader for our lean six sigma program.  The most important thing I can do is really listen to each person, and then paraphrase what they said to be sure I got it, then help them frame the issue(s).  That just means looking at the issues from multiple perspectives—positive, negative or neutral—and then encourage them to develop unique solutions for each frame.  If you really attempt to do this, then the issue of being fair and impartial takes care of itself because you are looking at it from all angles, positive, negative, and neutral.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have two degrees in science.  I always use the scientific method to solve problems.  Specifically, it is the technique used in the construction and testing of a scientific hypothesis. But I have found it very useful in solving problems at home, at the restaurant, and in life in general.  You observe, ask questions, and seek answers through &#39;tests and experiments&#39;.  These tests and experiments are not experiments in the usual sense but in the general sense.  For instance you find you are running out of Tito&#39;s vodka within days of getting a fresh case.  So you begin to ask questions: did we have any large parties or special requests?  Did we have more sales than usual (of food and liquor)? Are we running a Tito&#39;s special? Who logged in the liquor?  Was the liquor properly locked in the liquor closet?  Are there any new employees?  Then you begin to look at the evidence: sales receipts from the liquor company; sales receipts from guests; point of sales records; employee clock-in and clock-out times.  Then you begin to form hypotheses and finally you test your hypotheses and then you will be able to develop broad general explanation.  I do not know the procedure of drawing up congressional districts but I know there will be data that will help us form a hypothesis.  I get happy just thinking about this endeavor!
