<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am also an acting member of Claims Support for Veterans, helping Wartime Veterans seek Federal and VA funding to help pay for their ongoing care.  Additionally, I am the Owner of Resolute Planning and Notary Services.  I operate daily as a closing agent, specializing in Reverse Mortgage loans for Seniors over the age of 62.  
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have an undergraduate degree in Accounting from the BYU Marriot School of Business.  I worked for 10 years at KPMG in their International Executive Service Department as a tax Associate and Senior Tax Associate.  In 2012, I started working with the American Association of Wartime Veterans / Claims Support for Veterans as an agent helping Wartime veterans obtain Federal aid to cover senior care costs.  This position led me to be nominated as the North Metro Woman of the Year from the Chamber of Congress.  In January 2020, I obtained training to become a Signing Agent; thereby assisting Seniors in closing of their home loans and reverse Mortgage loans from their homes.

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am passionate about programs that strengthen families and allow disadvantaged citizens to find success using community resources.  I have worked actively with the Boyscouts, local food banks, and served on the Public Affairs committee of my church to unite different faiths to achieve our common goals.  I have donated time to smaller local campaigns, such as Paula Dickerson, in her quest for State Senate.  I have also spent time assisting Emma Pinter in her campaigns for Westminster City Council and County Commissioner.  These two women were close friends, and my intent was to support them in their desires to serve Colorado.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am the Vice President of the PTA at Hulstrom K-8, and I have served actively on numerous community outreach programs at the school such as The Sock and Underwear Drive, Book Drives, and Fundraisers for Habitat for Humanity and Joyful Journeys.  I have served for the past 5 years as a leader in the Relief Society Womensâ€™ Organization at my church, where I have worked heavily with older members of our congregation who needed assistance, particularly during the Covid 19 crisis.  
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have always had a passion for Senior Citizens.  I have volunteered with Meals on Wheels, as well as teaching piano and organ classes for seniors at various rec centers.  I love Pilates, and I have taught pro-bono classes for Seniors to help them gain and keep mobility and strength.  I am a part of numerous Senior Networking groups on Facebook and Linked in, all designed to help seniors find access to community resources for the social and physical needs.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I love Colorado, and I want to serve my state in a way that doesn&#39;t increase the Political divide that is so prevalent now.  I believe that we are all more alike than different, and that a fair voting system combined with boundaries that make sense gives Colorado the best chance at electing leadership that best represents our local needs.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As stated above, I am affiliated with the Republican party but have actively served to help friends of all parties find success in Government.  I have good friends from both the Republican party and the Democratic party, and I have enjoyed learning and celebrating the differences between the two parties. Both parties have strengths and weaknesses, the United States and Colorado benefits from having both parties working both oppositionally and cooperatively.  I believe that good, fair leaders can come from all parties, and that having a cool, calm mindset can always yield a better outcome than joining hysteria and panic.  As a Colorado native, I have loved seeing my state grow and contribute to the nation in so many significant ways.  With that, I want to be a part of strategies to encourage growth and structure that makes sense for the Colorado electorate.  Different communities have different needs, and as a Denver native, I feel I am in a unique position to evaluate the needs and demographics of different communities.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
With my educational background and years working in Public Accounting, I have a strong skill set with numbers and sets of data.  I am good with deadlines, and I have learned how to multi task effectively (being a mom of 3 helps there too!).  I am a good public speaker, and I tend to end up in leadership positions because of my level-headedness and ability to see problems from all sides.  I believe in building coalitions, and in working cooperatively wherever possible.  I also have learned that laughter and light-heartedness can be a valuable skill when facing tension and difficult decisions.
