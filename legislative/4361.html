<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In 2019 I gave $25 to Michael Bennet (Dem, Candidate for US Senate)

From 1995-2006 I volunteered and worked for a number of candidates on the local level (Non-partisan campaigns) and state and federal levels (Democrat party and campaigns) and I was a Democratic candidate for the Colorado State House in 1996.  

In 2012 and 2013 I volunteered and worked for several Republican candidates for the Colorado State House.

I believe strongly in our country’s democracy and electoral process and have struggled as both major parties have become more entrenched in extreme viewpoints facilitated by “safe seats” at the expense of finding common ground and solutions to shared problems.  Since 2014, my professional and volunteer work has centered on nurturing non-profit, private, public partnerships that leverage resources in an effort to build and inclusive and collaborative community.

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Throughout my career I have maintained strong relationships in and have passionately worked to strengthen our diverse communities.  Most recently, I’m proudest of the work I’ve led at Swallow Hill, creating and expanding our Little Swallows Outreach program.  Little Swallows is a general music program that introduces three- and four-year-olds to the world of music making. In the last three years, prior to COVID, we grew this program from 1 school serving 65 pre-school children to working with 2,000 kids across 29 schools.  We bring this program to those schools that have Free &amp; Reduced Lunch rates of 90% or higher.  Little Swallows is a shining example of our work in diverse communities in early childhood setting.  

At Mile High United Way I helped leverage relationships and invest resources in our underserved communities driving social change and achieving measurable results in school readiness, youth success, and adult self-sufficiency across the metro area.  

As Executive Director of Stand for Children Colorado, we worked collaboratively to get The Read Act passed, ensuring key interventions for K-3 students who struggle to read.  These efforts have had direct positive impact on our underserved and diverse communities across our state.

As a volunteer with the American Red Cross Mile High Chapter I managed the Lowry shelter for more than 1,200 Katrina evacuees working to ensure the safety, well-being and stability for a diverse population in crisis. 

And as a board member and subsequently Executive Director of the Aurora Public Schools Foundation we developed and funded High School College and Career Centers for a school district serving 40,000 students of which 84% are from diverse backgrounds.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the Redistricting Commission so that I can roll up my sleeves and work with others to find common ground and understanding in an effort to improve our electoral process and strengthen our democracy.  I want to bring my perspectives, thoughts and ideas on how we can continue to advance the critical work of building a healthy and vibrant community for everyone.

I&#39;m applying for this Commission because I truly believe fairly drawn maps are an important part of the solution necessary to lessen the political divide that is tearing at the heart of our democracy.  Our democracy is strengthened when our elections are competitive.  Fair maps support the enfranchisement of voters and make politicians more responsive to their constituents.
Over the years I have been fortunate to have worked with dynamic teams, developed innovative programs and fostered inclusive cultures; established strategic plans through collaborative processes harnessing shared vision; tapped into the leadership of those around me navigating cross-sector partnerships and resolving complex issues; and mentored others to work constructively and beneficially to make our community stronger. 
 
I have spent my career at the intersection of social innovation and civic engagement.  As the CEO of Swallow Hill, I am committed to our strategic vision that our organization will be as well-known for the impact we make in our under resourced communities as we are for serving as the country’s second largest acoustic music school or the more than 250 concerts we produce annually featuring local musicians and national acts.  

My passion for building community and desire to affect change through the creation of social capital that can be leveraged to find solutions to the pressing problems of our day is seen in my volunteer activities and professional life.  I believe we have an obligation to give back and I see service on the Redistricting Commission as a way to uniquely enhance community impact.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe in the power of servant leadership and the values of active listening, mentorship, community mindedness, and the importance of building trust and reciprocity in civic engagement.

My passion for our community is matched by 20 years of serving in organizations and building successful teams around operations, communications, marketing, fundraising and partnership development.  

Examples of my collaborative efforts include working with Mile High United Way’s policy team successfully advocating for the continuation of the Child Care Contribution Income Tax Credit benefiting working families across our state; working with Stand for Children’s staff and members to successfully advocate for the passage of The Read Act; and working with Aurora Public Schools Foundation’s Board of Directors to embrace the district’s College and Career Center initiative.

As CEO of Swallow Hill I led an effort to bring all of our stakeholders to the table to create a new strategic vision guiding our work toward community impact for under resourced populations. And for nearly a decade I have mentored Colorado College Fellows serving in non-profit organizations across the region.  I am grateful to have the opportunity to mentor these future leaders and am proud to play a role in their professional development but the truth is that I gained as much from listening to and learning from these young leaders as gave in return.  It is in these one-on-one interactions and group settings where leadership takes shape and is developed for both the mentor and the mentee. 

My desire is to bring my experiences, passion and energy and knowledge to the work of the Redistricting Commission and thoughtfully and intentionally listen to the other commissioners around the table as we seek to improve our democracy together.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
For the last five years, serving as the CEO of Swallow Hill Music, I have led the budgeting for a $6,000,000 top line revenue organization.  In so doing I have ensured the execution of a music school that employs 60 teachers hosting 70,000 visits annually, a concert team that produces 250+ concerts each year bringing together 67,000 concert goers, and a community outreach department that works with more than 100 schools and organizations making 75,000 annual connections in our under-served communities through Little Swallows early childhood education, music therapy and K-12 enrichment programs.



As CEO I have had the opportunity to guide our organization in the stewardship and development of partnerships with other creative organizations such as Arvada Center for the Arts and Humanities, Clyfford Still Museum, Museum of Contemporary Art and Denver Center for the Performing Arts.  In addition, I have been an active member of the Scientific Cultural Collaborative, working with other SCFD Tier I and II organizations to ensure a healthy and vibrant community.

Over my professional career I have engaged critical thinking and analytical skills in the management of dynamic fundraising, public relations and operations.  I have directed complex operations, managed large multifaceted budgets, and worked on successful outcomes based programs building consensus across the private, public, non-profit and philanthropic sectors.

I have led efforts to expand and improve programs related to early childhood education; school readiness, youth success and adult self-sufficiency.  And I have been responsible for contract negotiations related to construction, production, transportation and risk management in addition to general operations, management of a 13,000 volunteer supported event and management and procurement for a national party convention’s $55 million budget that concluded with a clean audit.
