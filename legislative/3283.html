<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
In my professional role, I represent and advocate on behalf of more than 70 nonprofits annually to my board of trustees to be considered for funding. These are nonprofits from across the state, representing rural communities and communities along the Front Range. Similarly, I perform similar duties when considering grant applications for the City of Wheat Ridge from local nonprofits, while balancing the limited funding we have to distribute. Currently, I am on the Jefferson County Fairgrounds Advisory Committee and the Youth, Equine, and Ag Working Group for the Fairgrounds as we consider various uses and interests of the Jefferson County Fairgrounds. The role requires members to represent, involve, and engage various stakeholders and we restructure the future of the Fairgrounds. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I enjoy being involved in civic activities and processes. This particular process will have long-lasting effects for the next several decades and it is important it is done in a fair and impartial way. At the municipal and county level, I have been an active and engaged citizen and have worked on matters with a balanced approach and long-term vision, which I would also bring to the commission. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my personal and extracurricular roles there are often competing interests and differing views on approaches, actions, or solutions. In my opinion, consensus begins with listening, clear communication, rooting one another in the same goal, and ensuring we stay aligned within this throughout the process. There is value in what each commissioner brings, and it is important to recognize that in each other throughout the process. Likewise, it is important to remain fair and impartial. Not only because that is what Coloradans expect from this process but because Coloradans also expect the commissioners to come to the table with integrity. 

In my community engagement work, I have had to set aside personal opinions and believes in order to remain impartial. For example, the restructuring of the Fairgrounds holds a personal draw since I spent my childhood at the Fairgrounds riding horses. While there is an emotional pull, I have learned to separate this from the facts around usage, value, community use and understanding what a viable future looks like. Bringing emotions into my role on the advisory committee or working group does not benefit me as a member nor does it benefits the future of the Fairgrounds, so it is critical for me to remain fair and impartial. This also ensures I remain a good team member for the others on the committee. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Throughout a grant review process, I must analyze the strength of each nonprofit based on community need, number of residents served, outcomes, financials, etc. Similarly, through my work at the Fairgrounds, when understanding the frequency and usage of the property, our committee pulled numbers around building usage, rental rates, days of the week, and hours of use to understand the full picture of the Fairground&#39;s usage. Numbers can be valuable in understanding a story further. There is also value in not stopping at numbers alone but understanding the “why” behind the numbers.
