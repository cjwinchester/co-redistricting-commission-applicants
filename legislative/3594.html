<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not contributed to either party or any candidates in recent years. Prior to that my contributions were minimal.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Adams County Economic Development, Chair of OEDIT Advanced Industries Electronics Committee Chair of Grant Review Program, Denver Area Business Economists (DABE), National Association of Business Economists (NABE), Colorado Photonics Industry Association Board of Directors (CPIA), United States Professional Tennis Association (USPTA), including serving on National Platform Tennis Committee, Professional Platform Tennis Registry.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
In my work at the University of Colorado I put together their annual economic forecast. The project involved getting feedback from at least 100 people from the Colorado business community and organizing an event for 800 attendees. Over the years, I have been regularly quoted in the media regarding the state economy. I helped form the CPIA over 20 years ago. CPIA is a trade association that has benefitted high technology in Colorado. My volunteer work with OEDIT has significantly benefitted the Colorado economy in many ways.  I have been a leader in the USPTA at the local, regional, and national level and founded the teaching organization for platform tennis professionals. I have been active in DABE and NABE as a form of networking and continuing education.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My grandparents homesteaded in SW Colorado in 1913 and I grew up in NM about 40 miles away. I went to college in Colorado beginning in 1969 and have lived in Durango, Boulder, and Broomfield. Colorado is near and dear to my heart. I understand the importance of having a fair representative political system. My parents were educators and they instilled in me the importance of giving back to your community. Over the years I have worked with staff in the State Demography Office, Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, and the Colorado Legislative Council. I have worked with Census data and understand the role it plays in the districting process.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have been fortunate to serve as a leader and participant in numerous groups with diverse opinions across large geographic areas. The most important skill in building consensus is listening. Over the years I have conducted a significant amount of business and economic research that requires collecting, analyzing, and presenting the data in a fair and impartial manner. Much of that work was completed while working at the University of Colorado, i.e., it was essential to produce reports that were precise, fair, and impartial. A list of those reports is included as an attachment.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I received my bachelor&#39;s degree in mathematics from Ft. Lewis College, Ed.M. from Oregon State with an emphasis in education and athletic administration and MBA from the University of Colorado at Boulder. In addition, I have coached tennis professionally. It is essential to apply logic, reason, and analytical skills to be successful in all areas. I have attached a sample of my pre-pandemic 2020 economic forecast for Colorado.
