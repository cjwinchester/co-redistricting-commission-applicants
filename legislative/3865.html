<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
No money has ever been donated to a campaign or political organization
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Sigma Iota Rho, Candidate for Denver Charter School Board of Directors, served in elected office in Brazil and was appointed to leadership board for council.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I previously won a public office position on São Paulo’s Participatory Municipal Council to engage and negotiate in policy solutions on issues on a variety of issues relevant to my constituents. As the representative for the immigrant and refugee population, it was upon me to advocate and represent their needs to a whole council and government heads. I brought that experience back to Colorado in my current work working with a nonprofit on the Western Slope. As part of the Senior Leadership Team for the nonprofit, I work with local medical clinics to provide programming related to overall wellness, food security, education, and outreach programs to address the social determinants of health. I regularly collaborate with the local family resource centers and our local youth mentoring organizations to provide services to mutual clients and ensure that our programs are aligned. Our NGO also leads our local immigrant advocacy efforts, including facilitating opportunities for our immigrant community to access services and to engage the broader immigrant community.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe my combination of work experience working in a public office position and various advocacy and analytic roles with my advanced degree in Political Science and Economics is perfectly matched with the requisites of the commission. Moreover, I&#39;ve seen the importance of equitable representation from my experience, and want to ensure that the future of Colorado is set up to represent the diversity of our state and communities.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have refined my community engagement techniques to focus on coalescing community needs to create a shared strategic vision that will define impact initiatives. I believe community engagement requires the building of consensus with all stakeholders to establish this shared strategic vision. Such an approach empowers both the community and the project initiative team to reach it. This approach requires mutually respecting the insights of all stakeholders to create a unified goal. I have also seen the benefits of ensuring that community stakeholders have an active role within the project initiative as it increases commitment to the project goal. My position as a development projects manager in Brazil demonstrates my ability to build community engagement on needed development projects. After hearing from many immigrants and refugees who felt their integration needs were not being adequately met, I interfaced with local community leaders to explain the needs of the marginalized population. Together, we planned strategic interventions to meet the expressed needs of immigrants and refugees on the periphery of São Paulo. The engagement of community members to institute these interventions throughout the borough was robust as individuals with specialized experiences ensured the positive implementation of the initiatives.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
All of my work as a project director incorporates a strong emphasis on data as a part of monitoring and evaluation. This enables me and my team to continually learn and improve. Moreover, my use of data in programs empowers me to identify needs and remain responsive to community needs. As a consultant with the UN, I conducted extensive data analysis on environmental issues to assess and evaluate global sustainable economic development initiatives, create reports on environmental policies, and best government practices related to sustainability.
