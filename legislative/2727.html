<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As Associate VP at Metropolitan State University of Denver, I advocated for extending higher education to the suburbs  of Denver where non-traditional students live and work. In my position I was in charge of administering and expanding all Metro State off-campus programs, extending the affordable education opportunities of Metro State throughout the Denver metro area including into communities of color and those with widely varying income and education levels.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have strong interest in making sure districts are fairly apportioned so that every person&#39;s vote, regardless of where they live, has equal value.  Government diversity should mirror citizen diversity:  proper apportionment means that opportunities to vote and to serve are distributed equitably throughout the community.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My experience in higher education administration and as leader and member of non-profit Board committees has taught me to understand not just the facts and issues, but the individual perspectives of other stakeholders. I advocate for process and solutions that include broad buy-in, in which everyone’s voice is heard and considered with respect. Agreements emerging from this process represent people as well as ideas, and gain their power from shared commitment. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I believe I have strong analytical and problem-solving skills.  As an example, as chair of the Strategic Planning Committee for the Museum of Danish America, I recently led the committee through an analysis of issues contributing to declining Museum membership, a long-term problem that the Museum Board has been grappling with for several years. We identified one root of that problem as the decreasing interest of Danish-Americans in their immigrant ancestors.  Detailed analysis of this intractable demographic shift—loss of the aging first and second generations of Danish immigrants—suggested that we should broaden the focus of the Museum to the United States as a nation of immigrants, past and present, and identify factors that have broader relevance to Americans of all ethnic backgrounds.  I’m proud of my leadership during our analysis of this existential problem for the Museum:  I was able to break a problem into relevant contributing factors and to broaden the solution to reach beyond the immediate short-term difficulties of membership and revenue. In addition, I was able to lead the Committee toward a fuller understanding of the problem and the required approach, and in turn gain the full agreement of the Museum Board to change our focus as a result of this work.
