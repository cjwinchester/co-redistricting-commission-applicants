While stationed there I was registered as and voted as a Democrat in the 2012 US Presidential election. I have spoken to the Hawaii Office of Voter Registration and while they do not have an online system like we do in Colorado I was told they would verify my voter registration status via phone if I am potentially selected as a Committee member. I am happy to provide that information if necessary.

</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81301
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My past political activity consists of attending approximately a half dozen marches since November 10, 2015; to include the Woman&#39;s March (Jan 2017 and 2018), a Planned Parenthood march (Mar 2017), and a DACA march (Mar 2017). I supported the campaigns of two local Douglas County candidates (one for Congress and one for State Legislature) in 2018 (neither were elected) by canvassing and writing postcards.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
ACLU, non-profit

Castle Rock Pride, non-profit

RezDawg Rescue, non-profit

Casa De Paz, non-profit

Colorado Association of Notary Public, professional 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I was asked by a friend to help establish the Castle Rock Pride Organization, a non-profit focused on supporting and empowering the LGBTQ community in Castle Rock and the surrounding communities in Douglas County. In this capacity I served as the Executive Director; I ensured all necessary paperwork was filed with the Secretary of States office to secure non-profit status, lobbied local businesses for donations to sustain the organization and was instrumental in the coordination and execution of the first Pride festival in Douglas County.

As a member of RezDawg Rescue, in addition to fostering 2 puppies, I organized and led numerous adoption events throughout the Front Range. I worked closely with pet store managers and foster volunteers to conduct successful adoption events, placing deserving animals in their forever homes. Throughout 2018-2019 I also attended several Colorado Legislative sessions of the Pet Animal Care Facilities Act (PACFA) Committee to support Animal rights throughout Colorado and ensure our rescue was aware of and compliant with all emerging legislative requirements. 

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Since the time I was a child Iâ€™ve gravitated towards community engagement and service. I grew up involved in 4H, focused on helping others. Whether it was walking 30 miles in a fund raiser for the food bank, cleaning an elderly neighbors garage or mucking stalls in preparation for the county fair; this foundation propelled me to develop into a confident, young adult.  With excess credits, I graduated from high school a semester early and after a semester of college joined the United States Air Force; destined for a 35 year career in the United States Intelligence Community (20 years in the USAF, 15 years with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency [NGA]). I have always focused my energies on doing my best; applying the analytical skills I was taught as a young airman, standing up for the underdog and ensuring fair application of sparse community resources by skillful negotiation with multiple customers to answer the toughest analytical questions. I retired from NGA in April 2016, I enjoy our retirement and traveling the country with my husband (and our two dogs) in our RV and was involved in several non-profits on the Front Range; however we recently moved to Durango and Iâ€™m seeking new opportunities to continue contributing - not only to the great state of Colorado but to my new community of Durango. Selection to one of the Redistricting Commissions would allow me to help shape the voice and vision of Colorado for the next 10 years, I can not imagine a more distinguished honor. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My professional experience of over 35 years in the USAF and then with NGA has provided me with a firm foundation in  analysis and leadership. I have had the benefit of attending some of the best military and civilian leadership classes available in the country throughout my career. These classes have provided me a foundation in diplomacy and conflict resolution which I have continued to successfully apply to volunteer positions Iâ€™ve held since retiring.  I have years of experience assisting people in recognizing how implementing solutions which address others needs can also satisfy their needs. If selected I have confidence in my ability to utilize these skills to assist our team in arriving at bipartisan solutions which will reflect the values of our wonderful state and benefit all Coloradans
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
While working for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency my primary job was to prioritize intelligence important to Commanders across the Pacific Theater (to cite a few examples: possible missile launches in Korea, typhoon damage/humanitarian relief in SEAsia or troop movements in Russia) all of which can occur simultaneously. It was a delicate daily balancing act to satisfy the highest priority needs while still keeping an eye on lower priority requirements. I was frequently called upon to brief the leaders across the Command on the best way to satisfy competing needs with limited resources. My ability to present this information in a clear, easily digestible manner resulted in my (additional duty) selection as the Executive Officer for the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) liaison office at Pacific Command, responsible for coordination of all DNI visits, briefing senior visitors from D.C. and the answering/staffing of any DNI questions; a highly visible position.Â
