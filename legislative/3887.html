<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
From my youth to the present, I have been representing groups and organizing people for the best interests of all.  My experience began and continues with GIRL SCOUTS and advocating for girls and leadership opportunities for women. As a mother of two boys, this passion grew to include school groups (years of leading Parent Information Committee) and encouraging parents to be involved with their school age youth, continued with the community and my representation of the manufacturing sector on the Steamboat Springs Chamber Board due to my role in the value-added agricultural/cultural tourism enterprise, Routt County Woolens.  I&#39;ve represented the Beef industry as a Routt County CattleWoman, acting in various roles.  My community work has included serving with the Routt County United Way and Women United to advocate for education, youth and child services, financial stability and crisis services in our local area. I also serve actively with the local United Methodist Women, advocating for opportunities for the underserved.  I have championed agriculture education and food stability through my roles with CSU Master Food Safety Advisors and Routt County 4-H youth program. I have a wide breadth of experience and knowledge and I am prepared to expand that base to work on Colorado’s redistricting. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My interest in this commission is to ensure that rural Colorado has a voice in the redistricting of Colorado that is balanced with the voice of the Front Range. I have lived on the Front Range, on the Eastern Plains (Elbert County 1986-1989), and have made my home in the mountains of the Western Slope. As a very involved community member, I am known as a GIRL SCOUT, with Courage, Confidence and Character.  My range of experiences helps me to be keenly aware of the challenges for our youth, along with experience in the “sandwich generation” parenting our parents, and active involvement with people of every age in our community.  There is a responsibility to balance those challenges with the needs for our environment, the smaller communities in rural areas and the differences, strengths and diversity evident all over our state.  I have the Courage to speak up, the Confidence to make tough decisions and I possess the Character needed to do the job right!
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
To promote consensus and create agreement, I find it helpful to listen AND hear. Mine is often a voice in a group that can iterate what another is feeling, a different view point, which necessitates listening to the voices of others and hearing the goal of the group.  Yet, I am not about “winning” unless winning means that all voices are heard and a workable solution to a problem can be reached.  It’s work, admirable work, rewarding work, and I’m prepared to be a part of that work with this Commission.  I’m someone who is willing to listen AND hear AND move things forward in a way that makes everyone feel heard.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Accounting is math.  Math is a pure form of logic.  That’s what I do to make a living.  It can be helpful to apply logic and reason to a problem. Collecting information and analyzing this to form a conclusion that I am willing to support and defend is a process that is in my comfort zone.  I believe logical thinking is improved by learning something new, by questioning a process, ensuring that a problem’s solution is healthy and by sorting out and anticipating the outcome of a decision.  I am prepared to be a part of a team that is informed, willing to stand for principles and people’s rights and to break down decisions into workable solutions for our entire state.  My work skills, coupled with my experiences in leadership with many non-profits and organizations has prepared me to be a contributing member of the team, one who is ready to share, ready to learn, ready to lead as necessary to make great outcomes happen.
