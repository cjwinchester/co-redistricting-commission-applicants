</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
donated $50 to John Hickenlooper campaign, October 2020
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Rocky Mountain Association of Environmental Professionals (RMAEP)
Hiwan Hills Homeowners Association
I have been active in a number of youth groups, including serving as a Team Manager for youths from 1st to 8th grades in the Destination Imagination program.  I have also served as a judge for the last 2 years (not including this year) for National History Day, Colorado, held at CU-Denver.

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I was recently on the board of RMAEP for three years (2015-2017).  I helped organize programs such as the yearly EnviroFest and monthly speakers and events to further the ongoing education of environmental professionals, liaise with industry and support graduating college students in starting their careers.  I also have been leader in my business organization, being the Natural Resources Group Leader for many years.  In that role, I represented colleagues from varied disciplines in discussions with senior management, including yearly performance reviews and salary raises/bonuses, which are quite contentious at times.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I moved to this state when I was just 24, to begin my adult life.  Colorado has given me so much, in particular I feel it is my identity.  I take great pride in being a Coloradan because of our independent and practical approach to so many matters, including politics.  I think this recent election has shown the country that this state is a leader, being one of the few that have mastered modern electioneering techniques  (such as mail-in ballots).  I have a vested interest in putting Colorado in the vanguard of solving the problems caused by outmoded and counter-productive practices such as gerrymandering.  Finally, even though I live on the edge of the Front Range, I treasure the myriad communities and local flavors that comprise this great state and want to protect our different experiences and points of view, even as we move forward together.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe it is magic when people of diverse backgrounds and views come together and wrestle with important issues and questions and that collaboration is the &quot;secret sauce&quot; we discover to find common ground.  I have served on three juries in my time in Colorado (two in Denver and one in Larimer County) and remember how special that feeling is when one is called to serve the greater community.  That is same feeling I have when I contemplate working on this great project, to rebuild our democracy so it is stronger and better-positioned to serve the current and future citizens of Colorado.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
By profession, I am a scientist, specifically a modeler.  I develop 3-dimensional models of groundwater flow systems and map the known and projected extents of aqueous contaminant plumes.  This is a type of problem where the true state of the system cannot be directly observed, but rather sampled sporadically at great cost, and it still requires interpretation to arrive at a best &quot;answer.&quot;  It requires iteration after iteration after iteration to arrive at a solution, which still must be defended and explained, and improved as time and money permit, which they often don&#39;t.  What this Commission is trying to do is build a model process to replace the crude instruments of partisan politics.  I would apply the same insights I use every day to characterize and solve complex problems.  I know there is rarely a unique answer to a specific problem, but by sifting through many lines of evidence and by being willing to test and select the best ideas, we can arrive at a satisfactory solution.
