</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>

University of Denver, Master of Arts, Research Methodology and Statistics, 2014

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
As an active Democrat, I have donated small amounts (less than $100) to local campaigns and efforts. I attended a fundraising event for Leslie Herod in 2017 or 2018. I also donate monthly to Blue Bench and donated to Planned Parenthood.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have served on a commission for Denver Public Schools, &quot;Strengthening Neighborhoods&quot;. Our mission was to deconstruct issues of school zones, transportation, and school closure procedures. I volunteer with Minds Matter as the Director of 10th Grade Programs; I create the scope and sequence guide for sophomores and their matched mentor pairs.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have spent 10 years advocating for equity in educational outcomes for youth in Colorado. As a teacher, I held close relationships with my student&#39;s and families&#39; community of northeast Denver, Green Valley Ranch and Montbello. The time I spent visiting families in their homes, working with students at the public library on the weekends, and hosting safe spaces during lunches to discuss race with my students propelled my passion for social justice. As a director of a nonprofit, I organized with other service providers in the same school, often working closely with organizations that competed for the same grants as mine, to better serve students and community. I set aside competition, set aside infighting, and put the needs of the school and students first. Because of that, my team, and other nonprofits were able to connect in innovative ways. We shared space, shared resources, and proved to the partner school, and our southwest Denver neighborhoods, that student success was the most important metric of our success. After I left education, I continue to volunteer and give back by joining Minds Matter. I spend 4-5 hours each week preparing lesson plans and that will reach 50 students across the Denver-metro area and Colorado Springs each.

In addition to working with youth, I am also a volunteer leadership coach with Impact Denver of the Denver Metro Chamber Leadership Foundation. I work with a group of 7 leaders, generally early in their professional careers, to support them as they complete a community-driven project. My group is currently working with Generation Schools Network to deliver on a marketing and outreach request.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to be involved with this process because it&#39;s outcome is a more just, equitable, and fair system. I have strived to create a more equitable society for my students as a teacher, I have strived to create more equitable post-secondary as a program director, and I will continue to strive to create a more just world for everyone. I have cherished my friendships with Democrats, Republicans, Independents, and everyone in between; I want to be part of this commission to honor those friendships. I have friends in Pueblo and friends in Boulder, friends in Ward County and friends in Durango, I want all of their voices to matter. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
A realistic, though often unspoken, truth of nonprofits is the the mentality of scarcity. The idea that if one program wins a grant, that means there is less money for my program to do so. This can create a toxic environment with good, well-intentioned people fighting for the same resources. In my time as a director of College Track, I was faced the challenge of balancing my own programs metrics and goals with the fact that my program&#39;s success would likely take away from others. I could have operated from a place of hoarding contacts, relationships, and building barriers for communication, but instead, I worked with as many people as I could. I worked with people whose goals were in direct opposition to mine, I worked with people who would potentially take students out of my program which would jeopardize my funding. I worked to center each conversation around what is the best outcome we can achieve? That question was not couched in best outcome for me, or the best outcome for one program, but what was the best outcome. My ability to keep a vision 5 years out, 10 years out, and beyond helps me remain balanced. I believe that mentality, that sense of teamwork, helped boost the success of not only my program, but the students we served and the other nonprofits in the same building as well.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am nothing if not logical. I believe in creating strategies and order whenever possible. Whether I am creating a scope and sequence for curriculum, or creating a workflow for projects, I try to see that outcome and work backwards from a place of success. I often ask ___ questions when working on a project:
1. What is it that I&#39;m trying to accomplish?
2. What needs to go right?
3. What cannot go wrong?
4. What are my resources, and what are my limitations?
5. What is my timeline?

I was recently asked to lead a training for the senior managers in my office about how to use Salesforce. These individuals have access to the system, but rarely interact with it. I had to two weeks to create an hour long webinar to cover topics ranging from hierarchy of data, system capabilities, data entry, and reporting. I also had to consider my audience. I knew there would be resistance to attending this training. I knew there would be little interest in it going in. I knew I had to make this relevant enough for people to engage. After getting feedback from other people in the office, I was able to deliver a product that was both useful and approachable. I was asked to do a follow-up training in January.

Looking at my previous work, you will see an 11-year history of analysis and problem-solving in each of my roles. As the Director of Data Analytics, I was constantly analyzing, reviewing, and creating content for school leaders. I was tasked with setting growth targets for all students across 6 schools based on reading and math test scores. I supported the college access team by setting goals for student to advisor meetings and number of applicants for internships. As a director at College Track, I analyzed college recruitment, acceptance, transfer, and withdrawals trends. I identified best-fit schools in Colorado for our first generation scholars. As a teacher in Denver, I developed curriculum for 6th-8th grade math and pushed my students to outpace the growth of their peers through cycling content based on daily entrance and exit tickets.
