        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Jessica Garrow</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Jessica Garrow
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Design Workshop, Planner
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Masters in City and Regional Planning, 2006, The Ohio State University, graduated with distinction BA in Political Science, 2004, University of Colorado - Boulder, graduated Summa Cum Laude Certified Planner through the American Institute of Certified Planners (AICP)
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81621
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Monetary donations to candidates, including: Millie Hamner (House District 61), 2016 Hillary Clinton (President), 2016 Dylan Roberts (House District 26), 2017 Lisa Smith (House District 17), 2019 Joe Biden (President), 2020
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am active in the planning field through the American Planning Association (APA), including as the Chair of the Small Town and Rural Planning Association (2015 - present), the Legislative and Policy Committee (2019 - present), Divisions Council (2016 - present), and the Education Committee (2017 - 2019). In these roles I advocate for land use planning policies in the state and nationally.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Until 2019 I served in local government, working as a planner and community development director in Aspen, CO. In this position I worked to understand and gather community opinions and desires through community outreach and engagement. I then worked collaboratively with city management and the City Council to enact policies and programs that would implement that community desire. I took my role as a public servant very seriously, and believe that experience in being a neutral party and listening to the facts will serve me well on the Commission.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am interested in the Legislative Commission to ensure each part of our state is fairly represented in state government. Our state is diverse and vast, and ensuring legislative districts effectively reflect this diversity is critical. Having participated in politics in 2012 as a candidate for CU Regent, I learned a great deal about the different state house and senate districts and would be honored to serve the state in the reapportionment process. I&#39;ve always believed that the best way to make an impact is at the local level, and the fair representation of local communities at the state capital is critical to our successful democracy. I believe I have applicable professional and personal experiences that will enable me to serve as a fair and impartial commission member, with a deep history and understanding of the four corners of our state. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My entire career has been based on driving consensus. As a planner, one of the many areas of my training is in consensus building. As a member of local government staff for over a decade, and now a planner in the private sector, I have built the skills in asking why and seeking to understand the reasoning behind opinions in an effort to reach consensus. I have done that as a planner charged with understanding community sentiment for a comprehensive plan update, as well as with elected officials reviewing development applications. My record as a public servant speaks to my ability to be fair and impartial. As the main arbiter of decisions related to land use code applicability in Aspen, my job was to follow the logic and data from the code and a development proposal in front of me. While some did not always like the decisions I made, they always felt they were fair and based on logic, research, and reason. If I am so fortunate as to be selected for an appointment, I look forward to serving with a diverse group of people from throughout the state seeking to create agreement on the redistricting process.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I enjoy solving thorny issues. I do this by outlining the facts before me, reading the applicable policies or laws, and then evaluating the facts against those laws. I also use precedent when it is available. I believe this reasoned approach is critical to good decision making. Sometimes, though, reasonable people can reach different conclusions when faced with the same set of facts. I enjoy those situations because it&#39;s an opportunity to learn from one another and seek understanding, and often a better outcome.
