<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I grew up in Broomfield, Colorado.  Throughout my teenage years, I was involved in a number of local causes, including a grassroots movement to ensure that the local government considered the needs of the entire community in the city planning process.  I was also a member of the Health and Human Services Advisory Board (including a task force on Sustainable Public Health) and the Civic Center Task Force in Broomfield during this time.  In these bodies, I advocated for considering the diverse needs of our community (including the needs of young people) in the realms of public health, recreation, and local commerce.  In college, I volunteered with Clinica (a group of Federally-Qualified Health Centers) and created a project to better understand the needs of community members (including those who came from low income and immigrant backgrounds), particularly in terms of how to enhance their understanding of their healthcare.  In medical school, I was a member of the Colorado Medical Society’s Council on Legislation, where I highlighted the needs of community members (our patients) when advocating for/against particular pieces of legislation that were in front of the State Legislature.  During this period, I also taught classes for single parents at Warren Village on health-related topics such as sexual education and nutrition.  The discussions held during these classes greatly informed me about the common hurdles that single parents and vulnerable children face in Denver, which is knowledge that I have used to frame my subsequent advocacy on issues of economic justice.  Starting in medical school, I have also volunteered with the Colorado Firearm Safety Coalition, helping to broaden public awareness about the epidemic of suicide, to emphasize a culture of safety at gun shops/gun ranges, and to search for the optimal role for healthcare providers in discussing important considerations around gun ownership.

Apart from the experiences above, I have been a volunteer for groups working on local issues, including The Broomfield Way and Broomfield Clean Air and Water.  As part of these groups, I advocated for the dissemination of evidence-based information about consequential projects in Broomfield as well as for accountability and transparency in government.  Over the past few years, I have also lived in rural communities in different parts of Colorado, including Springfield and Fort Morgan (where I currently work).  I have been a part of various groups in those communities, including a group to address Drug Endangered Children in Baca County, Colorado.  All of these experiences have taught me about the diverse needs of people in Colorado, and have illustrated to me the importance of fighting to ensure that those needs are addressed.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
In order for a representative democracy to function properly, I believe that we must ensure that the pillars underlying our elections are fair and just.  For me, one of those pillars is making sure that our districts are truly representative and drawn with the singular goal of addressing the needs of the people around the state.  In my work around the state, I have seen the dire, practical consequences that occur when people are not represented adequately and do not have a voice in how their governments and communities function.  Around the country, we have seen how the redistricting process can be hijacked to serve the interests of governing officials of particular political parties, not the interests of the governed.  And, in those situations, we have seen that it is the governed who suffer together.

Drawing fair, representative maps in Colorado will be our first step towards ensuring that the concerns of the governed actually come to the forefront in the legislative process.  I understand what is at stake with these maps and have seen (throughout my experiences in various communities throughout the state) what can happen when a group of citizens puts political opinions aside and attempts to tackle a problem together in a systematic, transparent, and community-oriented way.  As someone who grew up in this state and who owes everything to the community around him, I believe that it is my civic duty to participate in this process and make sure that every community around the state has their voice heard and priorities addressed during this process.  That is why I would like to serve on this commission.    
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that understanding the entire spectrum of opinions on a given issue is essential to true representation and effective advocacy.  As a volunteer for the Colorado Firearm Safety Coalition, I have been part of a diverse group of public health researchers, gun shop owners, and firearm trainers with the shared goal of promoting suicide prevention and firearm safety.  There is a broad diversity of personal opinions in this coalition, yet we all work together to fight the epidemic of suicide that is raging in our communities today through public education, emphasizing a culture of safety at gun shops/gun ranges, and creating a broader dialogue on the role of medical professionals in advising their patients who are gun owners.  During my time with this organization, I have sought out as many opportunities as possible to discuss the issues surrounding firearms with those who disagree with my opinions on the subject.  Their perspectives have prompted me to reflect a great deal on the topic and to reorient my advocacy towards more informed and practical solutions for issues related to firearm ownership.  I also learned about the importance of actively searching for common ground from the very beginning – during our discussions, I was amazed by how much scope for agreement was available.  Likewise, when I volunteered with The Broomfield Way and Broomfield Clean Air and Water, I was part of teams that advocated for basic accountability and transparency in government.  These organizations were composed of people from across the political spectrum who were all dedicated to ensuring that public officials upheld the law and that the public had access to key information about consequential projects in the community.  Within the groups, we had vastly differing perspectives on how critical issues (such as the appropriate role of oil/gas extraction and how to best tackle the issue of climate change at a local level) ought to be tackled, but, together, we were able to create an environment where we could openly discuss those diverse perspectives while agreeing on a common minimum set of standards for how the public interest should be protected.  These experiences and many more (including in more rural parts of the state) have shown me that it is possible to substantially separate the goal of serving the public interest from the politics surrounding a particular issue, which I believe to be essential for successful redistricting.  I will be able to bring that perspective to this commission.  Additionally, the experiences above will allow me to ensure that communities who often do not have a voice in statewide processes (such as remote rural communities, marginalized immigrant communities, and urban low-income communities) are listened to and that their needs are also met in this process.  My ultimate goal is to make sure that these maps properly serve my fellow Coloradans, and, in that process, I understand that fairness and impartiality are paramount – I have been able to work with these ideals in broad, diverse groups in the past and am confident that I will able to work in the same way on this commission.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Throughout my life, I have participated in a number of different groups related to a number of different issues.  This has allowed me to gain experience with learning the details of new issues while keeping a focus on the practical consequences of the overall issue for my community.  As a healthcare provider, I am confronted with new evidence (and questions around how to apply it) on a daily basis.  An important aspect of my job is figure out whether the results of a trial fit the characteristics and needs of the neighbor in front of me (my patient).  This can be quite difficult at times and requires me to approach the question systematically.  It can also involve sifting through an enormous amount of raw data and quickly understanding sources of bias and limitations.  I approach public issues much in the same way that I approach scientific/clinical questions.  Conclusions must be built based on facts and evidence, not the other way around.  We have to understand whether a proposed solution fits the needs of the diverse population around us and, if not, must make necessary adjustments to ensure that it does.  We have to critically examine the available data (and resulting conclusions) for sources of bias and uncertainty.  And, above all else, we must keep in mind that the goal of the process is to create the best outcome for our communities.  

I also have a background in quantitative and qualitative research (resulting in peer-reviewed publications).  I have created research questions to address scientific/clinical needs and have collected raw data.  I understand the importance of creating proper processes to ensure that data is accurate and representative.  Additionally, as a member of various community organizations, I have experience with budgeting, planning, and process/quality improvement.  I believe that all of the skills above will enable me to help draw maps that are evidence-based and representative, which is absolutely essential for this process to have a successful outcome.
