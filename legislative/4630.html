        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Suzanne Ethredge</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Suzanne Ethredge
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Suzanne Buksar</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Retired Educator/Union President
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Elementary Education, with other post graduate classes and training, mainly in education. I also have training in Interest Based Facilitation, Interested Based Negotiations, and Media Relations.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81004
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been politically involved through my local union, lit drops and campaign walks, both for issues and candidates. I donated this year through ActBlue to the Daneya Esgar campaign, Bri Buentello, and the Democratic Party. I donated to the Esgar and Buentello campaigns in 2018, as well. I have supported ballot initiatives that relate to public education and school board races by participating in campaigns with lit drops and signs. I have particpated in meetings with our local legislators to advocate for legislation to benefit education employees in Pueblo, as well as our Pueblo students.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Pueblo Education Association, Colorado Education Association and National Education Association. Various task forces and committees with Pueblo School District 60.


</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have been involved in organizing and representing public educators for the last thirty years, most recently as the President of the Pueblo Education Association until my retirement in May of 2020. I was an active participant in the bargaining and organizing process for 20 of those years, which involved advocating for the interests of the teachers that were members of the Pueblo Education Association. The primary advocacy related to working conditions for teachers. I also have advocated for funding and better conditions for education employees at all levels of education. I have had to balance competing interests from members with regard to political beliefs when making organizational decisions.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I would like to serve on this commission because I have long been frustrated by the scope of some of the Congressional and Legislative Districts in Colorado. I believe that some of our districts are far too large, both in population and geography for one person to serve them adequately. I would like to help change that, if possible, or to gain first hand knowledge of why it might not be possible.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As I mentioned earlier, I have had many years of experience in negotiating contracts for the teachers in Pueblo School District 60. This process is all about consensus when it works, and all about resolving differences when it doesn&#39;t. That experience has provided me with skills in consensus building with the opposite party, as well as helping those I represented to come to an agreement in accepting a contract proposal. In addition, I have had numerous trainings in the Interest Based Facilition and Bargaining Process, which is built on how to build consensus and bring parties together.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Again, I spent many years representing teachers in various areas with the school district. This required me to learn to solve issues for the whole, but also to resolve issues on an individual basis for teachers. Resolving disputes, whether they were on a larger contract scale or for an individual required me to use my analytical skills at a very high level. I also participated in various task forces and committees over the years with community members and school administrators, again requiring a significant amount of problem solving and analytical skill to be productive. I have dealt with problems from a classroom not being heated adequately, to needing to write contract language that would ensure a fair and equitable work environment for all employees, all the while having to work with the district in order to get to a solution that they would also find acceptable.
