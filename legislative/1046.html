<h5>Occupation</h5>

</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I am the first of my family to graduate from high school (Greeley Central High School, 08), and college (2012) at the University of Denver where I triple majored in political science, Spanish literature and language and international relations. I studied public spaces for half of a semester at the University of Bologna, Italy.

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I started organizing my community when I was at the University of Denver. I got involved with El Centro Humanitario para los Trabajadores where I was an intern for the Director of Organizing. I then organized high school students through Public Achievement for 3yrs where I helped them select issues that they wanted to work on and then advocate for their community based project to come to fruition. I was also on the leadership team for the DU Students for Comprehensive Immigration Reform where we organized our DU community to support immigrants and just policies. I then had an internship with Padres y Jovenes Unidos in 2011 to work on their youth institute, focusing on the school to prison pipeline. That led me to work in advocacy/organizing post graduating from DU in 2012. I worked at Stand for Children Colorado, organizing parents in Southwest Denver around issues they cared about. I then worked in 2016 with Together Colorado for 2yrs where I did school based organizing of families in Far-northeast Denver and in the Cole neighborhood. We worked on local school district issues but also tackled minimum wage increase, abolish slavery, payday loan interest, and school funding, among other things. I then left to organize former educators and current educators through Equity Network United for Metro Denver where we tackled three issues: supporting immigrant students, dismantling oppressive school practices and school funding. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I&#39;ve donated to several candidate campaigns and political organizations. I contribute monthly to Emerge Colorado so that they can recruit and coach women to run for office. I&#39;ve contributed to NARAL Colorado. I&#39;ve contributed to Julie Gonzales who ran for office, Jen Bacon for State House, Angela Cobian for when she ran for school board (DPS). I&#39;ve donated to CIRC, Colorado Peoples Alliance.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am a volunteer co-chair of the Young Latino Philanthropist (giving circle that provides grants throughout the state). I was appointed to the ACCESO Spanish Advisory Board for the Clerk and Recorder of Denver to help with Spanish-speaking outreach. I was appointed by the Mayor of Denver to the Denver Immigrant and Refugee Commission and was a founding commissioner that helped write the bylaws. I was on the Philanthropic Leadership Committee through the Denver Foundation. I was also appointed to the Denver Parks and Recreation Board by Mayor Hancock as well. I am a former Board member of New Leaders Council. I am currently on the c3 board for the Colorado Peoples Alliance. I was elected twice to the Denver Young Democrats executive board. I was on the Asbury Elementary CSC committee. Founding board member of the Padres y Jovenes Unidos Action Fund (c4).  Former Board member of Launch Progress. I am on the board of directors for Ricardo Flores Magon Academy. I was on the alumni board for the Puksta Scholarship. I was also on the Denver Foundation non-profit internship program selection committee. I also have coached recreational and competitive youth soccer with the Colorado Rapids Youth Soccer Club (post leaving the club) and C&amp;C youth soccer club where my U10 girls team came in third in their division at the Vail Cup. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the commission because I care deeply about the ppl of the state of Colorado and want to lend my voice and support to make sure that redistricting is an equitable process. I also believe that my experiences can be an asset to the commission, having grown up in northern Colorado and having done work throughout the state.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am a community organizer and with that I know that for the work to move forward, you need to be able to move past differences, find a common ground and compromise. I would promote consensus by reminding folks that we were selected to represent the ppl of Colorado and that it behooves us to make sure we come to a consensus equitably and reminding ourselves that there is a lot at stake. I also believe strongly in the organizing principle that goes: when in doubt, have a one to one. If someone is in disagreement or there are tensions on the commission, reach out to that person and have a one to one to understand where they are coming from.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As an organizer, my job is to solve for a problem. I had moments where I had to tackle a problem from many different angles, while guiding my team through the campaign and ensuring that they are successful.
