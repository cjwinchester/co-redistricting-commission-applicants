<h3>Contact Information</h3>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>

  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a Partner and Co-Chair of the Securities Litigation Practice Group at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP.  I have practiced at Gibson Dunn for the past 18 years where I represent and advise clients on various litigation matters, focused primarily on securities litigation, investigations, and corporate governance.

</p>

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am a member of the Colorado Republican Party and the Colorado Chapter of the Federalist Society, and my involvement is generally limited to attending panel presentations of interest.  Since November 10, 2015, I have made contributions to The Lincoln Project, Defeat by Tweet, and Goutam Jois for Congress (a friend and former colleague in New Jersey).
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Disability Law Colorado - Board of Directors  (President 2017-2018; Executive committee 2015-current)
American Bar Association - Co-Chair Accounting Issues Subcommittee of Securities Litigation Committee

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My experience in this area is focused generally in the disability community, education, and lawyer organizations focused on improving diversity in the profession.  I have served for many years as a Board member of Disability Law Colorado, including as Vice President for two years, President for two years, and now as a continuing member of the Executive Committee.  DLC is the protection and advocacy organization for our state and home to the state&#39;s long-term care ombudsman and legal assistance developer for the elderly.  DLC is a wonderful organization, staffed by a tremendously talented group of professionals that advocate for and empower Coloradoans.  In my various roles on the DLC Board, I have provided guidance and oversight with respect to the organization&#39;s mission, governance, and financial stability.  I have also been involved in the charter school movement.  After enrolling our children in a wonderful Douglas County charter school and volunteering our time with the school, I was motivated to join a board comprised of dedicated parents in an effort to open a charter high school in the area.  While I rolled off the board and the effort did not ultimately succeed, it was an encouraging experience working with other parents in the community and the School District Board and staff.  I am also involved in a number of professional organizations here in Colorado and across the nation and am particularly interested in those activities that improve diversity in the legal profession, including hosting women’s events and volunteering as a mentor for those interested in pursuing the legal profession.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am passionate about our democracy – the checks and balances, the rule of law, the guarantee of due process.  These systematic protections are meant to ensure fundamental fairness as both the perception and existence of fairness are necessary to our democracy’s endurance.  The mere perception of favoritism—bending the rules, trading on privilege—undermines our faith that the system is fair, eroding the foundation for our system of government.  This independent process is designed precisely to restore and preserve that faith.  These commissions have a tremendous opportunity to lead by example – to dispose of partisan politics and prove that those of differing political views can come together to evaluate information and data, deliberate and debate courses of action, and through an informed and open process come to consensus on critically important issues.  It would be an absolute privilege and honor to serve the public as a commissioner. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Consensus is essential to nearly every successful endeavor, and a process that promotes informed deliberation is key.  When stakeholders are heard and their opinions respected in a free and open exchange of ideas, it is easier to identify common ground or principles and then build from that foundation.  My own management style is centered on collaboration and inclusion; I seek out views and opinions from every member of the team, regardless of seniority, and encourage healthy debate and active engagement by the entire team.  I would bring this same approach to my work on the commission.  I will be entirely fair and impartial and act only with the best interests of the electorate in mind.   
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Notwithstanding some very fine lawyer jokes to the contrary, lawyers really do have a knack for logic.  My eighteen years in the profession, including trying and litigating high-stakes, complex commercial matters, have provided me an opportunity to hone and refine my analytical skills.  I am very comfortable analyzing complex statistical and financial data and related information, distilling that information to identify meaningful insights and important trends, and applying those observations to the relevant law or rubric.
