Fellow of th eAmerican Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. member American Association of Hip, and Knee Surgeons. Board member of my medical group and Center at Centennial (see below). Member Colorado Mountain Club.
I left California in 1993 for Colorado Springs but while there I was a volunteer at the Lestonnac Free Clinic in Orange, California as well as a volunteer faculty member of the University of California Irvine Medical School. I helped to voluntarily staff the orthopedic clinic at the Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Orange County I was the volunteer team physician for California State Polytechnic University, Pomona athletic program for a number of years before moving to Colorado Springs.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I do believe logical rational thought is one of my strong suits as well as fair problem solving. Todays environment requires common sense and flexibility.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have taken multiple courses in leadership over the years and am well versed in the concept of &quot;Difficult Conversations&quot; as well as &quot;Truth to Power&quot;. I am patient, have an even temper and believe in hearing all sides. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My medical work life required ascertaining the facts. identifying the problems to which the facts point  and developing a plan to deal with the situation. This sometimes meant balancing multiple issues and prioritizing them. As a long term board member of my medical group it was imperative to go through the same processes but with administrative rather than medical issues. Then again as Medical Director of the Specialists it was my job to carefully explain the administration&#39;s positions to the 23 providers for whom I was responsible and visa versa, and then  to come to consensus agreement. I happened to do so meanwhile retaining  respect of both sides. I am a board member of the Center at Centennial Acute Rehab Hospital (known for the highest rating from Medicare) which also requires the above mentioned skills. 
 I do believe I have the ability to sit back, appraise a situation and tease out the essence of the matter. This must be followed by a congenial discussion with others of the group.
 I just found out about this position on 6 Nov 2020 and will try to get some references from busy people. Also, I have had the same job since 1993 and have not needed so nor do I have a CV. Thank you.
