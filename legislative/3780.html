<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I do not recall donating to any political campaigns or organizations in the past five years
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have had quite a few roles in active, if small, organizations in Colorado. As a Member of Alpha Phi Omega, a Coed Service Fraternity, I ran Merit Badge University-an event in which Boy Scouts from around the state came to campus at CU-Boulder and took Merit Badge classes from college students, giving them the opportunity to earn three badges, including badges focusing on Civic Development, during their day on campus. In this role I had to meet with representatives of the University and justify the event taking place, secure campus space, develop a detailed safety and reporting plan, and develop a fire escape plan. This was in addition to coordinating with several Boy Scout Districts and Troops across the state and recruiting and managing a team of volunteers to provide this option to the Scouts. As a member of the Vestry (parish council) at St. Aidan’s Episcopal Church in Boulder I work with my fellow Vestry Members to oversee activities at the Parish, including making financial decisions. In this role I have analysed bids, helped create a budget, and helped make difficult financial decisions for our parish during the COVID-19 crisis. As a Board Member of Bowing for Change, an organization dedicated to supporting education related initiatives in South Asia, I helped raise over $1,500.00 dollars from community members in Boulder and Denver to fund the installation of a new water filtration system at a school in rural Sri Lanka.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the Commission because I am excited about the balanced approach that having a multi-partisan commission of Colorado residents represents. I believe that having districts drawn in a way that will reflect the lived experiences and interests of Coloradoans, as opposed to those of party leadership, will help to bridge the divides we see in our current political and societal climate. As a student in the Leeds School of Business at CU-Boulder I had the opportunity to take an independent study course with a professor and another student. The goal of our study was to examine the business of sustainable agriculture and particularly why there seemed to be resistance to implementing these practices among American farmers. What we learned was that for many American farmers the investment required to transform their farms was well out of reach. It shocked me to learn that the median farm income in 2018 was -$1,735.00 and many agricultural families rely on supplemental non-farm income to make ends meet, so it was no wonder why they looked at the sometimes expense recommendations of environmental researchers with suspicion. Growing up in the greater Denver Metro area I was insulated from the problems faced by these problems faced by those outside of our state’s Front Range communities and felt that these folks were not doing enough to confront the shared challenges we faced as a state, particularly water use and climate change. However, after doing research and speaking with agricultural experts in our state I learned about the pressures that folks outside of the front range that are increased by the development and increased resource requirements caused by growth from Fort Collins, Boulder, Denver, Aurora, and Colorado Springs. I think that it is crucial that Commission members are able to learn about and recognize the challenges faced by folks from different parts of our state. This is the approach that I would bring to the commission, bringing my own experiences to the table and seeking to learn more about the realities of life from around Colorado. I firmly believe that the mandate of the Commission is to draw our Congressional districts in such a way that all residents of our state are represented, not partisan ambitions. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that my experiences on the Vestry at St. Aidan’s Episcopal Church and on the Board of Alpha Phi Omega would serve me well in promoting consensus among commissioners. Our Vestry has had to confront the financial difficulties of the COVID-19 crisis head on, and this can create disagreement on how to move forward. In addition, we have had to make the decision to remain almost wholly virtual for worship during the pandemic, being forced to weigh our fervent desire to engage with the sacramental life of our tradition with the health of our parishioners and our wider community. This has led to conflict as we have to reach a consensus to balance these two objective goods and chart a course for our congregation. One of my roles on the Executive Board of Alpha Phi Omega was Sergeant at Arms; in this role I was responsible for conducting the meetings of our wider organization and those of the executive board. These meetings could get rather contentious particularly when discussing our bylaws and finances. As Sergeant at Arms I had to balance the speaking time and contributions of competing groups, ensuring that all members were heard and respected while enforcing parliamentary procedure. This role was valuable in that it taught me to put my personal feelings aside and focus on promoting good discussion and debate among our members. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I pride myself on using logic and reason to overcome problems and reach solutions. I have shown this in my involvement on the boards I have been on in a variety of community organizations. On the Vestry we have had to navigate the difficulties presented by the COVID-19 crisis, both qualitative and quantitative. Decisions to stay virtual during this crisis and who to allow to use our space has led to disagreements over objective goods that can lead to quite emotional arguments. During these conversations I do my best to look at these problems through a logical and data driven approach whenever possible, while acknowledging the feelings and perspectives of others. I will be able to apply this approach on the commission as I would seek to work with my commission colleagues to find the best solution for Colorado residents.
