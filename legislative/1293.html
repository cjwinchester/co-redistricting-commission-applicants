<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
As a Fire Chief we had to ask for a mill levy increase 8 years ago and this required listening to the public concerns on operations and the level of service expected.  Two year ago the district organized a De-Bruce and and De-Gallagher initiative and passed.  We routine help neighborhoods collaborate to form Community Wildfire Protection Plan and work with the variety of interest in communities.  We also have a Government Finance Officers Certification of Excellence this was done to address concerns of interest groups over the fire district&#39;s finances.  We are part of a Federal program to advocate for patient care in emergency medical service and monthly do customer surveys.  Lead the initiative for LaPlata County to get their original Hazard Assessment done and a wild fire planning initiative.  Assisted, lead and secure a FEMA grant for a neighborhood for a new bridge, oddly yes a fire district building a bridge but no one else would help this subdivision.  Routinely advocating for safety topics injury and wild fire protection.  Lately advocating for a National Mentoring Program for Fire and EMS people.  
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
One $1000 donation to a PAC affiliated with the National Association of EMT&#39;s that lobbies for issues around emergency medical services.  Have participated with EMS Day on the Hill in both Colorado and the Federal Level annual educating Congress and the State Legislature on EMS related issues.  As a Fire District hosted a debate among two candidates J P Brown and Mike McLaughlin on public safety issues.

LaPlata County Suicide Prevention Collaborative, National Association of EMT&#39;s, Emergency Medical Services Association of Colorado, Colorado Fire Chiefs Association.  President Elect of the National Association of EMT&#39;s.  Previously served two terms on the Governors EMS and Trauma Advisor Committee and now on the State Child Death Review Team.  Board Member of the SIlver San Juan Division of the National Model Railroaders Association.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Have always been raise to be a servant leader and enjoyed the opportunities given to me by the Governors to sit and help with State sanctioned advisory committees.  A civic project to demonstrate to my 15 year old son that in your life you should give back more than you take.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my Master&#39;s Degree in Public Administration we trained on a program called &quot;Getting to Yes&#39; and Getting Past No&quot;.  Often there are times where a break is very important to cool off and let emotional intelligence have time to process.  I would tell you the secret sauce in the firehouse is teams are built around the dinner table in the environment of very diverse people.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Have written a book on quality improvement and research, routinely analyzing response time date and demographics is a monthly or weekly event.  For FEMA I have written a research course and a quality improvement course for the National Emergency Training Center.  This involved the DMIAC process and my fire agency is currently involved with a research project with Yale and Children&#39;s Colorado on Pediatric Care.  Our Fire District routinely publishes an annual report looking at our performance and data.  Very failure with data analysis when it comes to validity and reliability and test of statistical significance.
