<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>

  Lynne R. Spence
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Lynne R. Spence</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Independent Contractor for Furniture Manufacturers.  Largest was Serta Mattress.  I represented them and a few other smaller companies.  My volume was 2.7 million wholesale yearly.  I was chosen one of 5 representatives to start a new division of Serta Mattress.  I had 2 employees that I paid, along with all my other expenses regarding car, overnight and attending markets in Las Vegas and Denver.  I traveled the entire state of Colorado.  I had 50 - 70 accounts.  I got to know owners of the stores and their staff, heard their concerns about their business and location.  Stores varied throughout the state, catering to Minorities, Mountain, Military,   Ranchers and Denver Metro.  I was very successful in this role.  Colorado was usually in the top 2 - 3 sales in the country, even though my territory usually had 1/3 - 1/2 the population of other territories.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Bachelor of Science, Colorado State University, degree in business/marketing
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80123
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated small amounts, ($25 - $50 each) to several people running for office, Cory Gardner, Matt Durkin, Joni Inman, Due Date Too Late, I&#39;m a Trumpster.  
I also periodically had Tapas and Topics/Wine and Tapas meetings at my house.  Purpose was to have a very relaxed meeting for the purpose of education.  They were not fundraisers.  I would not endorse anyone at these meetings.  I had competing candidates attend, (not on the same day).  I had elected officials attend.  I probably had about 15 meetings over 3 years.  Attendance was 25 - 35.  The largest meeting in my back yard was 50.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Angels of Mercy, Bridge Church at Bear Creek.  Purpose is to bring food, cards or just visit people who are sick or disabled.
United States Tennis Association, I have been tennis captain for about 20 out of the 25 years I was a member.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I organized Tapas and Topics/Wine and Tapas on my own.  The purpose is to educate myself along with others regarding the political concerns of people in Colorado.  I served beverages and appetizers at my own expense.  Many people brought some food/beverages to help.  I was motivated to do this after attending Kim Monson&#39;s group in Lone Tree.  Her motto was: Let&#39;s not discuss what is right vs left.  Let us discuss what is right vs wrong.  Agree or disagree, let&#39;s have a conversation.   Since I live about 10 miles away, I thought it would be good to have one on my side of town.  I have done this for about 3 years.  I have probably had about 15 of these.  Attendance is usually 25 - 35.  My largest group in the back yard was 50. 
Also, I was tennis captain 20 out of the 25 years I was a member of the United States Tennis Association.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want our districts to be fair and balanced, to represent the people living in those areas.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I enjoy all points of view.  I enjoy getting to know people, listening to their concerns and understanding their perspective.  I ran a business as a factory representative for several companies, the largest was Serta Mattress.  As a factory representative, you are the middle person between the factory and the store.  When confronting a problem, the 2 sides do not always agree.  Many times I had to work a compromise, or have one side change their mind and go with the other sides concern.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
First facts and numbers usually needed  when looking at a problem.  Then listening to both perspectives.  As I listed above, as an Independent Contractor for Furniture Companies, I was the middle person between the factory and the store.  Problems occurred.  Often times the factory resolve was different than the store.  I would need to get a compromise, or have one side modify their perspective to solve the problem.
