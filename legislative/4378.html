<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have remained politically unbiased with no direct donations or supports to any campaigns since my employment began in 2007 due to the nature of my work in housing, wherein Elected Officials are the appointed members of the Housing Authority.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am an appointee for my community of Eagle-Vail to the Upper Eagle Regional Water Authority board, as Secretary. I served on the EagleVail Metro District for a 2 year term since 2015. I am involved with my local church, school and housing organizations. That list includes Eagle River Presbyterian Church, Homestake Peak (dual language) School, Colorado Mountain Housing Coalition, Housing Colorado, Colorado Realtors Association, Vail Board of Realtors and The Valley Home Store.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have worked since 2007 to advocate for local affordable deed restricted for rent and for sale housing in our municipalities, county and in partnership with state wide organizations in my professional capacity. In doing this work, I recognize a disparity in rural communities, and families of color who are at a disadvantage in affordable housing and health care. I have built coalitions of local organizations who can serve the needs of our entire community, and found that working together makes us stronger and more valuable.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on this commission to represent the rural, Western slope, resort focused communities, who have vastly different needs that much of the state. I believe having a diverse perspective is imperative to bringing new voices to the conversation on a statewide level. The state of Colorado must consider more diversity and inclusion as we grow into our next stage of who we will be when we grow up. My experience working in housing and having my children attend a dual language learning public school has given me a new perspective on our potential. Additionally, I am skilled at critical, analytical thinking on a big picture scene. I would be thrilled to serve my state by working hard and sharing those skills.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Consensus building is a difficult task, but achieved by active listening and thoughtful consideration. The biggest challenge would be to get helpful feedback from the communities across the state. After taking these factors into consideration, impartial decisions would be achieved through slow and deliberate thinking and consideration of a multitude of perspectives. I am able to do this impartial decision making daily in my work, and with my family. Fairness is inherent in my family and working life, as we solve problems each and every day.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
When I grow up, I wish to be Ruth Bader Ginsberg. Her quiet leadership and thoughtful analysis is my mantra and goal in my work and with my family. I understand the importance of active listening, before analyzing the data to seek the most logical solution, but first building consensus towards that solution with teamwork. This is no easy task, but the best working groups have these skills. I would find it imperative to work with fellow commissioners in this way.
