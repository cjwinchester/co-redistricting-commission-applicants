<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Blake L. Mayberry
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Associate Professor of Geography, Red Rocks Community College
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  BA (2004, w/Honors), Geography and Urban Studies, University of Iowa MA (2008), Geography, University of Nebraska, Omaha PhD (2014), Geography, University of Kansas I worked as an urban planner in the Omaha metropolitan area from 2004 to 2006, and worked part time as a consultant while in graduate school, also serving in various volunteer capacities due to my urban planning background. Since 2014 I have been serving as a member of the Planning Commission in the City of Golden, an appointed, non-partisan position where I advise elected officials and planning staff on growth and land use development issues.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>

  80401
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Most of my past political activity has occurred at the municipal level, and has thus been nonpartisan in nature. I was briefly appointed to a vacant city-council position in Silver City, IA, but did not stand for reelection. In 2006, I was part of an ballot-measure campaign in Glenwood, IA to create a municipal telecommunication utility; I was the City Planner for the town at the time, and was representing the city&#39;s interests in advocating for the ballot measure, which was ultimately unsuccessful. As a member of the Loess Hills Preservation Society - an environmental nonprofit based out of Council Bluffs, IA - I worked with the Obama Campaign in 2008 to bring volunteers to a prairie restoration event at Vincent Bluff Preserve; our organization was approached by campaign staffers about the event, the LHPS was importantly a nonpartisan group; our restoration event was previously scheduled, they tagged along for the photo op! Currently, I serve as an appointed member of the City of Golden Planning Commission, a nonpartisan, non elected role that demands me to provide impartial, factual advise to City Council. Aside from that, my political activity is limited to voting and an occasional letter/email to an elected official. I have not donated money to any campaigns or political organization since 11/10/15.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
City of Golden Planning Commission
American Association of Geographers
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My service on the City of Golden Planning Commission has been supported by my employer - I satisfy my community requirement in my contract, in part, by serving on this local board. In my application, and reappointment, I stressed to elected officials who were appointing me that I view my role as being an advocate for student, young people, and lower income residents - demographic groups that make up a large share of our student body at RRCC, and who traditionally lack representation and find participation in local government difficult. First and foremost, I view my role as an appointed member of local government is providing objective, expert knowledge and experience - to be an advisor, and one who stays away from partisanship and ideology. But, I also feel a duty to provide a voice to be people who are traditionally left out of local decision-making processes, and my role as a college professor helps me bridge that gap - providing my expert analysis on land use issues, but also trying to advocate for a group whom I work with on a daily basis.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
For many years, I have been teaching my students about the importance of redistricting to our democratic system of self-governance. I&#39;ve given talks on campus and participated in roundtable discussions prior to elections, I&#39;ve been asked by Student Government to talk about the important of public service and volunteering. I&#39;ve developed assignments that task students with the very same thing the Colorado Redistricting Commission does, and introduces them not only to this important aspect of our democracy, but also teaches them some geospatial skills as well. And I come from a family where it was a duty to serve your community, and your nation. So service is something that comes to me like breathing. I am nearing the end of my second term with the City of Golden, so I naturally was looking for other opportunities. With the election nearing this fall, I taught my unit on redistricting, as I usually do, and in showing my students the Colorado Redistricting Commission website, one of my students said &quot;Dr. Mayberry, they are looking for volunteers - you should apply.&quot; They often say stupid things! But then, today, my dean, a man I respect and whose opinion I hold in utmost regard, sent me an email and said &quot;you should apply.&quot; So, in a way, I feel called to it. And the opportunity also comes at a time when I will be able to devote more of my energies to a new and exciting endeavor that calls on my background and expertise in geography, geospatial science, and urban growth, but this time in service of the state of Colorado, and not just my local community.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Being an urban planner is a unique education in building consensus - we are tasked with bringing together diverse groups of stakeholders, from landowners to homeowners to politicians and business interests, and getting everyone to support a common vision, for a project, for a community plan, or a policy. I tell my students that I was fit for that line of work because I could talk everyone&#39;s language, so to speak - partly, urban planners are taught strategies for consensus building, but I also grew up in a small town outside of a big city, surrounded by people from all different walks of life. My folks were professionals who worked in Omaha (my father an engineer, my mother an inner-city school teacher), my neighbors were mechanics and construction workers or farmers. So I grew up in a place that afforded me an ability to see life from a lot of different angles. As an urban planner, I had to be able to relate to and understand the concerns of homeowners affected by a large development project. But I also had to be able to talk technical jargon with the engineers, and understand the political pressures elected officials faced from various constituencies, and even be able to relate to the guy pouring concrete into forms on a jobsite. When I returned to grad school, I spent time learning the methods of ethnography - my dissertation research was an investigation into prairie restoration, specifically, what motivated volunteers and professional biologists/ecologists to get involved in ecological restoration - so I learned in a more scientific way, the skills that most of the best urban planners come by naturally: how to listen, how to actually hear what people are saying, what feelings, emotions and values they are communicating through their discourse. Part of being a social scientist is understanding human behavior without passing judgment. Coincidentally, that is a great definition of consensus building as well - being able to see someone else&#39;s point of view without passing judgment, and being able to communicate your own point of view in a language that speaks to others&#39; concerns, values, and motivations. My track record, most recently, on the City of Golden Planning Commission, speaks to my ability to build consensus and find agreement even in the midst of division - despite enduring a contentious political environment opposed to growth and development, and working in a community that has a growth restriction policy in place, our seven-member board rarely had split votes, even on the most controversial of projects, and we all worked tremendously hard to work through contentious discussions, but do so in a way that almost always ended in a consensus. I grew up in a small town, so I know the dangers of working on contentious local policy issues - those intense discussions often spill over to the local brewery, or the neighbor&#39;s backyard - but one of the things I am most proud of my service, both in Golden and in other places I have lived, is my ability to remain impartial and objective. There are a lot folks who disagree with some of the decisions I&#39;ve made or stances I&#39;ve taken, especially with respect to advocating for affordable housing reforms, but my integrity as an impartial advisor giving advice based on facts has never been questioned. My unanimous re-appointment, by a council made up of majority newly-elected councilors, in 2018, I think speaks to how my fairness and impartiality are valued, even by elected officials who disagree with me on important land use issues.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have a strong background in statistics, demography, and geospatial analysis. I can use ESRI GIS software, as well as open-source programs like QGIS. I work with census data regularly, both in my role as an educator, and as an urban planner. I really enjoy teaching about the scientific method in geography, because I think looking at problems spatially makes causes, and solutions, much more logically apparent. I always tell my students: for geographers, the most important question is &quot;where?&quot; because, if we can answer that question, the &quot;where&quot; of something usually provides clues to the &quot;why&quot; of that thing. Where do blue spruce trees grow in Colorado? That map, showing where blue spruce trees grow, tells us very clearly that mountains play a role, and that leads us to a plethora of other questions - is it rainfall? temperature? bedrock geology? Solving any problem is an iterative process like that, we always have to be asking questions and being critical of our process, so that we can anticipate any variables that might be affecting the problems that we haven&#39;t considered yet. Being an social scientist gives me that perspective. Being a geography provides the unique perspective of focusing on space first, which I have found to a valuable, and often overlooked, aspect of public policy making. I often hear &quot;you know, Blake, I never thought of it that way before.&quot; That tells me I am either weird, or I look at problems in a different than most people (or both!?).
