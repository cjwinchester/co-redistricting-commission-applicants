<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated to the Bernie Sanders campaign in 2016, and again in 2020.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Denver Asian American Pacific Islander Commission- Vice Chair, 
Denver COVID-19 Racial Equity Council- Councillor, 
Colorado Asian Culture and Education Network- Program Manager, 
COVID-19 Asian Response Committee- Member,

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have worked as a community organizer for the Asian American Pacific Islander community for over ten years. Unfortunately, the AAPI community is not a monolith as suggested by the name. The umbrella term AAPI covers dozens of ethnicities, and hundreds of languages meaning that the needs for each specific community vary greatly. It has been an incredible learning experience to discover all of the different communities and how they can be served. This has led me to charter the first and only Asian-interest sorority in Denver, Kappa Phi Lambda, and serve in a variety of leadership roles for the AAPI community as a whole, including but not limited to Program Manager for the Colorado Asian Culture and Education Network, and Vice-Chair for the Denver Asian American Pacific Islander Commission. 


Furthermore, in my work with the U.S. Census Bureau, I have made connections with and have continued to serve hard-to-count populations including the AAPI community, LGBTQIA+ community, indigenous community, and refugee communities in general. The work required me to build trust with each population, and encourage them to fill out the 2020 Census- something they may not have heard of before, or did not want to fill out due to their distrust of the government. I was able to organize several information sessions for community leaders, and Census awareness events in partnership WITH community leaders. Statewide, we were able to create an overarching AAPI Complete Count Committee (a CCC includes several community leaders that meet regularly to discuss strategies in getting out the count). Additionally, I was able to help create a Cambodian Complete Count Committee and Hmong Complete Count Committee, both of which are underserved populations. Within the Bureau and to my colleagues, I continually advocated for my community as a whole and helped them understand the different approaches needed for each cultural group. This led me to work on Asian American, Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander, and Native American communities on a more national scale. Without a doubt, my mission has and will continue to be to make sure those that are underrepresented have an opportunity to have a voice in our country.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My mother grew up in Vietnam during the war. She always wanted to stand up to fight for what she believed in against the dictatorial government, however never did for fear of death- not for herself, she was more than willing to sacrifice her life for equality- but of her family and friends. Born and raised in America, it is not only my right, but my duty to advocate for equality, justice, and fairness. 


As a Partnership Specialist with the U.S. Census Bureau, I was very involved in ensuring that we were able to get a complete and accurate count of the U.S. population. This data is used for reapportionment, redistricting, and the allocation of billions of dollars. It made logical sense for me to continue to follow the data to make sure that accurate and fair maps were drawn.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Being immersed in several communities, I have often had to balance competing values and perspectives from various stakeholders. With my background in Anthropology, building rapport with communities vastly different from your own is key to research. I have completed development work in both Cambodia and Malaysia that have challenged me to build trust with community leaders and entrench myself with the varying values of these neighborhoods. Working in Cambodia, I spent a lot of time with former gang members. Coming from the suburbs in Colorado, I knew that my background would not be impressive to them. And so, it was important that I was able to gain their agreement in sharing intimate details of their lives with me. By being upfront and sincere, I was able to have all of them agree together to support my research. 


More recently with the U.S. Census Bureau, I was able to work with several disparate communities in order for them to agree to a common goal. Like mentioned in a previous answer, the AAPI community is not a monolith and lumping them together into one meant that there would be a natural discord in the group. By helping leaders re-focus on the goal and the end game, I was able to successfully engage different groups that did not initially see the benefit of working together.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I excel in both logical reasoning, as well as emotional intelligence. This balance allows me to view a problem through several lenses. I have notable experience in database management and analytics, qualitative research, and community organizing giving me a unique ability to not only listen and empathize with other perspectives, but to also apply critical thinking and reasoning to any issue. 


Furthermore, I am creative by nature and able to view things from an imaginative lens. I have experience in strategic planning for my own organization, APIDA 4 Black Lives Matter. Through my organization and other opportunities, I have taught several conflict management workshops and trainings focused on engaging in difficult conversations, giving me a personal and practiced insight on team mediation
