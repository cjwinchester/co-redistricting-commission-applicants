<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have participated in the electoral process going back to fall 2008 when I was in college.

I have been engaged in a variety of Democratic leaning activities since then by volunteering on campaigns, donating money and volunteering with causes.

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Sierra Club
Colorado Democratic Party
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
In my volunteer capacity with Sierra Club’s Our Wild America and the Colorado Sierra Club’s outdoor programs the first and foremost thing we have focused on is how we build community by using the Jemez Principles to organize. That includes the 100 plus volunteers through our Outdoor Leadership Workshop that I helped train with a lens of equity to how we build a more inclusive outdoor recreation space, especially within a predominantly white organization. We also used our work to protect public lands as an opportunity to bring voices that our typical audience did not hear from to speak about the perspectives of their identities and what actions folks can do to advance a more inclusive and just public lands movement.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have long wanted to bridge political divides and one lesser known way to do that is through creating legislative maps that represents communities and removes partisanship from the process. Being a part of the redistricting commission is an exciting opportunity to build a consensus map that is as just as it can be and serves the people of Colorado for the next decade. It is not about creating an advantage for one political group or another. I’ve had a deep desire to serve in this capacity to help heal our nation and this is one tool available to us to do just that. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Gerrymandering has been around for a long time, well before 2012 when the discussions around it were elevated. Voters have approved here in Colorado and across the country these bipartisan redistricting commissions that help remove political agendas around them. It’s critical that not only myself, but others represent the people of Colorado in creating fair maps that truly represent the richness of thoughts and identities from all four corners. I have no intention of serving on the commission to advantage one party or another. My way of building consensus is first listening to the voices of the public, then listening to my colleagues on the commission and the expert staff. It is critical then to work together with what is best for Colorado. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Not only have I been engaged in politics for over 10 years I have now had a professional career in geospatial analytics for just as long. My day job as a Senior Land Geospatial and Analytics Specialist is centered on building business solutions centered on maximizing value in spatial relationships of data. I work daily with spatial data and believe this skill set will be a welcomed attribute to a commissioner in the process that will include the need to consume spatial data, ask questions, support all commissioners in diving deeper into the data, since it can be made to show what you want. It is critical to understand the data and help to solve the problem of gerrymander and to ensure the data either from the state or even maps submitted by organizations reflect the desire of the public to be non-partisan and promote equitable and just maps that don’t favor one party or the other.
