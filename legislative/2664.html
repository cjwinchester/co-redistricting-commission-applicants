   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Kelly Leviker
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a landscape architect, but I am not currently employed beyond looking after a toddler.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  My highest level of education is a Master of Landscape Architecture from the University of Melbourne in Australia. My undergraduate degree is a Bachelor of Arts with majors in Russian Language and Arabic Literature and Language from the University of Sydney also in Australia. I also studied at the University of British Columbia for one year at the bachelor level. I studied abroad during my bachelor’s at Moscow State University in Russia and Notre Dame University in Beirut, Lebanon. I have also taken several classes at the Denver Botanical Gardens for botanical illustration. I hope to one day complete the full botanical illustration degree.

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Since returning to Colorado, I have been actively trying to increase my personal engage with democracy, which I do not take for granted, having lived in Russia and Ethiopia. Therefore, I try to make phone calls and write letters whenever I hear of potential legislation or issues that I believe need to be changed. Within the past half year, I have become increasingly focused on work with Canada Geese Protection Colorado. It has been fascinating to witness how with continual perseverance, change is starting to happen. The group is now allowed to attend biweekly meetings, which ensures increased transparency. Denver Parks and Recreation has agreed for us to help set up a task force, which I will probably be a member of, regarding this issue. They have also said that there will probably be no further culling next year. I have learned that change needs persistence and governmental systems need to be understood to be effective.

</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am politically active, but not in an official capacity. I have voted in every election since being of age. I donated to several democratic campaigns in the past year, including: Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, and most recently to the Democrats in Georgia to help flip the Senate. Before this year, I do not believe that I have donated to other political campaigns. I often write letters and call political leaders when there is legislation to be decided and I want my voice heard regarding that legislation. I have been doing this for years, including while I lived abroad. Lately, I have been regularly active in campaigning to end the culling of geese and for more transparency in the city of Denver. Through this process, I have become more aware of how the City Council, Denver Parks and Recreation, and the Mayor’s office operate. Together with other advocates, we are working to set up a community science group to watch the lakes and learn more about the geese. While living in Moscow, Russia, I volunteered with an organization that helps forced migrants and refugees, where I taught English on a weekly basis. I later started volunteer translating for the European Court for Human Rights. For this position I would translate legal documents from Russian into English that would be presented to the Court. The vast majority of these cases were against the Russian Federation.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am an active member of Canada Geese Protection Colorado. I am also a founding member of an internet group called Ethiopian Architecture and Urbanism. I was in the Chair of Landscape Architecture at the Ethiopian Institute of Architecture, Building Construction, and City Development. There, I wrote the curriculum, launched, and lectured in the first degree for landscape architecture within Ethiopia.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have wanted to contribute to the democratic process with my renewed admiration for democracy since returning to the US. I am specifically interested in serving on the commission, because the issue of redistricting has become so controversial nationally. I feel this community-generated commission is a genuine opportunity to change that narrative and move away from a non-productive, hyper partisan country. I also see great potential for this commission to become best practice nation-wide. I believe that this century will present unimaginable challenges and the current atmosphere in the country is toxic and will debilitate us a nation to respond to these challenges, unless we decrease the partisanship. We need to rebuild trust in community, institutions, and professionalism. I also don’t believe the level of partisanship within this country is inevitable, as I do not think that I have experienced such deep partisanship in other countries that I have lived. Finally, I believe I have useful qualifications for this position. Since returning to the US, I have wanted to contribute to the democratic process with my renewed admiration for democracy.

<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have spent nearly the entirety of my adult life living, studying, and working amongst different cultures and people often with opposing beliefs and values. I feel that the most important aspects to understanding and appreciating a culture or person different from you is deep listening and being open to what is being said. Therefore, I would use this same approach when beginning to promote consensus amongst the commissioners. However, as the process proceeds, the position I form will be based upon facts. Therefore, I would not approach this task with the aim of trying to convince others about my beliefs or political views, but rather about the facts and what they indicate. Therefore, responding to the facts would be the basis of my position and would be the means I use to attempt to convince others of my position. In addition, I do not think it will be possible to achieve a ‘perfect’ outcome with complete consensus with everyone. Therefore, compromise will be essential to how I approach challenges and situations and ultimately a fair result. My own family composition attests to an ability to compromise and thrive with difference. My husband is Ethiopian and we have different religious, cultural, ethnic and historic experiences, yet we have been happily married for over five years with a beautiful son. Beyond the belief that fair redistricting will also help to rebuild trust within communities and lessen the toxic partisanship of our nation, I feel that my background in academia and research will help me be fair and impartial.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I believe that by having a master’s I have demonstrated a commitment and ability to apply logic and reason to a problem. While I worked at the Ethiopian Institute of Architecture, Building Construction and City Development, I received the highest student feedback of any academic staff of which there were over 200, which testified to my commitment to my position, which was fundamentally about teaching students how to apply logic and reason to their own work. In Melbourne, I worked as a consultant for the City of Melbourne doing community engagement. Through this work, I learned that people are generally rather reasonable with their beliefs and issues. However, it takes listening with an open heart to understand their issues. This experience gave me direct experience with community engagement and consensus building. My background in landscape architecture will be directly relevant to this position. I use GIS and CAD and have made many maps within my professional life at different scales. I have analyzed and generated large watershed-scale areas as well as microclimates on a smaller scale. I have generated maps based on several specific parameters and then generated other maps with different, but similar, parameters and compared them. This experience has given me intimate exposure on how maps can be manipulated and the importance human generated lines can hold. Inherent to a landscape architecture education and the profession is the overlap it has with city planning. Therefore, I think this will also contribute to my ability to understand population dynamics. I have published several academic works, such as a conference paper and two book chapters. Such publications were all written in connection with various universities spanning three continents. In addition, in my personal life I enjoy continued learning.
