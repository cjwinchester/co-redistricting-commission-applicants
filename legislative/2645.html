<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
The advocacy I have done for my church body is advocacy for social justice, like anti-poverty, healthcare, affordable housing, racial justice, equality and environmental issues, NOT lobbying for the special interests of the church. The same is true for AAUW, a voluntary organization, with a mission of advancing equity for women and girls through advocacy, education, and research.  In both situations, I work with others within the organization, as well as other organizations to determine to determine the specific legislative priority agenda and ballot issue positions.  In AAUW, I take the lead. Organizations we work with include League of Women Voters, FAMLII Coalition, Colorado Coalition for Reproductive Health, Rights and Justice.

Neither organization endorses partisan candidates or political parties.

Dating back to the 1980&#39;s, I have held a variety of leadership positions in my church body on the churchwide (national) and synodical (a 5 state geographic grouping) levels and in my congregations - Lutheran Church of the Resurrection in Lakewood, that closed 5 years ago, and now at Augustana.
 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Over my lifetime I have supported, both with time and money, candidates in both parties.  Prior to 1995 I was a registered Republican when I changed my party affiliation to Democrat. Since my own first campaign for the Colorado House in 1998 (then District 26) I have concentrated on my own races but also contributed financially to various Democrat colleagues.  This pattern continued through my last campaign for the Colorado Senate (then District 21) and since being term-limited in 2012, to this day. I have spent countless hours walking door-to-door and hosting fund-raisers.
Since November 10, 2015 contributions include:
National: Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden. U.S. Senate: Michael Bennet, Alice Madden, Andrew Romanoff, John Hickenlooper. Congress: Ed Perlmutter, Diana DeGette, Joe Neguse,Diane Matsch-Bush, Karen McCormick, Andrew Romanoff, Jason Crow.
State: Jared Polis, Jena Griswold, Dave Young, Phil Weiser, Norbert Chavez, Karla Esser
Democratic Senate Majority Project , Andy Kerr, Cheri Jahn, Jessie Danielson, Brittany Pedersen, Tammy Story, Rhonda Fields, Nancy Todd, Faith Winter, Rachel Zenzinger
Democratic House Majority Project, Chris Kennedy, Lisa Cutter, Monica Duran, Meg Froelich, Tracy Kraft-Tharp, Briana Titone, Mary Young, Leslie Daugherty, Iman Jodeh, David Aarestad
County: Lesley Dahlkemper, Casey Tighe, Andy Kerr, Tracy Kraft-Tharp, Jake Lily, Alexis King
Jeffco School Board Candidates and Lakewood Mayor Adam Paul
Issue Campaigns: Against personhood, abortion restrictions and bans.  For paid family and medical leave
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America(current congregation Augustana Lutheran Church in Denver); Lutheran Advocacy Ministry in Colorado (paid director 1990-1998, now a participant); Colorado Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice (former board chair), Interfaith Alliance of Colorado
Colorado Social Legislation Committee
American Association of University Women - Lakewood Branch member since 1976 and former President; State Public Policy Committee (former director, now lobby corps coordinator)
Jeffco Dems, Planned Parenthood of the Rockies, COBALT (formerly NARAL Colorado)
In the past: Citizens for Lakewood&#39;s Future, Leadership Lakewood alumni
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My experience of serving in the legislature has given me a good understanding of the differing needs of the different geographical parts of the state (Eastern Plains v Western Slope), rural and urban differences, as well as the need for ethnic and racial diversity and inclusion of a variety of special needs of people and communities.  It is important to take all of that into consideration, as well as fair representation of different political parties.  It is important to value all of those differences and also honor that we are ONE state.

I have participated in discussions with &quot;Build a Better Colorado&quot; working to reach the best consensus on statewide issues.  In an attempt to better understand my own community, I have participated in Leadership Lakewood, Lakewood Citizen Police Academy and Lakewood Citizen Planning Academy
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Fair maps are critical so that the various diverse communities can be heard and represented in our government at all levels.  During my tenure as a state legislator, I had the reputation of reaching across the aisle and working collaboratively with my colleagues in both parties.  As an example, on what I consider to be one of the most important Senate bills I passed, creating the Colorado Health Benefit Exchange, my House sponsor was a member of the other party.  We worked collaboratively along with the governor&#39;s office to create the first bipartisan Exchange in the country.  In the end, neither of us got the exact the bill we hoped for, but we created something that is still working today.
