</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My husband Steve and I have contributed occasionally to campaigns and political organizations on the Democrat side. The total for 2019-20 I would estimate to have been around $2,000: $500 to John Hickenlooper’s campaign, $300-500 to ActBlue, and the remainder in small amounts to various candidates in Colorado, Georgia, Michigan and Kentucky. Insignificant amounts in years 2015-18. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
For the 2015 Colorado Democratic State Convention I represented Precinct 631.  
Lions Clubs International is a humanitarian organization with members guided by kindness to serve our communities and the world in times of need.  Probably my biggest commitment of time to a community has been through the Denver Lions Club. I was its President in 2018-19 (first Latina ever). Under my leadership, I’ve taken volunteers to Ecuador, Ethiopia, Mexico, Mongolia, Nepal and Senegal on eyesight screening campaigns, within which we performed some eye surgeries and distributed hundreds - sometimes thousands - of recycled eyeglasses to needy citizens of these countries. 
I am a current Board member of Aurora Community Connection, whose mission is to increase access to resources and promote social equity for low-income, Spanish-speaking families in North Aurora. 
Ecuadorians in Colorado is a young organization made up of Ecuadorian residents in Colorado and their spouses. It is committed to help bridge the gap between the cultures of Ecuador &amp; Colorado so that nationals can succeed in their adoptive country. I am a Board member.
I worked with the General Consul of Ecuador in Phoenix, Arizona, to represent its office during the COVID -19 pandemic, here in Colorado. More than 150 Ecuadorian citizens (J1, F1, H2B, B1 visas holders) were stranded in Colorado when Ecuador closed its borders in April.
I was a member of the Mongolian Taskforce, asked by the Honorary Consul of Mongolia to join as a volunteer to help Mongolian nationals strained in Colorado due to COVID-19.

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
From 2012 to present, I’ve been in charge of developing, organizing, and leading any eyesight screenings campaigns conducted by our Lions Club locally and internationally. During my reign as Lions President, I instituted the concept of “Visible Tuesdays” on the 16th Street Mall in Denver to make downtown workers and visitors more aware of what Lions do.
During my pro bono work represent the General Consul of Ecuador in Colorado during the COVID-19 pandemic, I was focused on helping and advocating for Ecuadorians stranded in Colorado where 130 (J1, F1) exchange students and another 30 citizens (B1) and seasonal workers (H2B) lost their jobs, housing, and economic resources.  It was my duty to consider the interests of the population of Colorado. I persuaded the Denver Lions Foundation and the Ecuadorian community here in Colorado to donate money to purchase food for these displaced Ecuadorians.  Because the lockdown went beyond our expectations, I held meetings with their employers and sponsors to ask for their support. I was able to pin down financial aid, housing and food for these students.  
Later, I requested the help of the government, the IRS, individuals and local non-profit organizations to help me find the way to return the economic stimulus given by the US Treasury to those individuals who paid their 2018-2020 taxes.  I learned when I became a US citizen that an immigrant can’t receive financial aid from the US Government.  Thus, I told them not to dispose or cash these checks.  Finally, when the IRS had identified their mistake, I held trainings on how to send that money back.   

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Since I moved to the US, I have been fascinated with how a true democracy works.  My curiosity leads me to be willing to learn how districting is done. I believe I can help enormously because I am fluently bi-lingual and have developed an extensive awareness of the need to get the US and Latino cultures in sync for the betterment of the community.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I’m empathetic and can both understand and appreciate the needs of others, and I’m good with people, i.e., I can identify instances and causes of conflict and devise ways to work around them when needed. I’m pragmatic. I understand the differences between Latino and US culture, largely through my experiences as an exchange student in Tennessee in 1979-80 and my life here as a resident of Colorado and a citizen of the USA since 2000, and through my work at various projects since then, including developing programs for refugees and immigrants at Spring Institute for Intercultural Learning, and working together with The Colorado Trust in Denver to develop and lead Study Abroad Programs in North, Central and South America for Metropolitan State University of Denver. Later, as a teacher of Spanish at The Ohio State University and then as a bilingual recruiter at Community College of Denver, I found it meaningful to promote higher education among those students who otherwise would not have gone to College. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I’ve developed analytical skills in various ways: through my college education in Ecuador, by becoming an adult English learner in Colorado, by being a mother and at the same time working three jobs while attending school. My skills helped me become the valedictorian of my graduating class at Metropolitan State University of Denver in 2007 and to be granted a scholarship to continue my education at The Ohio State University. I’ve got excellent analytical skills and can apply logic to solve procedural and systemic problems but I ALSO have great inferential and intuitive skills, because of my unique background as an immigrant to the US from Ecuador and my proven ability over the years at work, as a mother of a family of four and as a soulmate to my husband Steve, whom I met through Lions and connected with more closely shortly after he was widowed in 2011.  I believe I have the wherewithal to solve problems using reason and logic and just plain common sense.
