<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I served as a Fraser Town Trustee 1995-1998. I have been active in local GOTV activities starting in 2004. Most recently in 2016 and 2018. I was the Vice Chair of the Grand County Dems 2015 thru the 2017 reorg. I have testified twice (as a citizen) in the CO House in favor of legislation regarding renewable energy standards.  A list donations to the best of my knowledge is attached.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I serve on the Board of Mountain Parks Electric Inc. as a Director. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I worked as the Community Energy Coordinator for Grand and Jackson Counties through a Governors Energy Office program- the program helped rural communities tap into opportunities for training, grants etc related to energy conservation and renewables. Multiple local stakeholders including representatives from towns, counties, and key businesses participated in this process.  I have volunteered as a tutor at the East Grand High School working with ESL students.  The extra time and care helped the students make progress that was tangible. It gave me a small window into the lives of the students; their dreams and their realities.  In collaboration with local faith organizations I helped organize Know Your Rights training sessions for local immigrants. I have provided underserved residents with transportation to critical health care services which helped me understand their challenges accessing health care and the hurdles that those living in rural communities face when they need advanced care not available in their local community. I served on the boards of the Headwaters Trail Alliance and the Colorado Headwaters Land Trust in the very early days of their formation. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Districting is one of the foundational pillars of our democracy. Fair maps are critical to the legitimacy of our elected officials and will lead to a healthier democracy. I feel that service on the Redistricting Commission is a unique opportunity to contribute to Colorado governance at a foundational level and that it is my civic duty.  In college it was discussed that those with the most at stake are most likely to participate and dominate democracies due to the opportunity costs for the average citizen. Yet I still like to think that the average citizen can shape our democracy into a system that serves the people.   My experience as an MPEI Director and as a Community Energy Coordinator has given me insight into the many different perspectives of the folks living in Grand and Jackson counties. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
For eight years (1998-2006) I served as the Technical Coach to mogul skiers on the US Ski Team. As a group of three coaches we had one goal: To be the best mogul team in the world. Yet mogul skiing is not a team sport, it is an individual sport, with individual athletes competing for spots on the U.S  Team, starts in World Cups, starts in World Championships and the Olympics as well as sponsorships and financial support. It took the whole team (men and women) working together; coaches, athletes, physios and sports psych to provide a platform from which individual athletes could succeed and the team could be the best in the world.  The U.S Team was the only path for American mogul skiers to get to the Olympics, it wasn&#39;t like they could transfer to another team if things didn&#39;t work out. Selection criteria needed to be applied consistently and athletes treated fairly for the whole project to succeed and for athletes to realize their potential. There was tremendous competition amongst the athletes but it was tempered by friendships built, mutual understanding and pride of being part of a successful team. I see the Redistricting Commissions as having many of the same dynamics.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I hope that I can bring the same type of skills prioritizing issues to be addressed, brainstorming how issues can be approached and strategic planning that helped guide the US Mogul Team. Ultimately this is about developing a process and final product that will serve Coloradans in a fair and equitable manner and that residents believe is collaborative and legitimate.
As a coach developing data analytics coupled with emerging video technology helped inform decision making and was a key to our success. But understanding what we needed to know had to happen first. 

More recently, the Board of Mountain Parks Electric has just completed strategic planning. As a Director I am familiar with budgeting and continually try to improve my listening and consensus building skills. During my time as a Director at Mountain Parks we have reviewed energy usage data,  patterns and forecasts. This has led to a near constant conversation of cost drivers whether it be demand charges, weather or geographic distribution and an examination of what can be controlled. Keeping these costs in mind,  rate structure and setting is all about costs being equitably born by consumer members.  We also have continuing conversation on what information we need to serve our members better.
