        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Robert F. Matthias</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Robert F. Matthias
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Robert Frederic Matthias</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I retired two years ago.  The previous 25 years I worked as a full-time, professional handyman.  Previous to that, I served as a geologist up to divisional VP in the corporate world for companies large and small.  I had P&amp;L responsibility for a $6MM division of a privately held firm.  More recently, I&#39;ve served two large churches as volunteer Chair of the Board of Management for a total of 11 years, responsible for the finances and physical plants of both, with budgets of $1.3MM and endowments of $6MM.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  BA and MS in Geology.  MBA with finance as emphasis.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80303
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have canvassed for Obama and H. Clinton, and made phone calls for the Democrats in Florida and Boulder in the most recent election.  I have contributed small amounts to numerous Democratic candidates, all over the country, too numerous to list.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I served as Chair of the Board of Management and member of Church Council of First Congregational Church of Boulder, CO for five years until 2019.  My board had responsibility for a $900,000 annual budget and $4MM endowment.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As Board Chair at First Cong, I developed subcommittees to spread the work load and responsibility for various aspects of our work, and to increase board members&#39; involvement.  I also served on the church&#39;s Stewardship Committee, helping to raise the funds to make the church operate.  Earlier, I served as Hiking School Director for the Boulder Group of the Colorado Mountain Club, organizing classroom and field training.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I&#39;ve lived in Colorado 22 years, and would like to give something back to my adopted state.  In this hyper-partisan time, I believe I can bring a voice of reason and fairness to the political process.  I have no interest in elective office, so this would be a way for me to do that.  I have the time available for this big commitment.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
One of the hallmarks of a democracy is valuing the minority interests.  Being in the majority does not make one more &quot;right&quot; or give one the ability to ignore the legitimate concerns of others.  I listen to others&#39; opinions and have empathy with them.  I believe I can be impartial because I know my political party is not right all of the time and does not have exclusive access to the truth.  I have served on juries in two criminal cases, and while not the foreman, I played a key role in achieving a verdict.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I was trained as a scientist (geologist) and moved into senior management with various employers.  I rarely worked for someone who knew more about how to do my job than I did; I usually had to figure it out myself, using logic and reason.  In my last 25 years as a handyman I spent my time figuring out what the problem was before I could devise a solution.  I have long practice using logic and reason.
