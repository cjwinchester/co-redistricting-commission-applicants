</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
For the past eight years, I served on the board for Child Advocates-Denver CASA. This organization recruits and trains community volunteers to advocate for the best interests of children who have experienced abuse or neglect in the Denver Court System. 
As an employee with the Colorado Department of Education, I served as a representative on a variety of statewide review teams including Colorado Teacher of the Year, Milken Educator Award, State Induction Review Team, Retaining Teachers Grant Review Team, and Unified Improvement Plan Review Team providing feedback and recommendations for the applicants.
At Denver Public Schools and the Colorado Charter School institute, I participated on unit review teams, and made recommendations to proposals including charter school authorization, renewal, and school closure. 
I have served on multiple committees advocating for first generation college students, female staff, and staff of color at the University of Denver.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am fascinated with how the process of how policy is introduced by legislators, written, and how it ultimately gets translated on the ground for practitioners and the public. In all of my work roles, I look for ways to serve as a pivot point between the policy created at the legislative level and how to make it meaningful, relevant, and maximize the intent of the law with those on the ground. 
Serving on this commission would allow me to participate in the future of Colorado, the first state I have truly called home. Seeing the impact of how the current district lines have been drawn, as well as having traveled to and worked directly with school leadership in cities and towns across the state, I believe I can provide a unique voice as we determine our new district lines based on census information. I am very well-acquainted with Colorado&#39;s desire to maintain local control and would strive to promote this sentiment throughout the process.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Building relationships has always been the core of my professional positions and I often interact with a variety of constituents daily, including staff of all levels, superintendents, district and school leaders, faculty, students, parents, and community organizations. With this large cross-section of people, I have been responsible for communicating often complex federal and state policies. One of my favorite roles is to work with this diverse cross-section of stakeholders on a daily basis allowing me to better understand local issues and the desired autonomy as they work to implement policy changes in a meaningful way for their communities. My background in conflict resolution has given me tools to promote consensus and my background interpreting policy, which may not always be popular, reinforces my ability to be fair or impartial.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I received my bachelor&#39;s degree in biology, and analytical skills are at the base of the scientific method. These skills allow me to evaluate problems from simple to complex and incorporate some of my strongest attributes including researching skills, attention to detail, critical thinking ability, and decision-making as I examine a problem and reach a solution. These same skills are applied to policy interpretation and implementation.
