        <h1>Application for Legislative Commission for Michael Roger Jenet</h1>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Michael Roger Jenet
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Michel Roger Jenet</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Self Employed, CEO of Non-Profit &quot;The Journey Institute&quot;
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Eight year United States Air Force Veteran, former CEO, CTO, and Executive Level Manager from an education of a High School Degree.  Building upon my education in the USAF I approached each position I held in my career by taking specific courses of study related to those jobs.  Rather than relying on a broad course of collegiate study, I targeted my courses to subject matter that directly applied to each position I held throughout my career.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80022
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I initially ran as Chair for the Adams County Veteran&#39;s Advisory Committee precisely because I wanted to make sure everyone&#39;s voice was heard.  As a brand new committee, our first meeting had a few loud voices and quite a few who were quiet or silent but had important things to say.
As chair, I wanted to put structure in place that would ensure everyone&#39;s voice is heard.
I believe it is that very desire and execution of said structure that has resulted in the commission members asking me to stay on as Chair for another two years.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My wife has been a state Representative since 2016.  I have donated money to her campaign.  I understand the importance of fair and balanced districting to avoid gerrymandering from either party because of my understanding of her public service.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I currently serve as the inaugural Chair of the Adams County Veterans Advisory Committee since 2018 and have been re-elected to that position this month for another two years. My wife and I volunteer to curate TEDx events and have curated 4 TEDxWomen events, 1 TEDxMSUDenver, and 1 TEDxCountdown (climate change) since 2015. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that the intent of districting (redistricting), of drawing electoral district boundaries that are equitable, non-advantageous, and non-discriminatory; have failed over the years, resulting in targeted and specific gerrymandering, despite the Voting Rights Act.
I hope to be part of a commission that will work to change this long held pattern of behavior and put districts back into alignment where every voters vote matters.  There should not be an advantage one way or the other determined by which party has control at a given re-districting year.  The districts should be drawn based on population and an equitable division between parties within a district.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe the structure of the commission, and the person(s) who lead it will go a long way to determine the success of the commission.  Everyone should have an equal voice on the commission.  Everyone should feel safe to voice their opinion without fear of retribution, ridicule, or judgement.  The commission should be made up of like minded individuals who have the ultimate goal of making the best decisions possible when it comes to drawing districts.  Working together towards this goal should be the aim of everyone who wants to join.
Ensuring that all voices are heard at the table, that all points of view are considered, laying down a framework that allows for that would be the first thing I would advocate for.
I served in the military for 8 years and was a registered Republican.  I am married to a Democrat in public service.  I see pros and cons to both parties, which is why I am unaffiliated.  I don&#39;t believe either party is &#39;evil&#39;, nor do I believe either party has all the answers.  I believe when it comes to redistricting, however, we need to work for the people, not the politicians.  This process should be about fairness to the people of Colorado.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In a prior life, before becoming an executive, I spent 20+ in Information Technology, culminating as a Chief Technology Officer. Logic, analysis, and problem solving have always been my strong suits.  As a leader, I believe in putting the best people in positions to excel and that my job is merely to help them succeed.  On a commission the same rule applies.  Hopefully the best people are chosen, the leaders and members of the commission have the role of making sure everyone succeeds in their roles.
