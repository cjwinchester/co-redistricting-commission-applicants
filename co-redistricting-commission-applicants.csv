In my view, both Democratic and Republican parties have become too self-serving in a way that seeks to concentrate and solidify political power instead of representing their citizens' membership with an intent to govern responsibly.  One of the approaches that the parties have taken is to seek to gerrymander various systems to favor their party interests at the expense of individual citizens.  Colorado voters recognize this tendency and are seeking to re-balance the fairness of elections via this redistricting effort.","As a professional project and program manager responsible for the Rocky Mountain Region of the USFS' environmental cleanup program, my work in creating and managing partnerships and managing relationships with local, state and federal agencies to clean up abandoned mines and preplan and coordinate for hazardous materials release emergencies is ongoing.  In the interagency Regional Response Team, I represent the USFS and US Department of Agriculture.  Under my guidance, the USFS continues to partner with various State (CDPHE, CDRMS, CGS & others), federal (US EPA, US DOE, US DoJ, DOI (including BLM and NPS) to address remediation of abandoned hardrock mines throughout Colorado.  At home, both as a BM HOA board member and citizen of the Bear Mountain neighborhood, I shared my 20+ years of experience as a volunteer firefighter, red-carded wildland firefighter and emergency response manager at both federal and local levels to advocate for FIREWISE implementation in  our neighborhood.  This included collaboration with neighbors, local fire department, and Jefferson County staff to include a strong focus on mitigating ingress/egress routes for one-way-in neighborhoods, as well as establishing emergency access easements across private property for both ingress/egress and ""safe zones"" to be used during fires.  In the past, I've also served as chief steward of a (non-partisan) federal employee union (SFGE - American Federation of Government Employees), representing federal employees at the Rocky Flats site to the Department of Energy - in both union and employee negotiations.","PMP certification (Project Management Professional, expired); AARP; NARFE (National Assoc. or active and retired federal employees); BMHOA (Bear Mountain Home Owners Assoc. board member); AAA Colorado; Rocky Mountain Region Employees Association (USFS); Bear Mountain CWPIP (Community wildfire protection implementation plan) committee","In my day job cleaning up abandoned mine sites and improving surface water quality, I've designed and implemented environmental sampling plans.

Generally, this has meant voting based on a variety of beliefs, positions and issues rather than voting based on party ideology.

I would like to serve on the commission because I want to apply my problem-solving skills that I have refined throughout my career to public service.   I have enjoyed volunteering throughout my life, I have enjoyed taking on new challenges, and I also enjoyed collaborating with others to find solutions, and I view becoming a member of the commission as a natural extension.","When I was involved with the IEEE organization, I helped organize numerous events promoting the Electrical Engineering profession in this state and the industries that hire those professionals.  As an organization, we created networking events, presentations by guest speakers, round table discussions, and even flew to Washington, DC to help lobby for everything from improvements in energy policies to immigration – all areas that would directly or indirectly bring more clean technology jobs to Colorado.","My career  has kept me from being more involved than I desire, but I am happy to say that I was an active volunteer for 13 years for Stargate School in Thornton, CO until the spring of 2019 when my youngest son graduated from that school.

As a Stargate volunteer, I donated time to the school in a variety of capacities: I helped the school with its information technology systems, chaired their Website Committee, and most importantly, chaired their Election Committee where we organized, executed, and ratified two elections per year with over 1000 stakeholders whereby we elected board members, elected committee members, and adopted changes to the bylaws.  Volunteering for Stargate was extremely rewarding.

I am currently a member of Mosaic Lodge #184 AF&AM, in East Lake, CO, a member of the Denver Consistory, a Shriner (Shriners Children’s Hospitals), a member of the Advisory Committee of the Broomfield Chapter of DeMolay, and a former Section Chair of the Denver Section of IEEE (Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers).","My education has instilled in me a strong sense of logic and reason.  In addition, analysis, critical thinking, and ongoing education are critical skills that I continue to rely upon in my profession protecting data, keeping computers secure, defending against cyber threats, and staying one step ahead of hackers in our technology-driven word.

Throughout my career, I have been pragmatic professional where I have used my analytical skills to make the best decisions, even if the information available is not perfect.  In those cases where information is vague or contradicts itself (and that seems to happen frequently), I have used logic, reasoning, communication, collaboration, and courage to find the best solution possible.","The first and most important step promoting consensus among the commissioners is to never loose sight of the commission’s objectives and responsibilities.  

As the commission considers options for redistricting, the second step to promoting consensus is to ensure that the options for a new congressional district map are based on facts and data from the census and input from the public hearings.  

Armed with consensus on our responsibilities, equal access and understanding of the data, and education from the feedback from the public hearings; the committee will then be on a strong foundation for aligning on a congressional map that best servers Colorado.

I believe this approach will achieve consensus among the commissioners, makes the commissions’ work as fair and impartial as possible, and creates a map that is justified by facts, and not rhetoric or political whims.","I grew up in a politically active family in a small agricultural town in northern Montana.  During college, I received and political science internship with the Montana State Senate, where I supported the efforts of numerous republican senators.   That internship opened additional opportunities for me to participate in politics, include volunteering for a successful Gubernatorial campaign and being elected as an alternate delegate to the Republican National Convention in New Orleans, LA in 1988.

Now the citizens of the state have made concrete efforts to move the redistricting process out of politics and government (per se.)  I believe individuals such as myself should volunteer to take the experience, training, and leadership learned over years of making people and systems work correctly and put those skills to use making the redistricting work for the citizens, not the politicized governmental establishment.  All Colorado citizens deserve to have themselves and their neighbors properly represented in our fantastic democratic republic.  Colorado is diverse from many different perspectives - some rural some urban, some mountains - some plains, some agriculture - some energy, some business – some labor, etc.  The list goes on.  Each perspective deserves the ability to express its collective, and sometimes unique, needs, desires, & contributions, via both the federal and state representations.

Who wouldn’t want to be part of that?","In addition to the GOP County Central Committee above, I have been active in the non-profit Rocky Mountain Wing (RMW) Commemorative Air Force (CAF) serving on the Wing Staff as both Education Officer and as the Wing Newsletter Editor.  Accomplishments include implementing the CAF Rise Above program that has enabled 1,000's of Colorado Westen Slope middle school students to be exposed to and experience the dedication and determination put forth by our Greatest Generation during WWII.  I also successfully campaigned to have the Wing's Grumman TBM Avenger Torpedo Bomber certified as both a Colorado State Historical Object and a National Historic Object (airplane), one of only two that regularly continue to fly.  

Even though somewhat inactive over the past few months, over several years I have written for and maintained a small blog where I've posted many, many letters I've written to Congressmen, Senators, and state officials regarding issues current at the time.

I never considered flying these aircraft a ""profession"" but rather a diversion to hone both my mental skills as well as improve and maintain my piloting skills.  

Without question, piloting today's aircraft in ""the crowded skies"" requires logic and reasoning skills above the norm.  

Most piloting (with perhaps the exception of crop dusting)can be hours of boredom interspersed with moments of terror!  Those moments of terror require logic and reasoning skills way beyond those necessary to put together a contract for a worldwide computer packet switching network.  Operating within one environment compliments the other - I speak from experience in both cases.

Gathering known reliable and meaningful data, using demonstrated means to analyze the data for information pertinent to the problem at hand, applying the information in acceptable means, and then making sound decisions based on the data - not other outside emotionally charged input -  is the path to success - both in the cockpit and the boardroom.  That same logic and decision path will serve the redistricting commission, and Colorado's diverse citizenship very well.","I spent my entire professional career negotiating - establishing consensus between groups and individuals.

I want to be active in crafting solutions that benefit Colorado voters statewide. I consider myself a life-long learner, a good listener, a team worker and a fair person.","My experience in organizing, representing and advocating for groups is centered on education and literacy. As a veteran teacher I had experience with organizations such as Close Up, The Educational Testing Service, The Colorado Council for Economic Education, The Colorado Geographic Alliance (COGA), and teaching Advanced Placement U.S. History, World Geography, European History and World History. I have been a reader/scorer for the College Board for over fifteen years. I have served as a reader/evaluator for the Children’s Book Council, participating on committees for the Notable Social Studies Award and the Carter G. Woodson Award. For years I have served as a local judge for the National History Day competition.","Independent Voter, I was a member of the Denver Classroom Teachers Association prior to my retirement in 2016. A member of the Colorado Geographic Alliance and the American Library Association.","In achieving my Masters in Library and Information Science from the University of Denver in 2007 I had many opportunities to apply sophisticated analysis to situations and scenarios presented as part of my course work and in my subsequent employment as a librarian. 
From developing authentic collections and embracing the needs of diverse patrons to budget considerations within unique tax districts, the focus on analyzing data enabled me to chart a clear path for providing relevant and productive library service for all.

My ability to apply logic and reason to a problem is perhaps best illustrated by my work as a reader for the College Board’s Advanced Placement United States History exam. 
As a reader, our job is to read and score (according to a pre-set rubric) student’s essays answering one topic question during a seven day session that begins each day at 8am and ends at 5pm. The same question over and over, but answered by high school students from all over the country (as well as those attending international schools). We each read hundreds of essays daily by students whose skill sets vary wildly. 
Our goal as readers is to award the students for what they know – not punish them for what they omit or get wrong. Many times logic dictates that the student answered the prompt correctly, looking at their writing holistically, and even though there might be minor errors in their writing. Reason takes that logic by the hand and reminds us as readers that the student wrote the essay in 45 minutes, under extreme pressure and without prior knowledge of the prompt. 
So when we spend the two to three minutes reading and scoring each essay we embrace that reason and logic and our goal to benefit the student’s effort is realized.","I will promote consensus by being patient in listening to all points of view expressed and by maintaining flexibility in my own opinions. I believe my career as a public school teacher has helped shape my skills in this regard. High School students share their thoughts and opinions about absolutely everything. An integral part of being a good teacher is listening to what they have to say without verbal or visual signs of judgement, and then working towards an answer, resolution or consideration. 
This skill was, and is, often tested when what is said clashes with my own ideas or realities. That is where the work gets more difficult and can be more rewarding. 
Often in committee meetings, parent conferences, as well as mentoring new teachers, the same patience and honest listening is needed. 
Especially in these challenging times, I have no doubt that building agreement with any diverse group of people will be difficult. I believe with my personal history and experience I am up to the task.","My past political activity has mostly involved teaching my high school Social Studies students about local, state, national government, civic participation and the U.S. Constitution. When applicable, I have encourage my senior students to register to vote. In line with district policy, I have always presented a non-partisan view in my teaching as well as in my professional profile. 
As a registered Independent voter I have been fortunate and honest in regarding the issues behind ballot measures and candidates, as opposed to being influenced along party lines.

I like to compare it to solving word problems. I am a very logical thinker, which led to my successful career of 40 years in that industry. Most of my career was spent doing program development and fixing customer issues. Maintenance programming consists of using logic to listen to the customer problem and thinking about what may be causing it in the code. You need to be able to approach a problem in a logical manner, identify possible causes, and eliminate them until the correct issue is found and fixed. Logic and reason are what it's all about!

Among other things, this means that district lines are not written in such a way to ensure a particular outcome, but rather that citizens in each district are given real choice with candidates that attend to the needs and interests of the population.  Second, I am a strong believer in shared community responsibility.  While it is easy to criticize the decisions of others, we often forget how difficult it is to shoulder the decisions.  I offer my time and effort to share that responsibility.","I have concentrated my efforts on addressing environmental issues and community support.  These are issues I take a hands-on approach to through my volunteer activities and then focus on through my classes (regularly teaching an upper division course at CU Boulder focused on environmental policy, for example)","Boulder Rotary Club; American Red Cross (Boulder-Broomfield Chapter, Disaster Action Team); Institute for Environmental Solutions (steering committee for CO community projects, 2014-present); Global Greengrants (pro bono researcher, 2017-2019); Eco-Cycle (pro bono research associate, 2016-2017); Wild Foundation (pro bono project coordinator, 2015); Colorado Alliance for Environmental Educators; North American Association for Environmental Educators; Community Food Share (weekly volunteer in food distribution, 2015-2018)","I am well-steeped in a variety of analytical methods, from quantitative to qualitative analysis, and seek the best available data to build understanding.  Not all social phenomena are measurable or accepted as valid, and thus I am also very much attuned to how ideas are communicated, sometimes very intentionally designed to divide.  I have also paid attention to the details of redistricting (legal rules, political manuevering, technology aids in achieving politically-favored results, etc.).  While I cannot claim expertise in mapping, I am an analytical thinker and balanced thinker who can spot bias.","Being even-handed and building consensus are critical practices in my teaching and community service.  I seek to identify needs and shared interests in building towards agreement -- moving away from hard positions to language that fosters a commitment to supporting our common ground.  I have long used the negotiation principles and practices developed in the book ""Getting to Yes.""  
In terms of my ability to be fair or impartial, these are practices critical in any effective community activity or in the teaching environment, and most particularly in the contemporary political science class. I communicate to students at the outset that we should expect disagreement and this is partly due to our different sets of life experiences.  Furthermore, none of us has a lock on ""the truth,"" and instead it is the collective set of perspectives that will help us to identify our common reality and get us closer to ""the truth.""  This is akin to the traditional Indian parable, ""the blind men and the elephant.""  With this at the foundation, I am committed to not only giving fair and equal voice to competing perspectives, but also asking individuals to ""step into the shoes of the other"" as we consider why we might disagree.  I favor coming to the middle rather than than win-lose outcomes.","As an academic focused on American politics, I am an avid observer of politics, including of redistricting politics.  I regularly teach undergraduates on issues of American politics, including on the US Congress, and oversee students engaged in political and campaign-related internships (for all political parties and a wide range of candidates at local, state and national levels).

Our HOA covenants was set up unfairly such that more than 1/2 of the community was paying more for HOA fees than others and the disparity was growing every time HOA fees were raised because of a covenant rule that a portion of the neighborhood should pay 1.5 times more than the other portion. The HOA fees are used for maintenance of amenities in the community to which all households have equal access.  I lead the committee to research (with the help of a couple of board members) how we could change the covenants and educate the community on how the HOA fees were used for assets to which everyone has equal access. We learned that we would have to have an election to add an amendment to remove the 1.5 times rule. 

I sent out polls for the community to vote on preferred methods of equalizing the fees. Although this seemed like an insurmountable task the poll indicated that 18 or 19 of the homeowners who were paying less would vote for the change to the covenants.  This was a sign that the task was not insurmountable and we proceeded with community meetings and presentations which I put together. Myself and the two board members presented the information. We held an election and my team and I canvassed the neighborhood to make sure everyone voted.

I received my Master's in College Student Personnel Administration from Colorado State University in 1976. I received my PhD in College Student Personnel Administration from the University of Northern Colorado in 1987.,"In 1969 I entered Colorado State University (CSU) as a Political Science major. My interest in the democratic process was strong then and has continued to grow. After working at CSU for 44 years and nearing retirement in May 2021 I have maintained my strong interest in volunteer public service and citizen participation in the political process. The Colorado Independent Redistricting Commission offers an excellent opportunity to serve the state of Colorado.

The commission provides a solution to promote fair redistricting. I have a strong belief that the process of redistricting should be guided by transparency and public input. Additionally, I believe that maps should fairly reflect the will of the voters and that the redistricting commission can improve outcomes and satisfaction across all stakeholders. Protecting the voting rights of persons-of-color, and balancing the preservation of communities of interest with the preservation of county and municipal boundaries is vitally important.

Serving on the commission requires the ability to be fair and impartial. For the past 30 years at CSU, I have served as an Equal Opportunity Representative on university search committees, a responsibility that has fairness and impartiality at its core. Additionally, my doctoral dissertation was on ethical decision-making. I taught an Ethics course at the graduate level for over ten years, conducted ethics workshops for the university and community, and presented on ethical decision making at conferences nationally and internationally. The quest for fairness has been a lifetime endeavor.

At CSU, I have served on a joint-appointment as both an administrator and faculty member for 37 years. In my faculty role I served as Program Chair for a Master’s program with over 30 faculty which required the ability to promote consensus and agreement on a daily basis. I was able to develop a collegial environment and build consensus on curricular development, course content, and student issues.  Effectively promoting agreement involved listening, collaboration, and clear communication.

For the past 12 years I have served at the Executive Director of Assessment and Research at CSU. A position that requires analytical skills and the ability to apply logic. The position involves analyzing numerous quantitative and qualitative research and assessment projects, evaluating programs and services, and guiding departments through their five-year program reviews. I have been very successful in using the data to help the institution increase its effectiveness and improve its programs. I also served at the Director of Research on the board of directors of the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators (NASPA), and chaired the Committee on Commissioned Research for the Association of College and University Housing Officers – International (ACUHO-I). In addition to analytical skills and the application of logic, the coin of the realm in all of these positions is trust and credibility.

I am currently working half-time and will be fully retiring from CSU at the end of May, 2021. I make the best of every day and look forward to contributing considerable time to the commission.

All my best,

If you can address easy problems first, you will be able to build upon that data model to address harder problems later on while also making critical improvement along the way.

I am an adherent of the teaching of behavioral economics, and try to understand how to overcome the inherent shortcuts in thinking to overcome bias and ensure the decisions I make are well reasoned and based upon sound processes, even if the outcomes are not always perfect.","My professional background is change management, and I have spent my career working to bring people along difficult changes in their workplaces. This has equipped me with skills and experience working with people who are extremely resistant and highly motivated to work against the changes. But I have been successful in building coalitions of support to bring them into the fold. My strongest leadership traits are empathy, relationship building and understanding context. It is these three strengths that I think would be most important to building consensus and agreement on the commission. Building trust and strong relationships among the other commissioners will help ensure that the commission moves forward with a unified vision for Colorado. 
I do believe my relative inactivity in the public political sphere in Colorado to date is a benefit in this area as I do not bring potential baggage of previous negative interactions with other commissioners from having worked on opposing sides of other issues. This, along with my historic ability to quickly build and foster friendly working relationships with others based upon empathy and understanding lead me to believe I would be able to help build consensus on the commission. In regard to being fair and impartial, I certainly hold my own beliefs and political views, but I try to challenge those regularly to ensure they are still the views I believe in. But ultimately, being a commissioner is not about my views and what I want politically, it is about representing the people of Colorado in the fairest way and ensuring each citizen not on the commission is equally and fairly represented as we review and propose redrawn districts throughout the state.

I've gotten quite good at validating others, listening to their point of view, listening for what they don't say as well as what they do say. I have a few personal rules. 1. Listen to others and validate what they say. Even if you ultimately disagree, they will feel like they've been heard. 2. When things go wrong, apologize if someone needs to hear it, even if you feel like you didn't do anything wrong. It shows a willingness to accept responsibility, and calms others down. 3. Stay civil.

I also completed the welding program at Pickens Technical School in Aurora, CO a long time ago (I was certified but it has lapsed).  I also maintain a CDL with tanker endorsement.","Quite simply, I want two things:  
1. I want rural Colorado to have more of a voice in Colorado politics and decision making.  I believe a thoughtful redistricting will help this.
2. I will be perfectly honest and say that I want to influence the districting.  I have no interest in political office, but I have been concerned at the direction things have taken of late and want to have a hand in shaping the future direction the state goes in.","My experience thus far has been mainly in contacting elected officials, unelected officials, and the media concerning issues that are of importance to me.  My main focus thus far has been in advocating for privacy rights and transparency in using cell phone data to track citizens' movements, advocating for having the (once the initial emergency has been cleared) Colorado Assembly decide how to respond to pandemics rather than one man in the Governor's chair, and advocating for the rural parts of the state to have more of a voice in Colorado government.  I contact people via phone, via email, and have begun using social media as a way to contact officials and to reach directly through to people using my Facebook group Colorado Accountability Project.  I am also trying to encourage others to get involved by contacting their elected officials.","Outside of being a registered Libertarian since I first started voting, I am not a member of any political organizations.  I am not a member of any civic organizations or community organizations either.  Outside of commitments at my work (which wold be mostly internal committees like the Human Resources Leadership Committee) I am not a member of any other associations","I am not sure how to take the word “analytical” in your question; i.e. I am not sure if you mean analytical in terms of the ability to understand and parse an argument or position, or whether you mean analytical in the mathematical/statistical sense.  In either case I feel that I am well suited in this regard.  I did not take the road into academia, but most of my education has been along that line and I regularly work on learning new things in physics (which requires the ability to understand and break down mathematical/logical arguments and the ability to apply math to them).  I will be honest and tell you that my knowledge of some higher level statistics concepts is incomplete, but I learn quickly and don’t anticipate a problem.
As regards the second part of your question, I do not feel as though I will have an issue applying logic and reasoning to a problem.  When you go to solve a problem in physics or mathematics (especially once you are beyond the level of memorizing a formula and into the areas of novel study) that’s exactly what you do.  Interestingly, it’s also what you do when trying to fix something (I’m working on restoring a track loader and help my dad in his semi restorations) though perhaps with less or a different form of math.  I feel as though I am well practiced in this regard.","I am glad I’m coming upon this question a few years after I got married, because I believe being married has greatly shifted (for the better) my perspective on reaching consensus among two people who have strongly-held, opposite opinions.  If you’re also married, I’m sure you understand as well.  My experience thus far has taught me that promoting consensus or agreement starts by recognizing that people of good will can disagree, and that someone else not seeing things the way I do doesn't make them ignorant or careless or etc.   Starting from that point, I think consensus building or compromise takes the form of outlining why you feel the way you do, what your goals are, outlining what you can't live with, and then finding areas of agreement.  For the things that you cannot agree on, you return to what you can't live with, and start saying what you'll tolerate.  I think keeping in mind that the essence of good compromise means that you (and all other parties) will be a little unhappy helps too.  It keeps you focused on what a reasonable outcome will look like.
I would like to say that I’m perfect in regard to being impartial, but I cannot.  Being fair to others, however, is a big value of mine.  In my experience as a teacher, I have had numerous times where I’ve had a student that I didn’t like, or one that sent a nasty email to my boss, or some such.  I have then had the chance to catch that student in a “gotcha” situation—a situation where they’d broken some minor rule or forgotten a homework or some such.  I cannot tell you how good it would have felt to bring the hammer down, but if I allow everyone else one free mistake, I must allow the troublesome students the same grace--difficult as it is.  That’s plain fairness.  It’s how I would want to be treated.  As another example, you may have been able to read between the lines thus far and know that I disagree vehemently with many things that Gov Polis and others have done.  Perhaps not, but let me know make it explicitly clear.  I disagree vehemently with many of the policy decisions and actions that Polis and others have undertaken.  In my Facebook group posts (Colorado Accountability Project—you’re welcome to go see), I do my best in posting to not step outside the truth and to be fair.  For example, in a recent post (recent as I write this on 8/13), I wrote some notes on Polis taking grant money to fund some of his political priorities.  The very first thing I wrote is that it’s not illegal and he has not been the first governor to do so","This one will be brief.  My political activity is mostly recent.  I have, of course, voted in every election since I was eligible and try to do my due diligence on informing myself of the initiatives and etc. on the ballot, but it wasn't until recently (actually it was Gov Polis emergency declaration and state shutdown that spurred it) that I became more actively involved.  I have not ever, and do not plan to ever, donate money to any campaign, candidate, or political organization.  I have, however, spent a great deal of time emailing and talking to both elected and unelected people in the areas of interest to me in an effort to influence and change what I have seen happening lately in Colorado.  I have also (because the response rate from officials and the media can be dishearteningly small) begun to create groups and use social media to expand my reach and to go directly to people.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/77

Problems can arise from all sorts of angles and it’s my job to anticipate and mitigate those potential issues. In my brewing career, problems were often more acute and required immediate, effective action to resolve. There is little time to deliberate when an enormous tank is leaking, and so I developed a quick response time to problems that does not compromise the effectiveness of the solution. In my academic training, I built a foundation of logical and reasoned analysis since the field of chemistry tolerates no other type of analysis. In my leisure time, I’m always eager to learn a new board game or puzzle because they help me think about strategic problem solving in a new light. Tasks like the Commission’s are a good fit for me.","I have found success throughout my personal and professional life in guiding meetings and conversations to a place that promotes consensus. I once managed a 30-person team of graduate student volunteers, which is a fragile coalition to hold together since students always have competing interests for their time and, being volunteers, I could offer them no material incentives. I was ultimately able to keep the group engaged, and on this and other teams I have relied upon a few key building blocks to set the stage for productive collaboration.


Confirm goals and check assumptions: Do we have a common understanding of our purpose? Are there facts we all recognize? Many disagreements can be forestalled by establishing a baseline of goals and information that the entire group accepts.


Match outcomes to goals: What does success look like? Does this hypothetical result comport with our mission? Why or why not? Holding up possible outcomes for consideration helps ground the group in the reality of their decisions.


Connect actions to outcomes: If we take this step, will it lead to the result we want? The result that we agree will help achieve our goals? Actions can be more easily agreed upon if their connections to prior points of consensus are made clear; it is also important to deliberately give proposed actions a reality check for unintended consequences.


Half the battle (at least) of gathering consensus from a diverse group lies in simply avoiding derailment, since tangents constantly threaten to intrude and have a tendency to build their own momentum once instigated. Furthermore, it is crucial to follow good evidence wherever it leads and to be an active listener who strives to hear the truth in the experiences of one’s peers. These steps, attitude, and adherence to evidence are crucial ingredients for impartiality and consensus-building, and I believe a good process leads to good outcomes. While a harmonious ending is never guaranteed, these factors maintain a focus on the right questions and lead to the right conversations. I will strive to foster this collaborative process on the Commission.","Small amounts (<$150) to:

The intersection of democracy and ethics is the notion of equity for all citizens; viz. that every person has equal say and power to shape the nature of the political bodies which affect his/her live.

The way that voting districts are set up is, obviously, the foundation of whether any particular system is equitable or not.  Redistricting has been used for partisan purposes—by all political parties—from well before Governor Gerry ‘gerrymandered’ the Massachusetts districts in 1812 up to today.  This has been the source of a considerable lack of fairness in our political system.  I would be honored and excited to be able to participate in this important work.

I am proud of Colorado for being a leader in the movement to take the redistricting function away from legislatures in order to try to come up with a fair and rational process which will benefit all citizens in a equitable fashion.  This is an important step forward both for Colorado, and through our example, for the rest of the country.

I believe that I am intellectually suited and trained to be able to wrestle with the issues that a redistricting committee will face, I have a very strong sense of the importance of fairness, I have strong organizational skills, and, of course, I also am very well versed in map related subjects.","As a dealer in antiquarian maps and prints, I joined the board of the Denver Public Library Friends Foundation almost as soon as I moved to Colorado, from Philadelphia, in 2010.  The library holds an important collection of western material, and both my wife and I are long term supporters of reading as a means for children and adults to improve their lives.  Even once I left the board, I have continued to work with the Friends, running a number of programs for them to help raise awareness and money, including some ""Antiques Roadshow"" type events (I have been a regular appraiser on that TV program) and giving regular, free lectures on maps and prints.  

I have also been a board member of the Rocky Mountain Map Society, running both their regular lecture programs and their annual Map Month every May (except this one).  These are all free programs open to the public.

My wife and I have been regular supporters of a number of local arts groups, including Wonderbound and the Baroque Chamber Orchestra of Colorado, as well as local history related groups such as Historic Denver, History Colorado, Colorado Preservation, and Four Mile Historic Park.  I worked as a board member of the BCOC for three years.","Board member, Denver Public Library Friends Foundation, 2010-2014; Board member, Baroque Chamber Orchestra of Colorado, 2015-2018; Board member, American Historical Print Collectors Society, 2010-2015, 2020-current","I studied philosophy in higher education institutions for almost a decade, and indeed originally planned to teach philosophy as a profession.  Two of my main areas of study were ethics and logic.  The latter is something which I feel is a sine non qua for any rational argument, and indeed I have taught a class in informal logic to high school students as I think it is a skill necessary for any “reasoned life.”  I believe one of my most important and strong skills is the ability to reason in a logical manner.","My academic training was much focused on philosophical argument, in the sense of being able to take an open-minded and clear-eyed look at the issues involved in any particular question to be decided.  I have the ability to identify the core issues of various questions and to present them in a clear and unbiased manner.  Even if I disagree with another person in an argument, I am adept at understanding his/her viewpoint and am able to lay out exactly where and why we disagree.  This does not always solve the argument, but it at least lets the parties understand the real issues involved.

In terms of fairness, my belief in the fundamental importance of fairness is rooted in the moral belief which I hold to be the most important to live by, viz. that everyone should treat others as they wish to be treated.  If one follows this Golden Rule, then fairness necessarily follows, as no one would want to be treated unfairly by another.  I have mostly supported the Democratic Party in the last decade or so, but that support is circumstantial; my support for a fair, equitable political system is far more foundational to my beliefs.","I was a Precinct Committee Person for the Democratic Party, Precinct 623, House District 6, from 2015 to 2016.   My wife and I have made small donations to the Cary Kennedy campaign (2108), and also some small donations to the campaigns of Michael Bennet, for (Senate) and John Hickenlooper (Presidential & Senate)",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/36

I received my Master's in College Student Personnel Administration from Colorado State University in 1976. I received my PhD in College Student Personnel Administration from the University of Northern Colorado in 1987.,"In 1969 I entered Colorado State University (CSU) as a Political Science major. My interest in the democratic process was strong then and has continued to grow. After working at CSU for 44 years and nearing retirement in May 2021 I have maintained my strong interest in volunteer public service and citizen participation in the political process. The Colorado Independent Redistricting Commission offers an excellent opportunity to serve the state of Colorado. The commission provides a solution to promote fair redistricting. I have a strong belief that the process of redistricting should be guided by transparency and public input. Additionally, I believe that maps should fairly reflect the will of the voters and that the redistricting commission can improve outcomes and satisfaction across all stakeholders. Protecting the voting rights of persons-of-color, and balancing the preservation of communities of interest with the preservation of county and municipal boundaries is vitally important. Serving on the commission requires the ability to be fair and impartial. For the past 30 years at CSU, I have served as an Equal Opportunity Representative on university search committees, a responsibility that has fairness and impartiality at its core. Additionally, my doctoral dissertation was on ethical decision-making. I taught an Ethics course at the graduate level for over ten years, conducted ethics workshops for the university and community, and presented on ethical decision making at conferences nationally and internationally. The quest for fairness has been a lifetime endeavor. At CSU, I have served on a joint-appointment as both an administrator and faculty member for 37 years. In my faculty role I served as Program Chair for a Master’s program with over 30 faculty which required the ability to promote consensus and agreement on a daily basis. I was able to develop a collegial environment and build consensus on curricular development, course content, and student issues. Effectively promoting agreement involved listening, collaboration, and clear communication. For the past 12 years I have served at the Executive Director of Assessment and Research at CSU. A position that requires analytical skills and the ability to apply logic. The position involves analyzing numerous quantitative and qualitative research and assessment projects, evaluating programs and services, and guiding departments through their five-year program reviews. I have been very successful in using the data to help the institution increase its effectiveness and improve its programs. I also served at the Director of Research on the board of directors of the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators (NASPA), and chaired the Committee on Commissioned Research for the Association of College and University Housing Officers – International (ACUHO-I). In addition to analytical skills and the application of logic, the coin of the realm in all of these positions is trust and credibility.

I also served at the Director of Research on the board of directors of the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators (NASPA), and chaired the Commissioned Research Task Force for the Association of College and University Housing Officers – International (ACUHO-I).

For the past 30 years at Colorado State University I have served as an Equal Opportunity Representative on university search committees, a responsibility that has fairness and impartiality at its core. Additionally, my doctoral dissertation was on ethical decision-making. I taught an Ethics course at the graduate level for over ten years, conducted ethics workshops for the university and community, and presented on ethical decision making at conferences nationally and internationally. The quest for fairness has been a lifetime endeavor. At CSU, I have served on a joint-appointment as both an administrator and faculty member for 37 years. In my faculty role I served as Program Chair for a Master’s program with over 30 faculty which required the ability to promote consensus and agreement on a daily basis.

Problems can arise from all sorts of angles and it’s my job to anticipate and mitigate those potential issues. In my brewing career, problems were often more acute and required immediate, effective action to resolve. There is little time to deliberate when an enormous tank is leaking, and so I developed a quick response time to problems that does not compromise the effectiveness of the solution. In my academic training, I built a foundation of logical and reasoned analysis since the field of chemistry tolerates no other type of analysis. In my leisure time, I’m always eager to learn a new board game or puzzle because they help me think about strategic problem solving in a new light. Tasks like the Commission’s are a good fit for me.","I have found success throughout my personal and professional life in guiding meetings and conversations to a place that promotes consensus. I once managed a 30-person team of graduate student volunteers, which is a fragile coalition to hold together since students always have competing interests for their time and, being volunteers, I could offer them no material incentives. I was ultimately able to keep the group engaged, and on this and other teams I have relied upon a few key building blocks to set the stage for productive collaboration.


First, confirm goals and check assumptions. Do we have a common understanding of our purpose? Are there facts we all recognize? Many disagreements can be forestalled by establishing a baseline of goals and information that the entire group accepts.


Second, match outcomes to goals. What does success look like? Does this hypothetical result comport with our mission? Why or why not? Holding up possible outcomes for consideration helps ground the group in the reality of their decisions.


Third, connect actions to outcomes. If we take this step, will it lead to the result we want? The result that we agree will help achieve our goals? Actions can be more easily agreed upon if their connections to prior points of consensus are made clear; it is also important to deliberately give proposed actions a reality check for unintended consequences.


Half the battle (at least) of gathering consensus from a diverse group lies in simply avoiding derailment, since tangents constantly threaten to intrude and have a tendency to build their own momentum once instigated. Furthermore, it is crucial to follow good evidence wherever it leads and to be an active listener who strives to hear the truth in the experiences of one’s peers. These steps, attitude, and adherence to evidence are crucial ingredients for impartiality and consensus-building, and I believe a good process leads to good outcomes. While a harmonious ending is never guaranteed, these factors maintain a focus on the right questions and lead to the right conversations. I will strive to foster this collaborative process on the Commission.","Small amounts (<$150) to:

I also completed the welding program at Pickens Technical School in Aurora, CO a long time ago (I was certified but it has lapsed).  I also maintain a CDL with tanker endorsement.","Quite simply, I want two things:  
1. I want rural Colorado to have more of a voice in Colorado politics and decision making.  I believe a thoughtful redistricting will help this.
2. I will be perfectly honest and say that I want to influence the districting.  I have no interest in political office, but I have been concerned at the direction things have taken of late and want to have a hand in shaping the future direction the state goes in.","My experience thus far has been mainly in contacting elected officials, unelected officials, and the media concerning issues that are of importance to me.  My main focus thus far has been in advocating for privacy rights and transparency in using cell phone data to track citizens' movements, advocating for having the (once the initial emergency has been cleared) Colorado Assembly decide how to respond to pandemics rather than one man in the Governor's chair, and advocating for the rural parts of the state to have more of a voice in Colorado government.  I contact people via phone, via email, and have begun using social media as a way to contact officials and to reach directly through to people using my Facebook group Colorado Accountability Project.  I am also trying to encourage others to get involved by contacting their elected officials.","Outside of being a registered Libertarian since I first started voting, I am not a member of any political organizations.  I am not a member of any civic organizations or community organizations either.  Outside of commitments at my work (which wold be mostly internal committees like the Human Resources Leadership Committee) I am not a member of any other associations","I am not sure how to take the word “analytical” in your question; i.e. I am not sure if you mean analytical in terms of the ability to understand and parse an argument or position, or whether you mean analytical in the mathematical/statistical sense.  In either case I feel that I am well suited in this regard.  I did not take the road into academia, but most of my education has been along that line and I regularly work on learning new things in physics (which requires the ability to understand and break down mathematical/logical arguments and the ability to apply math to them).  I will be honest and tell you that my knowledge of some higher level statistics concepts is incomplete, but I learn quickly and don’t anticipate a problem.
As regards the second part of your question, I do not feel as though I will have an issue applying logic and reasoning to a problem.  When you go to solve a problem in physics or mathematics (especially once you are beyond the level of memorizing a formula and into the areas of novel study) that’s exactly what you do.  Interestingly, it’s also what you do when trying to fix something (I’m working on restoring a track loader and help my dad in his semi restorations) though perhaps with less or a different form of math.  I feel as though I am well practiced in this regard.","I am glad I’m coming upon this question a few years after I got married, because I believe being married has greatly shifted (for the better) my perspective on reaching consensus among two people who have strongly-held, opposite opinions.  If you’re also married, I’m sure you understand as well.  My experience thus far has taught me that promoting consensus or agreement starts by recognizing that people of good will can disagree, and that someone else not seeing things the way I do doesn't make them ignorant or careless or etc.   Starting from that point, I think consensus building or compromise takes the form of outlining why you feel the way you do, what your goals are, outlining what you can't live with, and then finding areas of agreement.  For the things that you cannot agree on, you return to what you can't live with, and start saying what you'll tolerate.  I think keeping in mind that the essence of good compromise means that you (and all other parties) will be a little unhappy helps too.  It keeps you focused on what a reasonable outcome will look like.
I would like to say that I’m perfect in regard to being impartial, but I cannot.  Being fair to others, however, is a big value of mine.  In my experience as a teacher, I have had numerous times where I’ve had a student that I didn’t like, or one that sent a nasty email to my boss, or some such.  I have then had the chance to catch that student in a “gotcha” situation—a situation where they’d broken some minor rule or forgotten a homework or some such.  I cannot tell you how good it would have felt to bring the hammer down, but if I allow everyone else one free mistake, I must allow the troublesome students the same grace--difficult as it is.  That’s plain fairness.  It’s how I would want to be treated.  As another example, you may have been able to read between the lines thus far and know that I disagree vehemently with many things that Gov Polis and others have done.  Perhaps not, but let me know make it explicitly clear.  I disagree vehemently with many of the policy decisions and actions that Polis and others have undertaken.  In my Facebook group posts (Colorado Accountability Project—you’re welcome to go see), I do my best in posting to not step outside the truth and to be fair.  For example, in a recent post (recent as I write this on 8/13), I wrote some notes on Polis taking grant money to fund some of his political priorities.  The very first thing I wrote is that it’s not illegal and he has not been the first governor to do so","This one will be brief.  My political activity is mostly recent.  I have, of course, voted in every election since I was eligible and try to do my due diligence on informing myself of the initiatives and etc. on the ballot, but it wasn't until recently (actually it was Gov Polis emergency declaration and state shutdown that spurred it) that I became more actively involved.  I have not ever, and do not plan to ever, donate money to any campaign, candidate, or political organization.  I have, however, spent a great deal of time emailing and talking to both elected and unelected people in the areas of interest to me in an effort to influence and change what I have seen happening lately in Colorado.  I have also (because the response rate from officials and the media can be dishearteningly small) begun to create groups and use social media to expand my reach and to go directly to people.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/79

Now the citizens of the state have made concrete efforts to move the redistricting process out of politics and government (per se.) I believe individuals such as myself should volunteer to take the experience, training, and leadership learned over years of making people and systems work correctly and put those skills to use making the redistricting work for the citizens, not the politicized governmental establishment. All Colorado citizens deserve to have themselves and their neighbors properly represented in our fantastic democratic republic. Colorado is diverse from many different perspectives - some rural some urban, some mountains - some plains, some agriculture - some energy, some business – some labor, etc. The list goes on. Each perspective deserves the ability to express its collective, and sometimes unique, needs, desires, & contributions, via both the federal and state representations. Who wouldn’t want to be part of that?","In addition to the GOP County Central Committee above, I have been active in the non-profit Rocky Mountain Wing (RMW) Commemorative Air Force (CAF) serving on the Wing Staff as both Education Officer and as the Wing Newsletter Editor.

Without question, piloting today's aircraft in ""the crowded skies"" requires logic and reasoning skills above the norm. Most piloting (with perhaps the exception of crop dusting)can be hours of boredom interspersed with moments of terror! Those moments of terror require logic and reasoning skills way beyond those necessary to put together a contract for a worldwide computer packet switching network. Operating within one environment compliments the other - I speak from experience in both cases. Gathering known reliable and meaningful data, using demonstrated means to analyze the data for information pertinent to the problem at hand, applying the information in acceptable means, and then making sound decisions based on the data - not other outside emotionally charged input - is the path to success - both in the cockpit and the boardroom.

I know, developmentally, that children do not tend to learn these things until age 4-5. I contact the teacher to see what lessons she is presenting to the children regarding numbers and letters. She shows me how she introduces them one at a time through a game. I do some research and find that new concepts must be presented at least 500 times to children 3-5 years old before a concept gets incorporated into their brains. I sit down with both the teacher and parent and present what is happening in the classroom and what I found in my research.

I want to be active in crafting solutions that benefit Colorado voters statewide. I consider myself a life-long learner, a good listener, a team worker and a fair person.","My experience has been limited to my career as a public school educator. Within that role and responsibility I have organized groups of students, teachers, parents and community members for literacy programs, National Honor Society membership and initiatives, College Board activities and classes, and participation in National History Day competitions and judging.","Independent Voter, I was a member of the Denver Classroom Teachers Association prior to my retirement in 2016. A member of the Colorado Geographic Alliance and the American Library Association.","In achieving my Masters in Library and Information Science from the University of Denver in 2007 I had many opportunities to apply sophisticated analysis to situations and scenarios presented as part of my course work and in my subsequent employment as a librarian. From developing authentic collections and embracing the needs of diverse patrons to budget considerations within unique tax districts, the focus on analyzing data enabled me to chart a clear path for providing relevant and productive library service for all. My ability to apply logic and reason to a problem is perhaps best illustrated by my work as a reader for the College Board’s Advanced Placement United States History exam. As a reader, our job is to read and score (according to a pre-set rubric) student’s essays answering one topic question during a seven day session that begins each day at 8am and ends at 5pm. The same question over and over, but answered by high school students from all over the country (as well as those attending international schools). We each read hundreds of essays daily by students whose skill sets vary wildly. Our goal as readers is to award the students for what they know – not punish them for what they omit or get wrong. Many times logic dictates that the student answered the prompt correctly, looking at their writing holistically, and even though there might be minor errors in their writing. Reason takes that logic by the hand and reminds us as readers that the student wrote the essay in 45 minutes, under extreme pressure and without prior knowledge of the prompt. So when we spend the two to three minutes reading and scoring each essay we embrace that reason and logic and our goal to benefit the student’s effort is realized.","I will promote consensus by being patient in listening to all points of view expressed and by maintaining flexibility in my own opinions. I believe my career as a public school teacher has helped shape my skills in this regard. High School students share their thoughts and opinions about absolutely everything. An integral part of being a good teacher is listening to what they have to say without verbal or visual signs of judgement, and then working towards an answer, resolution or consideration. This skill was, and is, often tested when what is said clashes with my own ideas or realities. That is where the work gets more difficult and can be more rewarding. Often in committee meetings, parent conferences, as well as mentoring new teachers, the same patience and honest listening is needed. Especially in these challenging times, I have no doubt that building agreement with any diverse group of people will be difficult. I believe with my personal history and experience I am up to the task.","My past political activity has mostly involved teaching my high school Social Studies students about local, state, national government, civic participation and the U.S. Constitution.

Among other things, this means that district lines are not written in such a way to ensure a particular outcome, but rather that citizens in each district are given real choice with candidates that attend to the needs and interests of the population.  Second, I am a strong believer in shared community responsibility.  While it is easy to criticize the decisions of others, we often forget how difficult it is to shoulder the decisions.

Not all social phenomena are measurable or accepted as valid, and thus I am also very much attuned to how ideas are communicated, sometimes very intentionally designed to divide.  I have also paid attention to the details of redistricting (legal rules, political manuevering, technology aids in achieving politically-favored results, etc.).  While I cannot claim expertise in mapping, I am an analytical thinker and balanced thinker who can spot bias.","Being even-handed and building consensus are critical practices in my teaching and community service.  I seek to identify needs and shared interests in building towards agreement -- moving away from hard positions to language that fosters a commitment to supporting our common ground.  I have long used the negotiation principles and practices developed in the book ""Getting to Yes.""  
In terms of my ability to be fair or impartial, these are practices critical in any effective community activity or in the teaching environment, and most particularly in the contemporary political science class. I communicate to students at the outset that we should expect disagreement and this is partly due to our different sets of life experiences.  Furthermore, none of us has a lock on ""the truth,"" and instead it is the collective set of perspectives that will help us to identify our common reality and get us closer to ""the truth.""  This is akin to the traditional Indian parable, ""the blind men and the elephant.""  With this at the foundation, I am committed to not only giving fair and equal voice to competing perspectives, but also asking individuals to ""step into the shoes of the other"" as we consider why we might disagree.  I favor coming to the middle rather than than win-lose outcomes.","As an academic focused on American politics, I am an avid observer of politics, including of redistricting politics.

An independent team to perform redistricting is a great step in the right direction for true representation of the people of Colorado. I would be honored to work with a team of people to achieve that goal in a bipartisan manner!,"Our HOA covenants was set up unfairly such that more than 1/2 of the community was paying more for HOA fees than others and the disparity was growing every time HOA fees were raised because of a covenant rule that stated a portion of the neighborhood was required to pay 1.5 times more than the other portion. The fees are used for maintenance of amenities in the community to which all households have equal access.  I lead the committee to research (with the help of a couple of board members) how we could change the covenants and educate the community on how the fees were used for amenities shared across the community. We learned that we would have to have an election to add an amendment to remove the 1.5 times rule. 

I sent out polls for the community to vote on preferred methods of equalizing the fees. Although this seemed like an insurmountable task, the poll indicated that 18 or 19 of the homeowners who were paying less would vote for the change to the covenants and increase their fees.  This was an indication that the task was not insurmountable and we proceeded with community meetings and presentations which I put together. Two board members and I presented the information.  An election was held and the committee and I canvassed the neighborhood to make sure everyone was aware of the amendment and voted.  All of the 153 households that were currently paying more needed to vote to pass the amendment since the margin was going to be so slim. This was a harder task than it would seem, since some of these homes were rented and/or the owners were hard to reach, or they were in the process of moving.  In addition, 20 households that were paying less were needed to vote for the amendment and increase their fees. 22 (2 more than the 20 needed) neighbors voted for the amendment and raising their fees, while 100% of the homes who had been paying more voted in approval of equalizing fees.

Software teams are often comprised of intelligent, strong-willed individuals.  I ran design and code reviews and was able to facilitate buy-in to best approaches based on requirements and goals. 

I have an MS in Landscape Architecture and Urban design which required a great deal of analytical work in mapping and design where I used Adobe software such as Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, and CAD to represent design proposals to a jury of faculty. 

With my HOA committee team and a couple of board members were were able to resolve a contentious issue that had existed since our community's inception (around 12 years).  Nobody thought we’d be successful but we were! This involved some neighbors voting to pay more in fees until theirs were equal to what other neighbors had been paying (as detailed above in the volunteer experience section above).","It comes down to keeping the goals and requirements impartially in mind, communicating them, listening, and compromising where possible.

As a poll watcher, I impartially looked for inconsistencies and areas of weakness in the election system.  I worked well in a bipartisan team during the Risk Limiting Audit (RLA) of the primary election.  I was a team lead and applications architect for developing software.  In my software career, I worked successfully with intelligent co-workers to resolve and compromise on design issues.  
I and the rest of the HOA team was able to convince people that were paying less in HOA fees to see that it wasn't right that some people were paying more for the same amenities. I was also able to communicate effectively with people that were upset over changing HOA fee covenant rules by listening, discussion, and outreach via presenting researched information, and holding Q&A sessions.

I also feel that my background in QA is something that is needed on the commission. QA requires a unique perspective where your main goal is to point out flaws without making them into personal attacks.

I am trained to look for logical flaws in calculations. I understand that trust comes from testing and confirmation, not pretty presentation or slick graphics. I write user stories and test cases constantly, using logic and reason to analyze how any particular program or piece of data will be used. Formal logic is a large part of determining positive and negative paths for test cases. I use reason to perform root cause analysis and identify areas of regression.
I am experienced in handling large data sets, data transformations, graphing, and statistics. I am capable of taking raw data sets and writing my own queries and analysis in several different programming languages and tools. I have spent years analyzing calculations that others have written looking for flaws in logic and reason. I have previously worked with a wide variety of data type including demographic data, economic data, and medical billing data.  I am well versed in performing needs analysis, regression analysis, happy path and negative path testing, and gap analysis. 

In terms of skills, I have taken courses in formal logic, economics, business, mathematics, and philosophy. I am a certified Agile Scrum Master and Product Owner. I have taken training in Project Management and interpersonal relationships. I have experiencing leading teams of other engineers. 
Some of the projects I have worked on include: Writing a web application to handle mortgage applications, developing an HR system to track employee complaints, doing document analysis to assemble evidence for EPA criminal prosecutions, programming predictive dialing systems for customer service agents, and performing security auditing at a credit agency. I am currently employed at a DoD contractor working on network security software.","As a QA lead and release manager, I have spent the last decade working to build consensuses between various stakeholders involved in a a number of different projects. I recognize that it is important to hear and address all voices that have an interest in the outcome, but that you cannot let the perfect become the enemy of the good. Sooner or later you have to make decisions and an imperfect decision made timely is better than a perfect decision made too late. You will never fix all bugs in a piece of software, or in a redistricting map, but that doesn't mean you can't release a good or even great piece of work. I believe that the key to being a functional team is to have a strong set of core values and working towards those. As long as you have strategic alignment, individual issues become a series of small tactical compromises that allow each group to feel their voice is being heard. I would work to identify the strategic goals of the commission and apply software engineering methodology, where appropriate, to resolve the disagreements. Software development is a lot like politics, as it should be a meritocracy but in reality tends to be dominated by individuals with strong personalities.

My academic training was mostly in philosophy (with a smattering of political science), and one of my main interests was in ethics.  The intersection of democracy and ethics is the notion of equity for all citizens; viz. that every person has equal say and power to shape the nature of the political bodies which affect his/her live.

The way that voting districts are set up is, obviously, the foundation of whether any particular system is equitable or not.  Redistricting has been used for partisan purposes—by all political parties—from well before Governor Gerry ‘gerrymandered’ the Massachusetts districts in 1812 up to today.  This has been the source of a considerable lack of fairness in our political system.

I am proud of Colorado for being a leader in the movement to take the redistricting function away from legislatures in order to try to come up with a fair and rational process which will benefit all citizens in a equitable fashion.  This is an important step forward both for Colorado, and through our example, for the rest of the country.  I would be honored and excited to be able to participate in this important work.","As a dealer in antiquarian maps and prints, I joined the board of the Denver Public Library Friends Foundation almost as soon as I moved to Colorado, from Philadelphia, in 2010.

Even once I left the board, I have continued to work with the Friends, running a number of programs for them to help raise awareness and money, including some ""Antiques Roadshow"" type events (I have been a regular appraiser on that TV program) and giving regular, free lectures on maps and prints.  

I have also been a board member of the Rocky Mountain Map Society, running both their regular lecture programs and their annual Map Month every May (except this one).  These are all free programs open to the public.

My wife and I have been regular supporters of a number of local arts groups, including Wonderbound and the Baroque Chamber Orchestra of Colorado, as well as local history related groups such as Historic Denver, History Colorado, Colorado Preservation, and Four Mile Historic Park.

Two of my main areas of study were ethics and logic.  The latter is something which I feel is a sine non qua for any rational argument, and indeed I have taught a class in informal logic to high school students as I think it is a skill necessary for any “reasoned life.”  I believe one of my most important and strong skills is the ability to reason in a logical manner.","I believe that I am intellectually suited and trained to be able to wrestle with the issues that a redistricting committee will face, I have a very strong sense of the importance of fairness, I have strong organizational skills, and, of course, I also am very well versed in map related subjects.

My academic training was much focused on philosophical argument, in the sense of being able to take an open-minded and clear-eyed look at the issues involved in any particular question to be decided.  I have the ability to identify the core issues of various questions and to present them in a clear and unbiased manner.  Even if I disagree with another person in an argument, I am adept at understanding his/her viewpoint and am able to lay out exactly where and why we disagree.  This does not always solve the argument, but it at least lets the parties understand the real issues involved.

In terms of fairness, my belief in the fundamental importance of fairness is rooted in the moral belief which I hold to be the most important to live by, viz. that everyone should treat others as they wish to be treated.  If one follows this Golden Rule, then fairness necessarily follows, as no one would want to be treated unfairly by another.  I have mostly supported the Democratic Party in the last decade or so, but that support is circumstantial; my support for a fair, equitable political system is far more foundational to my beliefs.","I was a Precinct Committee Person for the Democratic Party, Precinct 623, House District 6, from 2015 to 2016.

I served as a School District Superintendent at the same district for 14 years.",AAS and BS in Electronic Engineering Technology.  Masters in Special Education.   Teaching license in Secondary Math.  Endorsements in Principal Leadership and School Administration.,"""An Attitude of Servitude"" has always been a high priority for me.  As I researched this appointment, I wondered if there were many rural applicants.  Farming has been in my family for generations and I feel I have many rural contacts that can offer their perspectives on redistricting.  I also have experience in serving on committees with a timeline for reaching a complex goal.  The research and knowledge gained in this endeavor is appealing to me.","Serving as a school superintendent in a rural area, yet keenly aware of  Colorado Department of Education (CDE)'s roles and responsibilities gave me the opportunity to serve as a liason in several CDE efforts.  Served on a panel of school superintendents to the Commissioner of Education, served on a panel updating CDE's School Evaluation system, member of a team using data analysis to rate districts, and served on panel updating the school evaluation system.  I also helped our local Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) by serving on Superintendent's Advisory Council and designing and teaching classes on School Data Analysis.  
Served on a panel of six Board Members representing landowners on the most recent pipeline project through eastern Colorado.  Served as their Treasurer, but also as a spokesperson and organizer for landowner meetings and our legal counsel.","Member of the Colorado Association of School Board members, Colorado Association of School Administrators, serve as a treasurer for our local church.   Active in the local church, and serve as the Treasurer and Missions Committee Chair, and serve on the Advisory Council.    Long standing member of our local Lion’s Club.  Board member for Pro Colorado, LLC; an organization for landowners who have an oil pipeline crossing them.",,"Many Problem-Solving strategies are readily available.  I’ve experienced several during my previous committee work and enjoy participating in different models.  Brain storming strategies allow getting all ideas identified, and participants feel heard.  Using the brain storming ideas can be used to find commonalities, potential roadblocks, and priorities.   People who work with me know I will call on the members who have been quiet or not offering any input.  Some issues and conflicts can carry emotional reactions.  Best hopes/worst fears can move the group to look at the emotions in a rational way.  Understanding each other’s background and experiences gives insight into interpretations.  
I also believe summarizing all points brought up lets all see that the solution must cover multiple areas.  Setting priorities allows for a potential ranking to see what the solution must cover.  Reminding participants that no one group may get everything they want, and that the compromises must look equitable from a 360-degree perspective.  When there seems to be a conflict appearing, I remind all of the goal at hand, and the things we have agreed to so far.   This strategy helps to get the mindset of rational thought as our tool to continue.","I have not donated money to any campaigns or political organizations.  I choose to vote in every election, written numerous letters and emails to state legislative members both personally and professionally.   Participated in the county caucus.  As a member of a multi-school BOCES, we had updates about the legislature's procedures from January to May.  Members of the BOCES testified at the legislature about impacts on proposed bills.  Since I served the BOCES (Board of Cooperative Educational Services) with CDE (Colorado Department of Education) work, I offered input at the Superintendent  Advisory Council meetings where the legislature testimony was discussed.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/617

I have an admirable track record in this field. I was sought out as a member of various boards due to my cool head and logical approach. I take an analytical approach to see the basic problem and where a varied group are coming from.I use these skills to break down the issue to it's basic parts rather than address the emotions which may arise. In leading classroom discussions it was my job to facilitate civil discourse and promote interaction by all attendees (students). I have been in the role of mediator in public events as well as moderator of panel discussions.","As a high school social studies teacher for 20 years I led discussions of current and historical topics. Students' opinions were often divided on the impact of these topics. It was my job to facilitate a lively, and productive, discussion in my classroom. I did this successfully to over 2,000 students in my career. I often find that adults, like their previous lives as teenagers, respond to the same manner of facilitation as is used in the classroom. In governmental and civic situations when i see adults arguing  am reminded of my classroom days. The secret is not to get flustered or upset but to deal with the underlying issues of contention and discuss them rationally. I moderate quite well.
In addition, as mentioned above, having lived in several types of communities throughout the state and having belonged to various political parties I feel that I have a leg up on what drives people to disagree and what it takes to accommodate those differences.","MB Mcafee for county commissioner
