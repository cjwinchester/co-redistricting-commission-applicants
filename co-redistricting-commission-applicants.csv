Among other things, this means that district lines are not written in such a way to ensure a particular outcome, but rather that citizens in each district are given real choice with candidates that attend to the needs and interests of the population.  Second, I am a strong believer in shared community responsibility.  While it is easy to criticize the decisions of others, we often forget how difficult it is to shoulder the decisions.  I offer my time and effort to share that responsibility.","I have concentrated my efforts on addressing environmental issues and community support.  These are issues I take a hands-on approach to through my volunteer activities and then focus on through my classes (regularly teaching an upper division course at CU Boulder focused on environmental policy, for example)","Boulder Rotary Club; American Red Cross (Boulder-Broomfield Chapter, Disaster Action Team); Institute for Environmental Solutions (steering committee for CO community projects, 2014-present); Global Greengrants (pro bono researcher, 2017-2019); Eco-Cycle (pro bono research associate, 2016-2017); Wild Foundation (pro bono project coordinator, 2015); Colorado Alliance for Environmental Educators; North American Association for Environmental Educators; Community Food Share (weekly volunteer in food distribution, 2015-2018)","I am well-steeped in a variety of analytical methods, from quantitative to qualitative analysis, and seek the best available data to build understanding.  Not all social phenomena are measurable or accepted as valid, and thus I am also very much attuned to how ideas are communicated, sometimes very intentionally designed to divide.  I have also paid attention to the details of redistricting (legal rules, political manuevering, technology aids in achieving politically-favored results, etc.).  While I cannot claim expertise in mapping, I am an analytical thinker and balanced thinker who can spot bias.","Being even-handed and building consensus are critical practices in my teaching and community service.  I seek to identify needs and shared interests in building towards agreement -- moving away from hard positions to language that fosters a commitment to supporting our common ground.  I have long used the negotiation principles and practices developed in the book ""Getting to Yes.""  
In terms of my ability to be fair or impartial, these are practices critical in any effective community activity or in the teaching environment, and most particularly in the contemporary political science class. I communicate to students at the outset that we should expect disagreement and this is partly due to our different sets of life experiences.  Furthermore, none of us has a lock on ""the truth,"" and instead it is the collective set of perspectives that will help us to identify our common reality and get us closer to ""the truth.""  This is akin to the traditional Indian parable, ""the blind men and the elephant.""  With this at the foundation, I am committed to not only giving fair and equal voice to competing perspectives, but also asking individuals to ""step into the shoes of the other"" as we consider why we might disagree.  I favor coming to the middle rather than than win-lose outcomes.","As an academic focused on American politics, I am an avid observer of politics, including of redistricting politics.  I regularly teach undergraduates on issues of American politics, including on the US Congress, and oversee students engaged in political and campaign-related internships (for all political parties and a wide range of candidates at local, state and national levels).

I also completed the welding program at Pickens Technical School in Aurora, CO a long time ago (I was certified but it has lapsed).  I also maintain a CDL with tanker endorsement.","Quite simply, I want two things:  
1. I want rural Colorado to have more of a voice in Colorado politics and decision making.  I believe a thoughtful redistricting will help this.
2. I will be perfectly honest and say that I want to influence the districting.  I have no interest in political office, but I have been concerned at the direction things have taken of late and want to have a hand in shaping the future direction the state goes in.","My experience thus far has been mainly in contacting elected officials, unelected officials, and the media concerning issues that are of importance to me.  My main focus thus far has been in advocating for privacy rights and transparency in using cell phone data to track citizens' movements, advocating for having the (once the initial emergency has been cleared) Colorado Assembly decide how to respond to pandemics rather than one man in the Governor's chair, and advocating for the rural parts of the state to have more of a voice in Colorado government.  I contact people via phone, via email, and have begun using social media as a way to contact officials and to reach directly through to people using my Facebook group Colorado Accountability Project.  I am also trying to encourage others to get involved by contacting their elected officials.","Outside of being a registered Libertarian since I first started voting, I am not a member of any political organizations.  I am not a member of any civic organizations or community organizations either.  Outside of commitments at my work (which wold be mostly internal committees like the Human Resources Leadership Committee) I am not a member of any other associations","I am not sure how to take the word “analytical” in your question; i.e. I am not sure if you mean analytical in terms of the ability to understand and parse an argument or position, or whether you mean analytical in the mathematical/statistical sense.  In either case I feel that I am well suited in this regard.  I did not take the road into academia, but most of my education has been along that line and I regularly work on learning new things in physics (which requires the ability to understand and break down mathematical/logical arguments and the ability to apply math to them).  I will be honest and tell you that my knowledge of some higher level statistics concepts is incomplete, but I learn quickly and don’t anticipate a problem.
As regards the second part of your question, I do not feel as though I will have an issue applying logic and reasoning to a problem.  When you go to solve a problem in physics or mathematics (especially once you are beyond the level of memorizing a formula and into the areas of novel study) that’s exactly what you do.  Interestingly, it’s also what you do when trying to fix something (I’m working on restoring a track loader and help my dad in his semi restorations) though perhaps with less or a different form of math.  I feel as though I am well practiced in this regard.","I am glad I’m coming upon this question a few years after I got married, because I believe being married has greatly shifted (for the better) my perspective on reaching consensus among two people who have strongly-held, opposite opinions.  If you’re also married, I’m sure you understand as well.  My experience thus far has taught me that promoting consensus or agreement starts by recognizing that people of good will can disagree, and that someone else not seeing things the way I do doesn't make them ignorant or careless or etc.   Starting from that point, I think consensus building or compromise takes the form of outlining why you feel the way you do, what your goals are, outlining what you can't live with, and then finding areas of agreement.  For the things that you cannot agree on, you return to what you can't live with, and start saying what you'll tolerate.  I think keeping in mind that the essence of good compromise means that you (and all other parties) will be a little unhappy helps too.  It keeps you focused on what a reasonable outcome will look like.
I would like to say that I’m perfect in regard to being impartial, but I cannot.  Being fair to others, however, is a big value of mine.  In my experience as a teacher, I have had numerous times where I’ve had a student that I didn’t like, or one that sent a nasty email to my boss, or some such.  I have then had the chance to catch that student in a “gotcha” situation—a situation where they’d broken some minor rule or forgotten a homework or some such.  I cannot tell you how good it would have felt to bring the hammer down, but if I allow everyone else one free mistake, I must allow the troublesome students the same grace--difficult as it is.  That’s plain fairness.  It’s how I would want to be treated.  As another example, you may have been able to read between the lines thus far and know that I disagree vehemently with many things that Gov Polis and others have done.  Perhaps not, but let me know make it explicitly clear.  I disagree vehemently with many of the policy decisions and actions that Polis and others have undertaken.  In my Facebook group posts (Colorado Accountability Project—you’re welcome to go see), I do my best in posting to not step outside the truth and to be fair.  For example, in a recent post (recent as I write this on 8/13), I wrote some notes on Polis taking grant money to fund some of his political priorities.  The very first thing I wrote is that it’s not illegal and he has not been the first governor to do so","This one will be brief.  My political activity is mostly recent.  I have, of course, voted in every election since I was eligible and try to do my due diligence on informing myself of the initiatives and etc. on the ballot, but it wasn't until recently (actually it was Gov Polis emergency declaration and state shutdown that spurred it) that I became more actively involved.  I have not ever, and do not plan to ever, donate money to any campaign, candidate, or political organization.  I have, however, spent a great deal of time emailing and talking to both elected and unelected people in the areas of interest to me in an effort to influence and change what I have seen happening lately in Colorado.  I have also (because the response rate from officials and the media can be dishearteningly small) begun to create groups and use social media to expand my reach and to go directly to people.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/77

Problems can arise from all sorts of angles and it’s my job to anticipate and mitigate those potential issues. In my brewing career, problems were often more acute and required immediate, effective action to resolve. There is little time to deliberate when an enormous tank is leaking, and so I developed a quick response time to problems that does not compromise the effectiveness of the solution. In my academic training, I built a foundation of logical and reasoned analysis since the field of chemistry tolerates no other type of analysis. In my leisure time, I’m always eager to learn a new board game or puzzle because they help me think about strategic problem solving in a new light. Tasks like the Commission’s are a good fit for me.","I have found success throughout my personal and professional life in guiding meetings and conversations to a place that promotes consensus. I once managed a 30-person team of graduate student volunteers, which is a fragile coalition to hold together since students always have competing interests for their time and, being volunteers, I could offer them no material incentives. I was ultimately able to keep the group engaged, and on this and other teams I have relied upon a few key building blocks to set the stage for productive collaboration.


Confirm goals and check assumptions: Do we have a common understanding of our purpose? Are there facts we all recognize? Many disagreements can be forestalled by establishing a baseline of goals and information that the entire group accepts.


Match outcomes to goals: What does success look like? Does this hypothetical result comport with our mission? Why or why not? Holding up possible outcomes for consideration helps ground the group in the reality of their decisions.


Connect actions to outcomes: If we take this step, will it lead to the result we want? The result that we agree will help achieve our goals? Actions can be more easily agreed upon if their connections to prior points of consensus are made clear; it is also important to deliberately give proposed actions a reality check for unintended consequences.


Half the battle (at least) of gathering consensus from a diverse group lies in simply avoiding derailment, since tangents constantly threaten to intrude and have a tendency to build their own momentum once instigated. Furthermore, it is crucial to follow good evidence wherever it leads and to be an active listener who strives to hear the truth in the experiences of one’s peers. These steps, attitude, and adherence to evidence are crucial ingredients for impartiality and consensus-building, and I believe a good process leads to good outcomes. While a harmonious ending is never guaranteed, these factors maintain a focus on the right questions and lead to the right conversations. I will strive to foster this collaborative process on the Commission.","Small amounts (<$150) to:

I developed a special interest in domestic violence victimology, which lead to me serving on the YWCA board.

I joined League after I joined the Pueblo County ACOVA program, largely so I could be a more effective advocate for domestic violence victims. I was allowed to represent League on the Pueblo Domestic Violence Task Force, and became it's vice chair in the late 2000s.

Problems can arise from all sorts of angles and it’s my job to anticipate and mitigate those potential issues. In my brewing career, problems were often more acute and required immediate, effective action to resolve. There is little time to deliberate when an enormous tank is leaking, and so I developed a quick response time to problems that does not compromise the effectiveness of the solution. In my academic training, I built a foundation of logical and reasoned analysis since the field of chemistry tolerates no other type of analysis. In my leisure time, I’m always eager to learn a new board game or puzzle because they help me think about strategic problem solving in a new light. Tasks like the Commission’s are a good fit for me.","I have found success throughout my personal and professional life in guiding meetings and conversations to a place that promotes consensus. I once managed a 30-person team of graduate student volunteers, which is a fragile coalition to hold together since students always have competing interests for their time and, being volunteers, I could offer them no material incentives. I was ultimately able to keep the group engaged, and on this and other teams I have relied upon a few key building blocks to set the stage for productive collaboration.


First, confirm goals and check assumptions. Do we have a common understanding of our purpose? Are there facts we all recognize? Many disagreements can be forestalled by establishing a baseline of goals and information that the entire group accepts.


Second, match outcomes to goals. What does success look like? Does this hypothetical result comport with our mission? Why or why not? Holding up possible outcomes for consideration helps ground the group in the reality of their decisions.


Third, connect actions to outcomes. If we take this step, will it lead to the result we want? The result that we agree will help achieve our goals? Actions can be more easily agreed upon if their connections to prior points of consensus are made clear; it is also important to deliberately give proposed actions a reality check for unintended consequences.


Half the battle (at least) of gathering consensus from a diverse group lies in simply avoiding derailment, since tangents constantly threaten to intrude and have a tendency to build their own momentum once instigated. Furthermore, it is crucial to follow good evidence wherever it leads and to be an active listener who strives to hear the truth in the experiences of one’s peers. These steps, attitude, and adherence to evidence are crucial ingredients for impartiality and consensus-building, and I believe a good process leads to good outcomes. While a harmonious ending is never guaranteed, these factors maintain a focus on the right questions and lead to the right conversations. I will strive to foster this collaborative process on the Commission.","Small amounts (<$150) to:

I also completed the welding program at Pickens Technical School in Aurora, CO a long time ago (I was certified but it has lapsed).  I also maintain a CDL with tanker endorsement.","Quite simply, I want two things:  
1. I want rural Colorado to have more of a voice in Colorado politics and decision making.  I believe a thoughtful redistricting will help this.
2. I will be perfectly honest and say that I want to influence the districting.  I have no interest in political office, but I have been concerned at the direction things have taken of late and want to have a hand in shaping the future direction the state goes in.","My experience thus far has been mainly in contacting elected officials, unelected officials, and the media concerning issues that are of importance to me.  My main focus thus far has been in advocating for privacy rights and transparency in using cell phone data to track citizens' movements, advocating for having the (once the initial emergency has been cleared) Colorado Assembly decide how to respond to pandemics rather than one man in the Governor's chair, and advocating for the rural parts of the state to have more of a voice in Colorado government.  I contact people via phone, via email, and have begun using social media as a way to contact officials and to reach directly through to people using my Facebook group Colorado Accountability Project.  I am also trying to encourage others to get involved by contacting their elected officials.","Outside of being a registered Libertarian since I first started voting, I am not a member of any political organizations.  I am not a member of any civic organizations or community organizations either.  Outside of commitments at my work (which wold be mostly internal committees like the Human Resources Leadership Committee) I am not a member of any other associations","I am not sure how to take the word “analytical” in your question; i.e. I am not sure if you mean analytical in terms of the ability to understand and parse an argument or position, or whether you mean analytical in the mathematical/statistical sense.  In either case I feel that I am well suited in this regard.  I did not take the road into academia, but most of my education has been along that line and I regularly work on learning new things in physics (which requires the ability to understand and break down mathematical/logical arguments and the ability to apply math to them).  I will be honest and tell you that my knowledge of some higher level statistics concepts is incomplete, but I learn quickly and don’t anticipate a problem.
As regards the second part of your question, I do not feel as though I will have an issue applying logic and reasoning to a problem.  When you go to solve a problem in physics or mathematics (especially once you are beyond the level of memorizing a formula and into the areas of novel study) that’s exactly what you do.  Interestingly, it’s also what you do when trying to fix something (I’m working on restoring a track loader and help my dad in his semi restorations) though perhaps with less or a different form of math.  I feel as though I am well practiced in this regard.","I am glad I’m coming upon this question a few years after I got married, because I believe being married has greatly shifted (for the better) my perspective on reaching consensus among two people who have strongly-held, opposite opinions.  If you’re also married, I’m sure you understand as well.  My experience thus far has taught me that promoting consensus or agreement starts by recognizing that people of good will can disagree, and that someone else not seeing things the way I do doesn't make them ignorant or careless or etc.   Starting from that point, I think consensus building or compromise takes the form of outlining why you feel the way you do, what your goals are, outlining what you can't live with, and then finding areas of agreement.  For the things that you cannot agree on, you return to what you can't live with, and start saying what you'll tolerate.  I think keeping in mind that the essence of good compromise means that you (and all other parties) will be a little unhappy helps too.  It keeps you focused on what a reasonable outcome will look like.
I would like to say that I’m perfect in regard to being impartial, but I cannot.  Being fair to others, however, is a big value of mine.  In my experience as a teacher, I have had numerous times where I’ve had a student that I didn’t like, or one that sent a nasty email to my boss, or some such.  I have then had the chance to catch that student in a “gotcha” situation—a situation where they’d broken some minor rule or forgotten a homework or some such.  I cannot tell you how good it would have felt to bring the hammer down, but if I allow everyone else one free mistake, I must allow the troublesome students the same grace--difficult as it is.  That’s plain fairness.  It’s how I would want to be treated.  As another example, you may have been able to read between the lines thus far and know that I disagree vehemently with many things that Gov Polis and others have done.  Perhaps not, but let me know make it explicitly clear.  I disagree vehemently with many of the policy decisions and actions that Polis and others have undertaken.  In my Facebook group posts (Colorado Accountability Project—you’re welcome to go see), I do my best in posting to not step outside the truth and to be fair.  For example, in a recent post (recent as I write this on 8/13), I wrote some notes on Polis taking grant money to fund some of his political priorities.  The very first thing I wrote is that it’s not illegal and he has not been the first governor to do so","This one will be brief.  My political activity is mostly recent.  I have, of course, voted in every election since I was eligible and try to do my due diligence on informing myself of the initiatives and etc. on the ballot, but it wasn't until recently (actually it was Gov Polis emergency declaration and state shutdown that spurred it) that I became more actively involved.  I have not ever, and do not plan to ever, donate money to any campaign, candidate, or political organization.  I have, however, spent a great deal of time emailing and talking to both elected and unelected people in the areas of interest to me in an effort to influence and change what I have seen happening lately in Colorado.

Among other things, this means that district lines are not written in such a way to ensure a particular outcome, but rather that citizens in each district are given real choice with candidates that attend to the needs and interests of the population.  Second, I am a strong believer in shared community responsibility.  While it is easy to criticize the decisions of others, we often forget how difficult it is to shoulder the decisions.  I offer my time and effort to share that responsibility.","I have concentrated my efforts on addressing environmental issues and community support.  These are issues I take a hands-on approach to through my volunteer activities and then focus on through my classes (regularly teaching an upper division course at CU Boulder focused on environmental policy, for example)","Boulder Rotary Club; American Red Cross (Boulder-Broomfield Chapter, Disaster Action Team); Institute for Environmental Solutions (steering committee for CO community projects, 2014-present); Global Greengrants (pro bono researcher, 2017-2019); Eco-Cycle (pro bono research associate, 2016-2017); Wild Foundation (pro bono project coordinator, 2015); Colorado Alliance for Environmental Educators; North American Association for Environmental Educators; Community Food Share (weekly volunteer in food distribution, 2015-2018)","I am well-steeped in a variety of analytical methods, from quantitative to qualitative analysis, and seek the best available data to build understanding.  Not all social phenomena are measurable or accepted as valid, and thus I am also very much attuned to how ideas are communicated, sometimes very intentionally designed to divide.  I have also paid attention to the details of redistricting (legal rules, political manuevering, technology aids in achieving politically-favored results, etc.).  While I cannot claim expertise in mapping, I am an analytical thinker and balanced thinker who can spot bias.","Being even-handed and building consensus are critical practices in my teaching and community service.  I seek to identify needs and shared interests in building towards agreement -- moving away from hard positions to language that fosters a commitment to supporting our common ground.  I have long used the negotiation principles and practices developed in the book ""Getting to Yes.""  
In terms of my ability to be fair or impartial, these are practices critical in any effective community activity or in the teaching environment, and most particularly in the contemporary political science class. I communicate to students at the outset that we should expect disagreement and this is partly due to our different sets of life experiences.  Furthermore, none of us has a lock on ""the truth,"" and instead it is the collective set of perspectives that will help us to identify our common reality and get us closer to ""the truth.""  This is akin to the traditional Indian parable, ""the blind men and the elephant.""  With this at the foundation, I am committed to not only giving fair and equal voice to competing perspectives, but also asking individuals to ""step into the shoes of the other"" as we consider why we might disagree.  I favor coming to the middle rather than than win-lose outcomes.","As an academic focused on American politics, I am an avid observer of politics, including of redistricting politics.  I regularly teach undergraduates on issues of American politics, including on the US Congress, and oversee students engaged in political and campaign-related internships (for all political parties and a wide range of candidates at local, state and national levels).

Although I do write many of my newspaper's editorials, they are actually the positions of the newspaper as a whole. They generally are politically centrist or slightly conservative.

Ongoing Professional certifications and training in software development and project management.","I believe that Washington was correct when he said that political parties could lead the country to despotism, and partisan gerrymandering and redistricting are a prime example of how the rights of the individual citizen can be eroded to promote the welfare of a party. I believe the key to having a functional government lies in reducing the ability of any party to twist the will of the voters and that in a proportional representational system, ensuring that the proportions are fair and equal is the first step to ensuring that the will of the electorate is maintained.  I believe that we need more people who are not members of any party, and therefore, lack a vested interest in seeing their 'team"" win. I also feel that my background in QA is something that is needed on the commission. QA requires a unique perspective where your main goal is to point out flaws without making them into personal attacks. The role of QA is to keep people honest about the state of things, not only to the customer but within the organization itself. I feel that this is a necessary function that is often overlooked when trying to build a high performing team.",I lack formal experience in participating in these groups. I have been a member of organizations like Trout Unlimited but until recently my advocacy was strictly on a personal basis.  I have spent a lot of time working with friends and acquaintances to discuss the issues and platforms I feel are important for Colorado.,,"In my daily life as a QA engineer, I spend the vast majority of my time analyzing the work of other people. I am trained to look for logical flaws in calculations. I understand that trust comes from testing and confirmation, not pretty presentation or slick graphics. I write user stories and test cases constantly, using logic and reason to analyze how any particular program or piece of data will be used. Formal logic is a large part of determining positive and negative paths for test cases. I use reason to perform root cause analysis and identify areas of regression.
I am experienced in handling large data sets, data transformations, graphing, and statistics. I am capable of taking raw data sets and writing my own queries and analysis in several different programming languages and tools. I have spent years analyzing calculations that others have written looking for flaws in logic and reason. I have previously worked with a wide variety of data type including demographic data, economic data, and medical billing data.  I am well versed in performing needs analysis, regression analysis, happy path and negative path testing, and gap analysis. 

In terms of skills, I have taken courses in formal logic, economics, business, mathematics, and philosophy. I am a certified Agile Scrum Master and Product Owner. I have taken training in Project Management and interpersonal relationships. I have experiencing leading teams of other engineers. 
Some of the projects I have worked on include: Writing a web application to handle mortgage applications, developing an HR system to track employee complaints, doing document analysis to assemble evidence for EPA criminal prosecutions, programming predictive dialing systems for customer service agents, and performing security auditing at a credit agency. I am currently employed at a DoD contractor working on network security software.","As a QA lead and release manager, I have spent the last decade working to build consensuses between various stakeholders involved in a a number of different projects. I recognize that it is important to hear and address all voices that have an interest in the outcome, but that you cannot let the perfect become the enemy of the good. Sooner or later you have to make decisions and an imperfect decision made timely is better than a perfect decision made too late. You will never fix all bugs in a piece of software, or in a redistricting map, but that doesn't mean you can't release a good or even great piece of work. I believe that the key to being a functional team is to have a strong set of core values and working towards those. As long as you have strategic alignment, individual issues become a series of small tactical compromises that allow each group to feel their voice is being heard. I would work to identify the strategic goals of the commission and apply software engineering methodology, where appropriate, to resolve the disagreements. Software development is a lot like politics, as it should be a meritocracy but in reality tends to be dominated by individuals with strong personalities. I believe the techniques I have used to achieve success dealing with programmers would translate well to building strong working relationships with other members of the commission. I am not swayed by bullying or persuasion, but focus on facts and figures. I understand how things can be wrong even if they are technically correct.",No formal involvement besides voting and independent research of the candidates and issues.,https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/363
