congressional,1725,2020-11-06T22:09:59Z,Antonio Luis Vazquez,Antonio Vazquez,Democrat,Male,m,Caucasian,True,80461,Civil Design Engineer at Marcin Engineering LLC,"I went to Douglas County High School in Castle Rock. For my first year of college, I attended the University of Oklahoma to pursue a meteorology degree. However, I moved back to Colorado and completed the bulk and last 3 years of my college education at the University of Colorado Boulder for a bachelor of science in civil engineering. 

Throughout the beginning of my career as a civil engineer, I have studied off-and-on in preparation for the professional engineering exam, which I just took on October 23rd. If I pass, I will be a licensed professional engineer and will have the ability to approve civil engineering designs under my name.","I wish to serve on the commission because I have always had a vested interest in Colorado politics and politics in general. Although I'm sure it's become apparent that I am what you would describe as a progressive liberal, I also consider myself a realist. I believe in fair, equitable elections, and I voted in favor of the ballot measures that created the position I'm now applying for. I believe our current congressional districts are fair, but as a resident of the 3rd District, I do believe they could be drawn a little better. For example, the 3rd District is widely considered to be the ""Western Slope"" district, but it leaves out a chunk of Eagle County, which is Western Slope by definition. The Western Slope alone doesn't have enough population to have its own district, so it was drawn eastward which makes sense. However, non-Western Slope areas were added (such as Lake County, San Luis Valley, etc.) before finishing out the Western Slope in Eagle County. I'm sure there are reasons for this, but it's something I've noticed, and I'd like to bring my own objective perspectives to the table, considering I have gained an extensive knowledge of Colorado geography and politics. I have always been interested in both of these things, and that is why I want to serve on the commission.",I have attended peaceful protest gatherings advocating for the Black Lives Matter movement in Leadville and Breckenridge. I have also attended a peaceful protest march in Denver advocating for believing in climate science and pushing legislation to reduce climate change. My experiences in these matters have been rather informal in nature.,"In 2016, I briefly served as the precinct captain for my voting precinct in Eagle-Vail in Eagle County. In 2020, I am part of One Leadville, which is a group of Leadville locals who advocate for transparent and fair governance and law enforcement in Leadville and Lake County.","As an engineer, I approach most things in my life with logic and an analytical mindset. My day-to-day work involves applying these things to not only the projects I work on, but my relationships with my coworkers. To throw in a personal anecdote, my partner would probably laugh at this prompt and say I'm even ""too logical"" for the job. I've always considered myself a realist and prefer to see things objectively. Through my efforts in analyzing issues, solutions can be brought up through reason. To be honest, I'm having a little difficulty explaining myself well in responding to this prompt, but I hope I have done so sufficiently. When I think about exactly how I apply logic and reason to the things in my life, I'm not sure how to explain how I do; I just do.","I know the nuances of Colorado geography and politics, and I believe these two together create a good foundation on which to build consensus regarding congressional districts. I love brainstorming ideas and coming up with alternatives, and this will help as well. As a people-pleaser, I'm confident in my ability to foster agreement between parties. The realist in me also helps to be fair and impartial. I know biases when I see them, which is why I seek out neutral news sources and take information from media outlets which are known to have a leftward slant with a grain of salt. As a left-leaning person, I believe it's important to recognize these things and approach issues with a neutral point of view. I will carry this mindset with me into my duties as a commissioner, should I be chosen.","During the 2016 primary season, I served as a precinct captain for my voting precinct in Eagle County. I took charge of running my precinct's caucus and reporting our votes to the local Democratic Party official during the caucus event. Afterward, I served as a delegate for Bernie Sanders during the first round of voting in Eagle. I also volunteered for phonebanking twice during the 2016 primary season for Bernie Sanders, calling registered voters throughout the area. I also drove to Laramie, WY one weekend to walk the streets and knock on doors to get the vote out for Bernie Sanders prior to their caucus.

In 2020, now living in Leadville, I joined a group of locals for peaceful protest gatherings on Sunday afternoons in front of the county building on Harrison Avenue. We held signs in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and other progressive causes as cars drove by, whose passengers and drivers mostly delivered honks, cheers, and smiles. 

In 2016, I donated to the Bernie Sanders campaign and again in 2020. Also in 2020, I donated money to Diane Mitsch Bush's campaign to be District 3's Congresswoman.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/1725,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/congressional/1725.html

I know what a significant impact the redistricting decisions after the 2020 census will have on the future of our state and I would be a strong but fair advocate as a democratic representative on the commission.","As a public defender, I have significant experience collecting anecdotes, records, and data, listening to various points of view, and advocating for the best outcome.  This requires collecting records and interviews, collecting state-wide judicial data, and turning that information into a compelling argument for the District Attorney and/or the Court's consideration.  This often means I consider points and arguments that I do not personally hold, but consider them for the greater good.  I am good at advocating for my position, while listening to and respecting an opposing opinion.  As a defense attorney, I believe I am uniquely qualified to work well with persons of an opposing position without getting personal and working towards a unified outcome.",I am not a member of any formal organizations or associations.,"As a lawyer, analytical skills are my expertise.  I think this is easiest to answer by explaining how I address an issue in my job.  My first step is to read the reports of a crime as alleged by the district attorney and law enforcement - essentially, hearing their argument.  Next, I discuss the allegations with my client.  If there are discrepancies or questions, I conduct investigation and research.  I often will ask for more information from the opposing side, or seek more information from my client.  I often collect collateral information about my client, the charges at issue, or sentencing ranges for the charge at issue.  Once I have collected the collateral information, that informs my position.  With that information, I will decide if we have a defense for trial or if we need to negotiate a plea agreement, and what plea agreement would be appropriate.  I then summarize my investigation and present my arguments to the District Attorney.  Often, the District Attorney and I disagree with the appropriate outcome, and we often go back and forth with counter-offers.  Sometimes, we reach an appropriate compromise and resolve with a plea agreement.  Other times, a compromise is not appropriate, and we proceed to trial.  When we do not reach a compromise, we are still professional and respectful of each other.  This is the same approach I would take on the commission.","The strongest way to promote consensus and contribute to agreement on the commission is to structure time for all parties to present their arguments and points of view and to promote constructive questioning and conversation while curtailing unproductive arguing or circular discussions.  I have very strong communication skills, and I am particularly experienced with discussing my point of view without devolving into attacks or improper arguments.  I understand the value of presenting my point of view in a detailed but concise manner, and, frankly, I know when to stop when my point has been made.  I believe I am good at helping others manage the same type of communication.  While I know I would have strong opinions on the issue of redistricting, I am used to accepting compromise and evaluating all sides of an issue.","I have voted in every election.  I often volunteer to canvas or phone bank for national and local elections.  I have donated directly to many campaigns.  In this election cycle, I only donated directly to the Amy Padden campaign.

Before moving to Colorado I was Director of a research center in Mali. My managerial background also includes being Director of the Master in Biology program at CSU Pueblo for seven years. The outside collaboration with research scientists at other institutions in US helped me approach teaching and critical thinking from a broader perspective. I chaired and/or served on several committees at CSU Pueblo, including faculty senate committees and the University Board on Diversity and Equality. I conducted several community outreach research projects, working with stakeholders and thus gaining experience about how to effectively seek and capitalize on community input. Serving professional organizations at the local, regional, national and international levels also improved my personal skills in working with people from different backgrounds and reaching agreement. 

Among others, I received the CSU Pueblo’s Award for Outstanding Scholarship, the CSU Pueblo’s Award for Outstanding Service, the CSU Pueblo’s College of STEM Outstanding faculty member Award, and was inducted into Who’s Who Among America’s Teachers for Excellence in Teaching.

While department chair and chair of various committees at Colorado State University Pueblo, I have skillfully worked with students, staff and faculty to solve complicated problems. As redistricting commissioners, it is essential that we address the following when we establish working ground rules: What is our primary function as apportioning congressional commission, a process that will impact Colorado for the next 10 years? What are the legal requirements? What are the strengths and weaknesses of current congressional maps? How do we plan to address the issues identified in order to achieve adequate representation of all the different stakeholders in our society, in a mutually respectful environment? How do we listen to one another first with an open mind before formulating our stands? How do we reasonably agree to disagree? What do we agree or disagree with, and why or why not? How do we overcome our biases (because these exist) and navigate this contentions territory? How do we productively capitalize on the expertise of staff and on data made available to the commission? How do we carefully read and analyze pertinent information, including 2020 Census data and computer modeling to reach conclusions based on data and evidence? How do we assign specific tasks to individual commissioners? How do we reach a practical compromise? Most importantly, how does the commission effectively solicit and receive public input in order for voters to actively participate in the process and help develop fair maps that are not skewed to favor a particular party or interest group, and that are best for Colorado as a whole?","Voters will not trust the redistricting commission’s work unless there is fairness and impartiality, regardless of the personal differences and various perspectives of the commissioners.

The commissioner needs to effectively examine the situation from all angles and from all people’s perspectives, even when issues become contentious, in order to reach agreement.

The state legislators and voters have provided a tremendous opportunity for Colorado to be a leader in reducing partisan fighting over congressional redistricting.  It's a historical opportunity for the state to demonstrate that its citizens can work together to minimize political discord, and with my skill set, I'd like to be a part of that process.","I have many years of experience working with diverse interests to find common ground.  I worked with the Animas River Stakeholders Group (ARSG) for 25 years to find ways to implement cleanup of abandoned mines in the Silverton area.  ARSG consisted of federal regulatory and land management agencies, state regulatory agencies, local governments, mining companies, environmental groups and interested citizens.  For the last ten years of its existence, I ran monthly ARSG meetings and coordinated all the partners involved.  The group, along with its partners, characterized approximately 140 mine sites and completed 60 mine remediation projects.  I was the co-author of a major study recommending feasible, water-quality standards for the upper Animas River Basin.  I represented the group during hearings where those standards were formally adopted by the State of Colorado.  The group had no formal voting membership and operated by consensus.

After EPA caused the Gold King Mine spill, the upper Animas River Basin was designated a Superfund site in 2016.  I initiated the formation of a Community Advisory Group (CAG) and have served as its chair since its inception.  CAG's are a formal component of the Superfund process, and ours has been recognized by EPA under CERCLA.  CAG's must represent a diverse set of local interests.  Our group includes representatives of mining, agriculture, local governments, environmental non-profits, the local health department, municipal water utilities, etc. 

I have also served on both the Colorado Water Quality Control Commission and Colorado Air Quality Control Commission and at times have chaired both commissions.  I have presided over a number of complex, contentious regulatory hearings involving a wide range of interests.  I'm quite familiar with working with state public processes including staff and attorneys. 

In addition, I have also served as a commissioner on the State of Colorado/Southern Ute Indian Tribe Environmental Commission and as the president or chair of a water authority (water utility), road association, and advisory group to our local county commission on water issues.","Nine years on the Colorado Water Quality Control Commission (three years as chair).
Six years on the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission (one year as chair).","I have strong analytical skills as evidenced by my different degrees.  For years, I've developed numerous water quality analyses comparing existing quality to standards which have been the basis for instigating cleanup of abandoned mine sites.","I have many years of experience developing consensus among diverse interests.  I listen carefully and try to understand different people's perspectives.  I treat everyone with respect and tamp down any personal attacks that may surface within a group.

Most importantly, I try to keep people on task.  I'm good at sifting through volumes of information and identifying the key questions and issues that need to be discussed and decided in order for a group or commission to move forward.

I believe I can be impartial in making decisions.  I have no political, financial, or personal stake in how the districts are ultimately drawn.  I simply want to see a transparent and fair process where the people of Colorado feel their voices have been heard.",none,https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/1322,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/congressional/1322.html

The redistricting commission’s work is critical to our democratic republic, and how it is conducted must be done with transparency, accountability and respect for all Coloradans. I believe in our state, value our communities in every corner, and believe I can bring value and experience to the redistricting commission. 

I am fairly moderate in my political views and am used to working through the passions brought by more strongly conservative or liberal views. I am experienced in interpreting complex data and skilled in asking questions that clarify particulars and gaps. I keep focused on our purpose, our commitment to our community, and how we can contribute to a process that allows all to be heard, where those with the least resources and access are sought out, that is respectful, and comes to a conclusion that works for all of Colorado.

Finally, I am a mom of three young children living in a multi-generational household in the suburbs. I was born and raised in a rural farming community that strongly formed my values, I have lived in and currently work in our state’s largest urban center. I have travelled to nearly every county and town in Colorado. The outcomes from the redistricting commission are crucial in how we value all Coloradans. I am an experienced representative of my congressional district and a committed community member. It would be an honor and a pleasure to serve Colorado in this way.","I have lived in Colorado for 20 years. I started by living in an intentional community where all residents of the program served as full-time volunteers in Denver. My experience supporting participants in programs for food assistance and basic services informed my interest in public policy and informed decisions that serve, respect, and represent all residents of our community.

In my work and leadership through Housing Justice and the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, I traveled to most cities, towns and counties in our state. I organized in faith communities to inform and equip people of faith as advocates for affordable housing and for our neighbors who need housing stability. I worked with school districts, county and city leaders across the state to inform and educate on fair housing laws, organized in rural and frontier communities to support women’s health, and communicated with as many communities and residents as possible to understand, inform and shape public policies that moved us toward better health and increased housing stability in our state.

Specifically, I have served as Chair of the Colorado Housing Investment Fund Coalition where I supported the growth of the organization from a couple dozen to more than 200 organizational supporters and hundreds of individual supporters. My role was to help facilitate constructive conversations that shaped our proposal to fund affordable housing throughout Colorado in a way that served all contexts and communities in Colorado. There were a variety of opinions, needs, economic factors, and people to serve. Many of my skills in bringing people together around common purpose, finding compromises, and articulating policies that are flexible to support needs in the variety of communities throughout Colorado were honed in this experience. I participated in community forums in gyms, county courthouses, community rec centers, schools, faith communities, nonprofits, and businesses in congressional districts across the state. This is how I discovered many of my favorite cafes, mountain passes, and county roads in Colorado. This is also how I got to know more intimately the flavors of government and economic conditions that vary from our plains, to our rural resort towns, to our ranching and mining and extraction areas, to our suburbs and urban centers.

I was in the 2009-2010 class of Leadership Jefferson County. We looked in depth at policy areas and government functions in the county. After graduating, I continued as a volunteer with the State Day Committee, where we plan and support the current class on the day they dive into State Government. These experiences have led to lasting relationships across the county and with the West Metro Chamber. 

My most similar commission experience was in serving on the State Housing Board representing Colorado’s 7th Congressional District. I served as a member, then Vice Chair, and finally Chair in my eight years and two terms on the board. We carefully considered many complex investments, regulations and rules, and complicated matters. We worked together as a diverse body with balanced political affiliation and made considered decisions and recommendations. On almost all matters we worked to consensus and hammered out to agreement. I can only remember less than a handful of votes that were split decisions. I presided over meetings and public hearings. Our environment was always respectful and collegial even when matters were complicated and passionate views were expressed.

My most recent experience was on the Advisory Committee revising the Code of Conduct for the Regional Transportation District. This committee met for several months this spring and summer and was conducted virtually. There were complexities, legalities, and a variety of opinions. I asked questions that grew insight for the body and utilized my representation as a mom living in the suburbs and traveling the system for commutes and recreation to give insights. We waded through considerations for customers and employees, as well as organizations, persons experiencing homelessness, and the community at large, and considered equity as we worked through the material. We came to compromises and worked out a unanimous recommendation that was ultimately approved by the board.","Colorado State Housing Board, appointed to represent the 7th Congressional District, Chair, Vice Chair and Member 2012-2020

It helps me dispassionately evaluate where I could learn or improve the logic of the argument, including my own. I am very capable in articulating the logic and reason I am applying to a problem.","I have been appointed by both Republican and Democratic governors to panels, boards and commissions that have served our state.

I will consistently show up and keep my commitments. I believe I was absent for only one meeting in two terms on the State Housing Board, while birthing three children and being fully employed. 

I have found being approachable, building individual relationships, and being steady and consistent have been important to building trust and creating agreement in any body. I will ask respectful questions and articulate why I support a particular approach. That said, I am persuadable and open to being shaped by the experience of my colleagues as well as the presented information. I will articulate why I found something persuasive and this transparency has contributed to consensus building in the past.

I would like to serve on the commission because I want to apply my problem-solving skills that I have refined throughout my career to public service.   I have enjoyed volunteering throughout my life, I have enjoyed taking on new challenges, and I also enjoyed collaborating with others to find solutions, and I view becoming a member of the commission as a natural extension.","When I was involved with the IEEE organization, I helped organize numerous events promoting the Electrical Engineering profession in this state and the industries that hire those professionals.  As an organization, we created networking events, presentations by guest speakers, round table discussions, and even flew to Washington, DC to help lobby for everything from improvements in energy policies to immigration – all areas that would directly or indirectly bring more clean technology jobs to Colorado.","My career  has kept me from being more involved than I desire, but I am happy to say that I was an active volunteer for 13 years for Stargate School in Thornton, CO until the spring of 2019 when my youngest son graduated from that school.

As a Stargate volunteer, I donated time to the school in a variety of capacities: I helped the school with its information technology systems, chaired their Website Committee, and most importantly, chaired their Election Committee where we organized, executed, and ratified two elections per year with over 1000 stakeholders whereby we elected board members, elected committee members, and adopted changes to the bylaws.  Volunteering for Stargate was extremely rewarding.

I am currently a member of Mosaic Lodge #184 AF&AM, in East Lake, CO, a member of the Denver Consistory, a Shriner (Shriners Children’s Hospitals), a member of the Advisory Committee of the Broomfield Chapter of DeMolay, and a former Section Chair of the Denver Section of IEEE (Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers).","My education has instilled in me a strong sense of logic and reason.  In addition, analysis, critical thinking, and ongoing education are critical skills that I continue to rely upon in my profession protecting data, keeping computers secure, defending against cyber threats, and staying one step ahead of hackers in our technology-driven word.

Throughout my career, I have been pragmatic professional where I have used my analytical skills to make the best decisions, even if the information available is not perfect.  In those cases where information is vague or contradicts itself (and that seems to happen frequently), I have used logic, reasoning, communication, collaboration, and courage to find the best solution possible.","The first and most important step promoting consensus among the commissioners is to never loose sight of the commission’s objectives and responsibilities.  

As the commission considers options for redistricting, the second step to promoting consensus is to ensure that the options for a new congressional district map are based on facts and data from the census and input from the public hearings.  

Armed with consensus on our responsibilities, equal access and understanding of the data, and education from the feedback from the public hearings; the committee will then be on a strong foundation for aligning on a congressional map that best servers Colorado.

I believe this approach will achieve consensus among the commissioners, makes the commissions’ work as fair and impartial as possible, and creates a map that is justified by facts, and not rhetoric or political whims.","I grew up in a politically active family in a small agricultural town in northern Montana.  During college, I received and political science internship with the Montana State Senate, where I supported the efforts of numerous republican senators.

congressional,839,2020-10-15T21:20:54Z,David Gray,,Democrat,Male,m,Caucasian,False,8124,I am currently retired.,"Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Political Science, Michigan State University
Masters of Public Policy, University of Michigan","I have a life long interest in government, public policy and politics.  As you can see from my resume I studied Political Science as an under graduated and received my masters degree in Public Policy.  In my first career I pursued these interests by working for a member of the US House of Representatives (William Ford, MI) and then by working on political campaigns for US House, State Senate and Governor.   
I was fortunate to work for a US House member during redistricting after the 1990 Census and witnessed first hand some of the inner workings of this process as well as seeing how critical district boundaries were in shaping the composition of future governments and ultimately influencing future public policy.    As a graduate student in Public Policy I was able to take a seminar on apportionment and redistricting and learn of some of the academic work around these subjects and some early proposals by academics to limit some of the partisan influences from the process (my favorite from the time was proposal that representatives from each political party would take turns drawing a single district boundary line on a redistricting map – the theory being that by forcing them to alternate turns each side would reduce the ability of either side to maximize the boundaries to their advantage).
I, like many of our fellow citizens (as demonstrated by the passage of the redistricting commission ballot initiative) have become concerned over the increasing bitterness in partisan politics over the last decade.  While I have strong opinions and beliefs over what is “good” policy and advocate for those positions (and the candidates who support them), I also recognize that others hold just as strongly held beliefs that differ sharply from my own.  As we have grown more polarized I have worried that our governing institutions have struggled to perform in ways that serve our common good.  I have come to agree with the position that a significant contributing factor to this polarization has been the process used to draw district boundaries for state and federal elections.  With the massive increase in availability of detailed data about the electorate (by every conceivable dimensions – age, gender, party affiliation, race, ethnicity, income, education, ……) combined the geospacial computing technology available to use this data, we really had reached the point where the party in power during redistricting can maximize their partisan advantages in unprecedented ways. While Colorado’s previous process what not nearly as bad as other states, it still led to may inequities in district boundaries that contributed to this problem.  
The creation of politically motivated boundaries lines resulted in far too many uncompetitive districts where one political party was almost assured of election. The only competitive elections in these districts where in primary elections, which often resulted in the election of candidates that take the most extreme partisan positions.
It is my strong hope that through the new redistricting commission Colorado will draw election boundaries that will result in as many competitive seats as possible, thus improving the opportunity for candidates who will have motivation to seek out solutions that represent that views of  citizens from across the political spectrum.",See answer below on how I will promote consensus,N/A - until I retired this past year I traveled around the country for work and did not have time to participate in volunteer organizations,"In my career as a health care consultant I specialized in the use of data and analytics to drive strategy development and implementation.  I was privileged to work for some of the pioneering healthcare information companies (HCIA, Sachs Group, MedStat – which were eventually purchased by IBM Watson Healthcare) and develop a strong set of technical and analytical skills to use information to drive decision making.  At IBM I led a group of PhD data scientist, health care analysts and consultants to develop data driven solutions to some of the most challenging problems in the business of healthcare.  In this role we used the same type of data (demographical, education, income, location….) and geospacial technology that are used for redistricting.   I was responsible for leading and challenging this team to turn “data” and “analytics” into actionable information and insights to drive decision making processes.  Through this work I believe I have a strong foundation in the technology, analytics and logic required to develop districts that meet the criteria for determining congressional districts.","Prior to my retirement this past year I worked as a Strategy and Business Development consultant in the Health Care sector.  I this role I would often be hired by large health care systems to work across their organizations - with Board Members, Executives, Physicians, Front Line staff, Community members…. To develop a strategic vision and implementation plan for how an organization was to achieve their strategic goals.   In this role I would have to facilitate a process to bring diverse constituencies to a consensus on a common set of goals.  At the same time I was also responsible for providing my own inputs into this process – advising senior leaders on strategic options based on my industry observations and expertise.  I believe my years of professional experience in strategy and facilitation combined with my passionate believe in the objectives of the redistricting commission will allow me to contribute to a commission that would be able to arrive at a consensus for the good of the citizens of Colorado and not for any individual position or faction.","Early in my career I worked for a member of the U.S. Congress (William Ford, D - Michigan) as well as worked on campaigns for candidates for  for U.S. Congressional, State of Michigan Senate and State of Michigan Governor;

c. I am a volunteer raptor monitor at John Martin Reservoir State Park (2006 to the present). (Raptors are predator birds–such as hawks, eagles, harriers, etc.).

As to promoting consensus: When faced with disagreeing persons–I try to find & propose different points of view–or present other possible solutions.  
For example, I was placed on a Jefferson county jury in July 1998 (a child neglect case)–and somehow elected chairman of the jury.  At first, two or three, of the jurors--went on and on–“psychoanalyzing” and blaming the mother, for everything.  I realized--that line of debate would get us nowhere–because, you can’t get inside anybody else’s head.  So I suggested that we concentrate only on the actual physical evidence–i.e. what had been presented in court, and what had happened to the children.  That seemed to concentrate everyone’s thinking.  The jury was able to reached an agreement--and return to court--in a surprising amount of time. 

b. As to being fair or impartial: As an employee, I was recruited (occasionally), to go thru job applications or to join applicant interviews.  The applications & interviews contained all sorts of inputs–a variety negative remarks--bad grammar & spelling–”don’t care” attitudes–and political statements.  I found that I needed to “wall off” the negative & extraneous inputs. Responsibilities, experience, genuine qualifications, & awards are (hopefully) left. Then, I could make reasonable choices.","1.

It was there where I learned to participate and run meetings, organize activities, and tutor younger members. That training has led to many other lifetime leadership opportunities in my community.  I have served as local chapter president and treasurer for the international PEO Sisterhood, helping young women pursue post-secondary education. In the Hand to Hand group, I've primarily provided money for specific young mothers trying to leave domestic abuse situations.

Since my children entered a parent-established/run preschool, I've been involved in supporting and fundraising for their schools, always serving a couple years, or so, as president for the parent-teacher groups. One year, I organized a group of six elementary schools to order and fund two, big canvas teepees, to enhance third- and fourth-grade history education. In public schools, I was also involved with the accountability groups, particularly for the middle school and high school. For 8 years, I served on the district accountability committee, where we oversaw the details of local education efforts. During the last 2 years, I video-recorded all of the boys soccer matches for my grandson's high school team, editing huge files of video and getting the ""film"" to their coaches.

-Colorado certified secondary social studies teacher
-60+ post-graduate/re-certification hours in secondary education","When I discovered that I would be able to apply for this redistricting commission, I was absolutely thrilled. One of the reasons for this elation is my background working in Title 1 schools. I have been a public school teacher for thirty-five years and one of the things I learned early in this profession is how important correct districting is to real people in the real world. It may seem like an abstract or incidental process, but it is absolutely essential to the correct functioning of our republic as well as fairness to the public. What I saw happening in the Title 1 schools I worked in, was that invaluable resources were being sucked into other districts through gerrymandering. This left vulnerable, at-risk students without the resources they desperately need to overcome the various and numerous obstacles that lie between them and success. Furthermore, incorrect districting leaves many with no voice in their government; politicians should not be allowed to pick the people they serve. It is absolutely critical that politicians serve the people who reside in their neighborhoods and districts as they naturally stand.
Moreover, I am extremely interested in maps, cartography, and geography - all things that are closely tied to redistricting. When I was an undergraduate at the University of Denver, I was the research assistant for Dr. John Livingston, chair of the Department of History. In this capacity I poured over maps with him as we analyzed geographic information that he needed for his scholarly writings. Eventually I was made curator of the map and slide collections for the Department of History, a job that I absolutely loved.

This love of maps has served me well in other capacities as well. As a Social Studies teacher for my entire career, geography was a cornerstone of the curricula I taught. Additionally, this propelled me to become a National Geographic certified teacher, which required a rigorous process of online learning, collaboration with a cohort of National Geographic staff and other educators, design and implementation of lesson plans, collaboration with colleagues, and creation of a capstone project. In addition to that, I was chosen by National Geographic from an international pool of applicants to attend their Summer Institute for a week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. This week entailed intense training in geographic issues, including redistricting. At the conclusion of this workshop, the participants were tasked with training other teachers on the National Geographic framework for educators. This framework includes a commitment to diversity, collaboration, helping students become active citizens, and empathy for all who share our planet. I was able to lead the middle school where I worked through this process during a day of staff development that met with great success. Although the pandemic has brought this collaboration to a temporary halt, I fully intend to continue training other teachers and helping them earn their National Geographic certification as well.

Last and perhaps most importantly, I want to give back to my community. As a recently-retired teacher, I do not want to spend the rest of my life loafing or resting on my laurels. Civic engagement is a core component of who I am and one of the primary reasons I chose to teach Social Studies, rather than any other subject, for my career. Serving as a redistricting commissioner would allow me to continue to engage in very important matters, but in a different capacity. I would be extremely honored to be considered for this position.","As a founding member of NASTAP (Native American Sacred Trees and Places), I have been heavily involved in preserving, interpreting, and educating the public about historic and archaeological sites on both public and private lands in Colorado.This group is dedicated to identifying, interpreting, and preserving important Native American cultural sites. Additionally, we have been able to collaborate with members of the Southern Ute Reservation who have helped this group interpret important sites and communicate their importance to land-owners, public land administrators and other stake-holders. Even more importantly, NASTAP has been involved in bringing Ute youth from the reservation back to their ancestral lands along the front range. I have participated in numerous capacities with these young people in roles ranging from cook to video session moderator. NASTAP holds an annual conference that includes Ute youth, and provides an all-expenses-paid trip to the conference for Ute youth and elders. Additionally, this group funds the research of Dr. James Jefferson, a Ute elder who holds a PhD in linguistics, is the president of NASTAP, and carries out field research throughout Colorado. The work of this group is extremely important to me because of my family’s dedication to preserving Ute and Comanche sites found on my mother’s ranch and also because of the importance of Native Americans to our nation’s history and culture. And, on a personal level, I have learned a tremendous amount from the Native Americans, especially the elders, who participate in the group.

Another group that I have advocated for in a variety of ways is new teachers and teacher candidates. As an experienced teacher working with a high percentage of diverse and at-risk students, I felt that I needed to pass on the knowledge I had gained throughout my career. I served in the official capacity of mentor for many years as part of the Colorado Department of Education’s licensing requirement for new teachers. I have also had seven student teachers and have helped all of them gain their Colorado teaching certificates. Helping forge new teachers involves a variety of skills, with empathy being one of the most important. For example, one of my student teachers was involved in a program through UCCS that helped former military members become teachers. This person was a Marine who had seen front-line action in Iraq, had lost several members of his unit in combat, had sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and a broken hip. Needless to say, there were days when he needed a great deal of support from me, which I was more than willing to provide. At one point he needed a break away from the rigors of teaching, and so I house-sat for him and took care of his dogs so that he could take a much-needed break. I was also able to diffuse a tricky situation with a parent who was unhappy with my student teacher simply by drawing out her empathy. Patience, collaboration, and clear communication are other skills that are very necessary for working with those just entering the teaching field.

Additionally, I brought the National Geographic Geography Bee to Skyview Middle School; this is an international competition, similar to the National Spelling Bee, which encourages students to become well-versed in geographic fundamentals and concepts. I was able to persuade the principal to foot the bill for this activity and then became the building coordinator. In this capacity I was able to help formulate teams throughout the school and oversee the implementation of the competition. At the end of the competition, one student emerges as the school winner and is then able to compete at higher levels. Being the coordinator of this project for a building of more than seventy faculty members and over 1200 students helped me use my organizational and collaboration skills. I was particularly pleased to see that I build a robust organization that continues at Skyview even though I retired at the end of last school year.

Another organization that I worked with at Skyview Middle School was Knowledge Bowl. I was the co-sponsor of this activity, which consisted of daily practices with a team of sixth-graders followed by competition at a regional event. My team placed in the top three teams at the regional finals every year that I coached them and provided an excellent opportunity for our gifted and talented students to participate in an intellectual event while developing social ties with other gifted students. Advocating for advanced students continues to be one of my passions as they are a group that is often underfunded and underserved.","As a classroom teacher, I have belonged to the National Education Association (NEA), the Colorado Education Association (CEA), the Pikes Peak Education Association (PPEA), and the Falcon Teachers Association (FTA) for thirty-five years, from 1985 to the present.  These groups advocate for public schools and public school children in a variety of different ways. I have participated with the groups by not only being a member, but by also serving on outreach committees to advocate for new teachers.

Additionally, I have been very active in 4-H, a group that provides leadership training and other skills to youngsters aged six to eighteen. As a child I was involved as a member and as an adult I have been a leader at the Kit Carson 4-H club where I was able to mentor children and young adults who were involved in the poultry and leadership programs. This meant preparing for the state and county fairs and resulted in my club bringing home many prizes including Stockman of the Year, Grand Champion, Bird of Show and many other awards. Through this process I was able to help students grow in terms self-confidence, empathy, creativity, and collaboration.

Further, I hold membership in NCHE, the National Council of History Educators. I was honored to be chosen to present at the NCHE conference in Richmond, Virginia as a representative of the Teaching American History grant (TAH). I moderated a session at this conference as well as submitted a peer-reviewed video I created on the importance of the horse to Plains Indians culture. The theme of that year’s conference was, “Recounting Emancipation: Women, Circumstance and Jazz.” This event brought together educators from throughout the United States as well as from abroad, and we were able to meet to discuss continuing the work of emancipation by building on the legacy of the past.

Additionally, the Teaching American History grant was a multiple-year program that I participated in, geared to improving the civic engagement of public school students. TAH stressed the importance of critical thinking, creativity, leadership, and collaboration in teaching School Studies, and also identified these as measures of success for students in Social Studies classes throughout Colorado. As part of this program, I was instructed by university professors, historians, authors, and other professionals. I was also able to collaborate with and learn from some of the best teachers throughout the Pikes Peak region. As a result of this program, Social Studies instruction has dramatically changed. No longer is this discipline one of rote memorization of names and dates—it is now a vibrant field dedicated to building skills including critical analysis, creativity, and civic action.","Using, developing, and fostering the use of logic, analysis, and reason, rather than emotion, is very important to me. Teaching Social Studies is, in fact, instructing students in the development of analytical skills, logic, and reason. I was one of the first teachers at Skyview Middle School to bring the use of document-based questions (DBQ’s) to the middle school. This pedagogy involves teaching students to read and analyze primary source documents and then apply that knowledge to answer open-ended questions. Unfortunately, this strategy often is limited to high school instruction, something that I was determined to end and—I am happy to report—that when I retired from Skyview Middle School, most, if not all Social Studies teachers were using this instructional strategy. So, I have had a great deal of experience in not only using logic, analytical skills, and reason, but also in teaching its use to other teachers as well as middle school students.

Additionally, I have more than ninety post-graduate recertification, college, and CDE credits. This is far beyond what is required to maintain my Colorado teaching license. I have chosen to spend a great deal of my time furthering my education, especially in the areas of critical thinking, applying logic, and problem solving. One example of this is that I have accrued many credit hours from the Bill of Rights Institute, an organization that promotes clear-headed thinking and teaching about the US Constitution. I will continue to pursue professional and personal development through continuing education classes, despite my retirement from the education field.

One of the activities that has helped me hone my analytical skills is debate. While I was in high school I was on the debate team and proudly brought home many trophies for participation in both cross- examination debate and extemporaneous speaking. When I began teaching at Sierra HIgh School, I volunteered to be the assistant debate coach. Both the participation and coaching of this logic-based activity helped me develop critical thinking skills and also the ability to see the merit in both sides of an issue. The structure of competitive debate is that all participants argue both sides of an issue, so it is important that facts and logic—rather than biases or passions—rule the day. Similarly, in extemporaneous speaking, a random issue is given to the competitor who then has twenty minutes to prepare a speech over the topic to present to judges. These issues usually relate to current events and, again, the use of logic, reason, and analytical thinking rule the day with the judges.

In short, being selected for this commission would be the culmination of much of my life’s work. My recently completed career in education, in addition to my own ever-continuing education, have given me the analytical skills, steady-handed leadership in teamwork, and ability to apply logic and reason to make me an excellent candidate for this very consequential redistricting commission. I thank you for your consideration.","Fairness is a value that is very important to me and is why I became a teacher in schools with a high percentage of at-risk, poor, and disadvantaged students. I felt that it was very important that these youth receive an excellent education, and I was determined to provide this to the best of my ability and I pursued this throughout my thirty-five year career in education. This is the same spirit that I would bring to the redistricting committee.

Additionally, I have had a great deal of experience with building consensus. With the exception of my college years, I have always lived in rural areas. This has resulted in me having quite different political views than my neighbors. However, this has also led me to being very open-minded and objective on many levels. It is impossible to live in a community and be at odds with its members, so I have learned to carefully listen to varied opinions while gently yet firmly sharing my own ideas. This process is a careful balancing act, but it results in harmonious relationships and community building.

Similarly, I have had a wealth of experience with consensus building in my job as a public school teacher. This position brings with it a variety of stakeholders from students and parents, administrators, the Board of Education, the community, and others. Navigating this labyrinth of conflicting ideas, agendas, and backgrounds has led me to understand the importance of holding true to one’s own values while also incorporating the views and ideas of others.
Pursuant to my quest for fairness and opportunity for all, I have also participated in the Educating Children of Color Conference, held at Colorado College, every year since its inception. This conference emphasizes the important role played by teachers in helping children of color obtain an excellent education, and features nationally recognized speakers and thinkers on this topic. Again, I was able to bring new ideas back to my school and other teachers at the conclusion of each of these workshops.","I have always been very involved in politics on  the local and state level. For this election cycle I have written to registered  voters encouraging them to get out and vote. Additionally, I have been involved in phone banking  to help folks formulate a plan for actually voting. I have also participated in door-to-door canvassing in Colorado Springs on weekends and after work. I find this work extremely rewarding. Additionally, I have acted as an election judge on several previous elections. Furthermore, I always attend the caucuses and have stood for a candidate at several of these. This grassroots political activity is very important to me and is, I feel, the lifeblood of our democracy. I fully intend to continue my political activity in the future.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/784,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/congressional/784.html

Now the citizens of the state have made concrete efforts to move the redistricting process out of politics and government (per se.)  I believe individuals such as myself should volunteer to take the experience, training, and leadership learned over years of making people and systems work correctly and put those skills to use making the redistricting work for the citizens, not the politicized governmental establishment.  All Colorado citizens deserve to have themselves and their neighbors properly represented in our fantastic democratic republic.  Colorado is diverse from many different perspectives - some rural some urban, some mountains - some plains, some agriculture - some energy, some business – some labor, etc.  The list goes on.  Each perspective deserves the ability to express its collective, and sometimes unique, needs, desires, & contributions, via both the federal and state representations.

Who wouldn’t want to be part of that?","In addition to the GOP County Central Committee above, I have been active in the non-profit Rocky Mountain Wing (RMW) Commemorative Air Force (CAF) serving on the Wing Staff as both Education Officer and as the Wing Newsletter Editor.  Accomplishments include implementing the CAF Rise Above program that has enabled 1,000's of Colorado Westen Slope middle school students to be exposed to and experience the dedication and determination put forth by our Greatest Generation during WWII.  I also successfully campaigned to have the Wing's Grumman TBM Avenger Torpedo Bomber certified as both a Colorado State Historical Object and a National Historic Object (airplane), one of only two that regularly continue to fly.  

Even though somewhat inactive over the past few months, over several years I have written for and maintained a small blog where I've posted many, many letters I've written to Congressmen, Senators, and state officials regarding issues current at the time.

Without question, piloting today's aircraft in ""the crowded skies"" requires logic and reasoning skills above the norm.  

Most piloting (with perhaps the exception of crop dusting)can be hours of boredom interspersed with moments of terror!  Those moments of terror require logic and reasoning skills way beyond those necessary to put together a contract for a worldwide computer packet switching network.  Operating within one environment compliments the other - I speak from experience in both cases.

Gathering known reliable and meaningful data, using demonstrated means to analyze the data for information pertinent to the problem at hand, applying the information in acceptable means, and then making sound decisions based on the data - not other outside emotionally charged input -  is the path to success - both in the cockpit and the boardroom.

Under FAA regulation responsibility for the maintenance, refueling, cargo acceptance and loading, passenger acceptance and boarding, weather, and routing of any commercial flight ultimately rests with the pilot in command.

The Broad Center - Masters in Educational Leadership, '13","As are many others, I'm concerned and often overwhelmed by all issues being politicized and partisan, and for elected officials who continually seem unwilling to compromise in a professional and communal manner. All too often members of both parties seem more concerned with solidifying their own interests and political purposes than looking out for constituents and the greater good -- this is something George Washington specifically warned us about and we're seeing come into fruition. 

Especially in a state like Colorado, where so many voters are unaffiliated, the power of parties to draw districts should be minimized or eliminated. I'm grateful that Colorado has independent commissions to do so, and I know the importance of well-drawn non-partisan districts. I'm honored to be considered for the opportunity to ensure the next 10 years are designed to serve the citizens of Colorado, not political parties.","My entire job is advocating for under-represented voices in our community -- I'm the CEO of Minds Matter Colorado, which connects driven and determined high school students from low-income families with the people, preparation, and possibilities they need to succeed in college, create their futures, and change the world. My goal is to help eradicate systemic inequity in higher education for our students, and to expand our programming to provide access to Minds Matter to every student, corner-to-corner across Colorado.

In addition I've been asked to speak at multiple conferences and summits on issues related to creativity, innovation, collaboration, diversity, equity, inclusion, and anti-racism, including the Harvard Innovation Summit, B:Civic Summit, Colorado Mentoring Summit, and the National Association of Independent Schools People of Color Conference.","I've been on the boards of the Luminary Learning Network (a collection of innovative schools within the Denver Public School district), the Civic Canopy (an organization geared towards building cultures of collaboration across the state), and the Denver Metro Chamber Leadership Foundation (an organization that serves to educate and inspire civic leaders in the Denver Metro community), as well as the Minds Matter Colorado and Minds Matter National organizations. I have also been nominated to serve on the Trust of the Rocky Mountain Vipassana Association, a volunteer-led non-profit to teach meditation techniques.

I've also volunteered with myriad organizations in various capacities, ranging from providing presentations to teachers and social entrepreneurs, to leading workshops and panels on diversity/equity/inclusion and education.","I'm an engineer by training -- my undergraduate degree is in Systems Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania and I love crunching numbers and analyzing data, drawing important conclusions to inform our work. I've studied extensive statistical analysis, econometrics, and data crunching in my undergraduate work, and feel quite comfortable drawing conclusions and crafting a narrative from data.

In addition, as the CEO of a small but rapidly growing entrepreneurial non-profit, I am perennially thinking strategically and big picture -- What is the current state? Where do we want to go? How can we get from here to there? What needs to happen in what order? I do this all rationally and logically, and lay out steps in a clear process, but with an emotional connection to the end goal, and bringing along teams of volunteers to achieve that goal.","People who know me will vouch for my willingness to engage with everyone, put judgment to the side, and have meaningful conversations with people who disagree with me. My search is for the truth, not for the upper hand. I seek common ground and shared values and vision, and I consider my ability to bring people together for a higher purpose to be one of my strong suits. 

In addition, in my past as a consultant, I have trained organizations and groups on effective collaboration, creativity, and consensus-building, so I have a great deal of background, knowledge, skills, and practical experience in building consensus and finding collaborative solutions for difficult problems.

I feel strongly that I'd be able to build consensus in contentious environments if I think the cause is powerful and important enough. This redistricting commission feels like exactly such a cause -- I think ensuring the voices of Coloradans of all beliefs, backgrounds, and communities are valued and equitably reflected in our representation is one of the highest callings in the great democratic republic that is the United States of America.","I've donated to campaigns for people that I know (Aaron Goldhamer, Lisa Cutter, Mike Johnston, Chantell Taylor) for various local and federal offices, and I've donated to Elizabeth Warren's Presidential Campaign.

Virtually all my professional engagements involve issues of business strategy, technology implications on revenue models, growth opportunities and threats to specific segments of the global telecom industry. My professional work over more than 30 years has involved analyzing trends and recommending courses of action for various participants in the telecommunications and internet ecosystems. In sum, my professional work emphasizes analysis, outcomes and ways to reach desired outcomes practically, within a definite time frame, within concrete resource and skill constraints, facing competitors with possibly superior advantages. Much of my work has centered on smaller industry ""upstarts"" and ""challengers"" who face much-larger competitors. Such firms do not have the luxury of capital or human resources available to the dominant providers, so strategic options always are limited.

Serving on the Commission would give me an opportunity to represent the interests of rural Western Colorado and at the same time different constituencies that are important to the vibrance of Colorado – ranchers, small businesses, tourist economies, the ski industry, parents and schools.  I feel my voice will be valuable to the Commission because I am a good listener, I have intellectual curiosity to learn more and I am fair and polite when working with others who do not share my values.  I did not learn English until I went to kindergarten and I am the first person in my family to attend college. I have lived in cities and now in a rural area.

I am skilled in strategic communications, coalition building and partnerships, change management, influencing public policy, training, and coaching leaders and staff to reach their optimal potential. I have developed strategic plans for non-profits and government programs like First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move initiative and the Department of Defense’s Healthy Base Initiative to improve nutrition and increase physical activity at military installations.  I have collaborated with many types of constituencies. For example, although I never served in the military, I worked with leaders at the Pentagon and local military installations in the U.S. to improve nutritional options.  Speaking three languages has also attuned me to listen and gather information about different cultures.  I am comfortable researching different issues, brainstorming, collaborating, developing budgets, analyzing options and communicating with different types of audiences.","Throughout my career, I have had to build consensus and agreement.  I have found that setting clear expectations is the first step in building consensus.  In addition, using techniques like developing SMART (specific, measurable, actionable, realistic and timebound) goals helps focus teams on what we are trying to achieve instead of personalities, tactics or disagreements. I have numerous examples of practicing empathy and collaborating with others with different opinions.  From 2000-2004, I worked in Greece for the Athens Olympic Organizing Committee setting up the International Media office and supervising media strategy and operations.  Aside from working in an environment where I was usually the only women at senior staff meetings, I managed many Greek staff with very different levels of experience and understanding of how to work in an international environment.  My way of working with them was to always be direct, honest, share information and focus on the ultimate goals.  Along the way, I taught them as many skills as I could on how to handle top level sports reporters from around the world. One of my most enduring legacies is the number of Greek staff that now serve in leadership positions in Greece, England, and Australia and how they credit me with giving them the foundation to working on teams and at a high level of expectations.  In addition, locally in Steamboat Springs, I worked on the Community Committee for Education (CC4E) which was created after a failed bond initiative. Our diverse committee spanned many different perspectives from old time rancher/bankers to restaurant owners to mothers who volunteered in the schools.  We did not come from the same perspectives, but I believe my leadership and communications skills led to a strong proposal that was presented to and supported by 28 community groups in Steamboat Springs.  Even when discussions were heated, I was always open to suggestions and ways that we could move forward as a committee.","I have worked on presidential campaigns in 1988, 1992, 1996 and 2000.

The unfairness of it can cause apathy and antipathy that lead to civic disengagement and civil unrest. For all their promise, Amendments Y and Z are not the end-all of redistricting reform, but they give Coloradans a shot at a fairer, more transparent process that can help reinforce the legitimacy of our system.

With so many factors at play, “fairness” (in terms of the final map) will be difficult to define and more difficult to achieve. But in Amendments Y and Z, the citizens of Colorado have provided a set of criteria that the commission must work to faithfully balance as they evaluate and provide feedback on proposed maps. They must also work actively to identify, understand, and accommodate communities of interest. I hope to go in clear-eyed on the challenges that come with this task and ensure that we make use of the analytical methods available as we work through this difficult, but necessary, process.","In Colorado, I've organized, represented, and advocated for the Secular Hub--a nonprofit community center for atheists, agnostics, humanists and their families. Bringing experience from volunteer leadership positions in Texas and Arizona, I co-founded the Secular Hub's Community Service Committee, organizing a team of community members to create volunteer and fundraising opportunities and to provide support for members of our community. As the Board Chair and as a POC for outreach events, I represented the organization at public events hosted at our facility and at local festivals like the People's Fair and PrideFest. As a participant in a lobby day at the U.S. Capitol, I shared my community's concerns about pending legislation with the staff for Senator Gardner and Representative DeGette.

I’ve also encouraged increased civic participation in our community by hosting debate viewing parties, a ballot measure Q&A (with an advocate and an opponent), and a Civics lesson with former State Senator Lois Court. More recently, I invited Dr. Beth Malmskog, an assistant professor of mathematics from Colorado College, to speak on how to use mathematics to assess the fairness of proposed district maps.","Secular Hub (a community for atheists, agnostics, humanists, and other nonbelievers)

- Board Member, 2016-2018
- Board Chair, 2016-2017","Early in the COVID pandemic, I actively tracked, plotted, and shared information about the spread of the disease. I derived the formula for the exponential doubling rate to track how effectively we were bending the curve and sent (unsolicited) feedback to CDPHE on discrepancies I found in their data. More recently, to answer growing skepticism and my own uncertainty about whether COVID deaths could have been overstated (conflated with other comorbidities), I sought out data on monthly deaths in the US from all causes over the last 20 years and compared them to provisional data from this year. Plotting it, I was able to convince myself and some of my skeptical friends that this year is, indeed, quite an outlier. 

An analytical approach is in my nature and it is what my internal compass compels.

When possible, I try to go straight to the source(s), using intermediaries, analysts, and pundits in a supporting role. While they all have important information to provide, they also necessarily apply their own filters in selecting, organizing, and interpreting the information they communicate. When possible, I try to identify and ask challenging questions that get at the heart of the matter; ensure that due diligence was performed; and reveal weaknesses in assumptions, methodologies, and in interpretations and results.

Both my formal education and work life (in aerospace and software engineering) have had an analytical skew. My education led me to informal studies of deductive and inductive reasoning (i.e. the reasoning of mathematical proofs and of the sciences, respectively). An interest in political discourse led to informal readings on logical fallacies, cognitive biases, and heuristics, as well as the role of non-rational processes in political persuasion. I am no mathematician, but I do have some experience with (and an interest in) statistics, which I think will come in handy for this work. A recent personality/work styles profile (that I cannot endorse, but will mention) identified “analytical” as my dominant thinking style.","In various leadership and non-leadership positions, I have experienced some of the challenges of working with people with deeply held and diverse viewpoints. Staying clear on our purpose and the constraints in which we are operating will be important to keep the team aligned. As I engage, I work to avoid letting my ego get in the way of progress and I try to focus on getting to the best solution (wherever and whoever it is coming from). Being forthright, modeling humility and open-mindedness (by demonstrating a willingness to be swayed by new information), and keeping a goal-orientation can go a long way in eliciting the same behavior from others.

Filter bubbles--political or otherwise--rarely lead their inhabitants to broad-based understanding, much less fairness. Unaffiliated committee members will play an important role in helping hold the committee accountable, provided those (unaffiliated) members can show that they are well-informed and focused on faithfully performing their duty.

As a demonstration of impartiality (or at least an interest in it), I am an intermittent attendee at local house district meetings for both the Republican and Democratic parties. I do that because we all have blindspots, and hearing facts, values, and framings from multiple perspectives can help reveal some of my own blindspots. It has also shown that while the issues that divide us are often amplified in the media and in our minds, when it comes to many of the issues that face us, we have a lot in common.","I vote and have made donations to causes friends are passionate about.  I also attend both my Republican and Democratic house district meetings.

I use this same process with team projects by asking the full group to share their ideas and knowledge so we can learn as much as possible about the problem.  The next step is to develop the solution during which time I believe the more options the better the end result will be.  If we take just the first two or three solutions we may 1) be settling to appease the group or 2) not thinking through more creative solutions.  Final decisions come down to: cost, improved efficiency,  ability to solve the majority of the problem with time provided, and understanding that the final decision might not be 100% accurate but it brings the problem closer to the solution.","As with any team project, all commissioners need to express their opinions regarding ideas put forth.

Though I am today well-educated and economically comfortable, I grew up in agrarian circumstances where I expected to be neither. As is the case for many from less fortunate childhoods, especially those plagued with violence at home, finding a better life and making life better for others cannot be disentangled. I grew up in rural circumstances in Oklahoma and Texas never expecting to attend higher education, then accepted an opportunity to study engineering Colorado. Education served as my steppingstone to a better life. I was very fortunate to arrive at Colorado School of Mines understanding the virtues of hard work and persistence. I am, thus, especially well-trained in mathematics and the sciences, and was the 21st woman graduate of Mines, with a degree in Geologic Engineering, providing unique experiences about being a member of an under-represented group. Though women were seldom hired for engineering jobs at the time, the Arab oil embargo made any engineer who could work in the petroleum industry desirous, even women. I worked in petroleum engineering (monitoring oil reservoirs and production) for 15 years: in a field office in very rural NM, in a research center in Littleton, CO, and at a regional bank in an energy lending group. In each, I was the sole woman engineer and know the isolation of being under-represented. Along the way, I completed graduate coursework in Applied Mathematics. 

I left engineering and retrained in education to address my life-long goal of making life better for others. I studied philosophy for a year to think about my goals. Since education had provided my opportunities, I decided to give back in this area. But since my worldview was narrow and specific to my circumstances, I needed to better understand the views of others unlike myself, as well as come to deeper understandings about life in a democracy and how education served democracy’s aims. I became a certified teacher of secondary mathematics in CO and earned a master’s in Math Education, then entered a doctoral program in foundations of education (the area where I could learn about education in a democracy). My goal was to become a professor and to teach on a campus educating under-served graduate students. I earned my PhD in Boulder and after a short time on the itinerant-faculty circuit landed my dream job in Detroit at Wayne State University, a Research-1 University serving Black, recent immigrant, and lower-income students. Thus, I spent the last 15 years of my work life serving these students, in particular guiding 26 of them through the doctorate and into leadership positions in their communities. Preparing new leaders is central to the aims of social justice in a democracy, which in the US has focused on equity in education, economic well-being through employment, and enfranchisement. Redistricting is part and parcel of how political structures enact long-standing ideals of our democracy, and I possess skills relevant to the Commission.

My two areas of academic expertise, research methods and social justice in education, contribute to my qualifications for the commission. My mathematical skills, background in geologic engineering, and abilities to manage both quantitative and qualitative information relate directly to the need of the Commission to understand complex data sets and their impacts on diverse people arrayed across Colorado. My expertise in social justice, my academic preparation coupled with my experiences living and working in both urban, suburban, and rural locales with socioeconomic-, racial-, ethnic-, and language-diverse people, provide me with unusual vantage points on the histories of injustice and misrepresentation in the US. These experiences also help me understand the need for justice through fair elections, and help me see not just my own needs, interests, and desires, but also seek to understand and to advocate for the needs, interests, and desires of those least likely to be included in making decisions that impact their lives. Granted I can never directly experience the discrimination felt by many in our society, but I have tried to become more knowledgeable about their circumstances. 

Fair election maps provide an avenue for ensuring that each person is included in political decision-making that influences their lives, the lives of those they care about and of those whose experiences they share. Election maps, when fair, encode our society’s promise that democracy be founded on mutual respect for one another, and on a commitment to participation that springs from thoughtful consideration of important issues impacting everyday lives. My engineering studies and career were underpinned by maps in every setting; in fact, geologic maps represent complex data displayed geographically. 

Thus, serving on the redistricting commission represents an additional way I might contribute to improving the lives of others. I seldom seek out “committee” work in my retirement, but agree to such service when my expertise is well matched to committee/commission goals. As my CV demonstrates, I have a long track record of committee work in my profession(s). In engineering work, teams of differently qualified experts and inter-corporate committees served as the primary way to share technical information and reach consensus on decisions where there were competing interests. At universities, faculty committees guide the institution. In fact, at WSU, shared decision-making was an integral part of the faculty union contract with the Administration, and faculty members took these responsibilities seriously. In addition, I served for over 12 years on the University’s Institutional Review Board. This Board protected diverse research participants’ rights (as I explain further in a subsequent section of this application).

In my community, I am active in a community chorale, a large church, and regularly contribute to food banks and serving homeless meals. I also participate in homeless services in urban settings. These activities provide insights into the wider communities where I have lived.

Thus, I am highly qualified for the task at hand, with my background in mathematics, geology (which in large part is a deeper dive into maps representing complex data displayed geographically), and in social justice scholarship, as well as by my persistent engagement in my profession with others who come from diverse circumstances. Throughout my career, I have worked primarily in settings where group (teamwork) decision-making was the norm. For myself, I have lived experiences with being poor, being hungry, and being the only person like myself in teamwork, offices, and large corporate settings.","I volunteer in online communities to help (women primarily) connect with like-minded individuals working for social justice: to engage in advocating for the rights of homeless, hungry, LGBTQI+, low-income communities’ access to clean air and water, and racial and ethnic communities under-served in especially educational settings. 

In my religious denomination, I advocate for the full inclusion of LGBTQI+ persons, and over the last 5 years have sewn over 500 rainbow stoles for church members to wear as a symbol of full inclusion.","I am active in my county party as a volunteer and in Arvadans for Progressive Action (a nonpartisan) community group devoted to social justice. In addition, I am a member of the Arvada Chorale, have sung with both the Spirituals Project (a group dedicated to preserving and teaching about Negro Spirituals) and the Denver Gay Men’s Chorus, and am a member of the Chancel Choir at my church. I attend Lukas Elementary School PTA meetings (where a grand-daughter attends) and volunteer at a community Arts Camp as a costume designer and seamstress. I was appointed to serve on the Jeffco Schools: School Safety Task Force. 

Most of my other community volunteer work is done outside of “organizations.” I am a sustaining contributor to The NOAH Project (homeless services in Detroit MI), to The Table (Arvada community food bank), and participate in meal service at The Rising and The Delores Project  (homeless food services). In addition, I sew about 250 fleece hats for the homeless annually, produce fleece blankets for homeless and lower-income families and, during the early days of the pandemic, I was able to sew (and donate) about 900 quilter’s-cotton masks for food banks, women’s shelters, and homeless food services, and for essential workers.","In both my engineering, academic career, and home life; logic, analytic skills and problem-solving have been central to my practices. Clearly, engineering and academic work overwhelmingly depend on mathematical science underpinned by logical decisions. I have for the last 50 years worked with maps and with large data sets of both quantitative and qualitative information, upon which decisions rested. As an engineer, I worked in 3 diverse settings, all of which depended on understanding how numbers represent the world around us, and how decisions I was in volved in making impact the lives of others. In the last of these I was the Senior Reservoir Engineer in a large state bank’s energy lending group, and the only engineer employed in the holding company. Here, I worked with technical and financial data to ascertain to what extent given oil production revenue streams might support loans. In fact, I held this position on Black Sunday, May 2, 1982, the day Exxon walked away from their holdings in the Piceance Basin, devastating Colorado’s Western Slope. My role at the bank required my participation in top-level meetings to ensure the bank not only met all guidelines for lending and asset management, but also supported long-time customers whose economic circumstances had changed overnight. I have also served on university-wide and college budget committees responsible for monitoring and advising administrations about budgetary matters during the recession of 2007, which was especially deep in Michigan. As happened in Colorado, significant changes in University and College operations followed, with reductions in faculty lines, shifts in enrollment, and changes in degrees and certificates offered.

In both careers, creative analysis proved central to workplace activities. All engineering decisions depend on strategic planning, optimizing production, collaboration between engineering and field staff, and creative brainstorming to find workable solutions to difficult problems. This is no less true of a faculty member’s responsibilities on a campus where the faculty are central to decisions about a College and University’s future given exigent circumstances. In both engineering and academia, industry downturns and state reductions in campus revenues created circumstances requiring mid-course corrections and restructuring, which were accomplished in academia through my budget committee service. 

Critical thinking skills are required for success in both engineering and academia. For instance, energy loans require persistent auditing to ensure they remain on track, and I was solely responsible for this aspect of a relatively large loan portfolio. I was also responsive to shifting circumstances, such as fluctuating oil prices, and monitored every loan based on its own production stream, but incorporating new information affecting all loans. To make a case attesting to each loan’s status required persistent development of case study information and data interpretation. 

My communication skills are deep. I am a widely published author of empirical research results via peer-reviewed books, chapters, journal article publications, and national and international presentations.

As my CV attests, I am a nationally and internationally recognized researcher. This means that I am not only able to design and carry out research that contributes to my field, but also that I am able to present these results in a wide range of settings and to garner the respect of peers. I am highly qualified in both quantitative (statistical) and qualitative (ethnographic) methodologies. I have taught mathematics and research methods at the college level. And as a member of the Regular Graduate Faculty, I guided 26 doctoral students as they developed and completed dissertation research plans. My research skill merited several awards and important research funding, and I served on numerous occasions as a reviewer of research proposals for the National Science Foundation, and as an advisor to BSF-funded research programs. I have given invited colloquia and workshops at Texas Tech, Virginia Tech, MIT, National Academy of Engineering (US), Royal Society of Engineering (London), Oxford University (UK), and Aalborg University (Copenhagen). 

Finally, allow me to add that I am the mother of three and the stepmother of two, and the grandmother of seven, a more diverse group cannot be imagined. Every skill applicable in my employment career has been brought to bear in my homelife career, which presented daily challenges and opportunities for creative problem-solving, to say the least.","Collaborative decision-making, and consensus building, has been central to my committee work, and used both empathy and mutual respect for others. As to empathy, in engineering I was considered a “bleeding heart,” someone who incorporated empathy into routine engineering and corporate decisions. But an example from everyday life exemplifies how empathy is a core part of my character. One dark night as I drove home to Lakewood from late classes in Boulder, I encountered a car north of Golden with its flashers on. Of course, being from the country, I stopped to render aid. A first-language Spanish-speaking family was trying to reach the Jeffco jail where a family member was being released. I gave one of the adults a ride into Golden to connect with this family member. At the jail, the family member was repeatedly rebuffed by the clerical person on duty, who said,  “What? I can’t understand you. Can’t you speak English?” The family member was speaking English and I understood her. With the family member’s permission, I stepped in, introduced myself, and repeated what they had been saying. Only then did the clerical staff act as if they understood and the jailed person was released. I was very embarrassed for Jeffco, and ashamed of my community for being so callous. It was empathy that required me to stop and empathy that led to my providing a ride into Golden. But my shame and embarrassment came from my seeming to be (albeit unwittingly) a participant in this sort of callous treatment of members of marginalized communities in our society. This experience deepened my empathy for those who suffer persistent slights and insults in our society.

As to mutual respect of others, I held a wide range of leadership positions where I treated others with respect despite differing opinions. Engineering ethics requires that engineers recognize the limits of their own expertise and respect the expertise of others, and the same holds among the professoriate. Engineers work hard to get things right, which requires gathering information of both a technical and social nature. That is, like the commission's work, engineering problem-solving routinely situates technical issues within a real-world of people with diverse interests. Engineering work routinely influences the lives of others and engineers cannot pretend otherwise, requiring that these contextualizing situations be understood from the perspective of everyday folks impacted by decisions. In addition, as a professor, I served for over 12 years on one Committee of the University’s Institutional Review Board. Committees included faculty and community members, who guaranteed that every research proposal respected the rights to informed consent of every research participant. Faculty members of the committee spanned the University Schools and Colleges, and each faculty member served because they represented one sort of academic expertise. Research participants came from Detroit MI, a very diverse urban center in the US, as well as from third-world countries around the globe. Members of this committee were trained in, and guided by, community (cultural) expectations for lower-income residents, for Black Americans, for Middle Eastern Americans from diverse national heritages, for diverse indigenous communities, for diverse sub-communities within the LGBTQI+ community, and for recent and long-term immigrants from Central and South American, Middle Eastern, Eastern European (Balkan), and south and eastern Asian countries. I thus have deep training about diverse persons, their cultural practices, and the protection of their rights. Impartiality in both engineering and academic collaborative decision-making came from requiring that stakeholders be included, that their concerns be addressed, and their advice be followed, and fairness emerged through operational structures that encouraged, instead of blunted, participation. 

Taken together my childhood roots in settings quite unlike my adult situation, my educational preparation, and my work and life experiences as an adult provide me with especially well-informed vantage points on life in the US.","My political activity has been in service to campaigns and issues that revolved around improving social justice. I have volunteered for local, regional, and state-wide campaigns where candidates’ goals and integrity matched my expectations.

For instance, a parent comes to me and says her 3 year old son cannot recognize the difference between numbers and letters and blames the teacher for lack of instruction. I know, developmentally, that children do not tend to learn these things until age 4-5. I contact the teacher to see what lessons she is presenting to the children regarding numbers and letters. She shows me how she introduces them one at a time through a game. I do some research and find that new concepts must be presented at least 500 times to children 3-5 years old before a concept gets incorporated into their brains. I sit down with both the teacher and parent and present what is happening in the classroom and what I found in my research. We all agree to move ahead with the current lessons in class and have the mother also do some number and letter learning at home so that the child can progress developmentally.","As a Director and Board Member, I understand the critical role of consensus.

I believe that every person running for office owes the voters a clear explanation of why they should be elected or re-elected.  That means creating districts that are competitive or more nearly competitive.  I think that is what the voters of Colorado voted for and why the commission exists.  I also very strongly believe in the power of cognitive diversity.  Challenges are overcome by leveraging the power of the different ways in which different people see the world, solve problems and make predictions.  Cognitive diversity is not the same as identity diversity (diversity based on race, gender, etc.), but it does correlate with it.  The challenge is to actually put cognitive diversity to work.  That's hard.  I've tried and both failed and succeeded as a VP with Boeing and with my own LLC here in Colorado.  It takes positive leadership to most effectively address problems and challenges, not directive-ship.  For example, extroverts are important to a good team (as important as introverts), but one extrovert, uncontrolled, can destroy the cognitive strength of a team.  I want to serve because I've spent well over a decade learning and understanding cognitive diversity and over fifty years as a leader, both in government and industry.  I want to help bring cognitive diversity to the challenge and to help leverage the diversity of the team.  I can be equally effective as a team member or as a team leader.","As a member of various Lafayette, Colorado, boards, committees and Councils, I have actively represented the interests of, those people that I consider pragmatists.  I take the position that it is all well and good to support lofty goals, but it is more important to support those goals that are actually achievable.  I have found that a common human failing is committing to some initiative without considering how the people involved in or affected by the initiative will actually respond to that initiative.  Human beings behave in ways that satisfy their personal goals and well being - not the ways in which councils, commissions, boards and legislatures want them to behave.  I participate in boards and commissions by encouraging my colleagues to engage in thorough discussions of the basic goal and how to achieve that goal. I don't believe in attacking or challenging the ideas of others, but I do believe in asking “why” and “how” questions to get to the very root of the idea and the potential ramifications and consequences of implementing it.  Why do we want to say/do that?  Does saying that commit us to some course of action?  If so, what?  How will we achieve such and such goal?  What are the measures that will help us understand whether or not we're making progress toward the goal?  What is the benefit to the citizens?  People are reasonable when they take the time to approach a task cognitively vs. intuitively   I believe that I am aligned with intent of the recent ballot initiative to re-draw Colorado’s legislative districts.  In redrawing Colorado’s legislative districts, it is vitally important to work from the basis that the goal is the creation of districts that are most fair to the voters in each of those districts – not to make the districts the same “size” or to ensure that they are homogeneous.  Competitive districts are fairer because candidates must actually engage voters and present their “platforms” and philosophies of government and allow the voters to choose.","Lafayette, CO Senior Advisory Board since 2018 Currently Vice Chairman

The trick, of course is to separate the facts from the junk.  As an engineer and a flight-test lead, it was imperative that I was able to conduct my own analysis and to understand the analyses of others.  That meant having a working knowledge of probability and statistics as well as an understanding of the limits of sampling and extrapolation.  It also means having an appreciation for the power of analytic theories like Bayesian probability.  While I'm certainly no expert in Bayesian probability (or statistics), I understand the concepts, can work with them, and understand (most importantly) their limitations.  

As the Boeing VP for Analysis, Modeling, Simulation and Experimentation, I led a global team of analysts and successfully applied analysis to successfully win new business.  I had to both understand the analysts and to explain their findings and recommendations to the most senior levels of the Boeing company.

I also understand from my study of behavioral economics that people are not machines and that people behave the ways in which people behave – not as some mythical monolithic bloc.","I have always strongly disliked the idea of consensus -- consensus is the answer that everyone can live with, and that's usually the “least bad” solution.  What we need to do is take ideas and proposals and leverage the cognitive diversity of the commission to build the best possible solution through a virtuous spiral of improvement.  Sounds like buzzwordism, but it isn't.  By listening to everyone's ideas AND understanding those ideas, it's not only possible but relatively painless to build good solutions.  A good redistricting solution is one under which candidates for office cannot rely on some ""base"" to get them elected, but one under which every candidate must go and listen to and understand his/her potential constituents.  They need to appreciate that they are interviewing for a job, not selling some preconceived ideas to the unwashed masses.

I'll promote the creation of agreement among the commissioners by actively listening to each commissioner's ideas and concerns, by asking questions to ensure that I do understand and then by working to leverage the best of each proposal to achieve the best possible solution rather than the “least bad” solution we can all live with.  Part of that is to help every commissioner understand the power of cognitive diversity and how the team can harness and use that diversity effectively.  

I believe that the best solutions are those that are arrived at through fact-supported processes of discussing and overcoming challenges.  I recognize that I, like all humans, am subject to biases -- biases that, once recognized, can be overcome.  Since the best solutions are achieved through the active participation of a cognitively diverse group, it is absolutely mandatory that the inputs and ideas of all members of the group be seriously considered, incorporating them when those inputs and ideas will improve the outcome.  To my mind, the outcome, in this case, should ensure that competitive voting districts will make it necessary for candidates to engage the voters and propose solid, logical platforms.  That can only be accomplished in an impartial manner.  Pushing a pre-conceived agenda on the populous is the antithesis of achieving the best outcome.","I have engaged in no political activity since November 10, 2015",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/160,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/congressional/160.html

Former USAF Instructor/Command Pilot, Civilian instructor pilot/Captain for United Airlines","I recognize the challenge and importance of fairly representing all citizens of Colorado. Recently, our state and nation has experienced notable division on numerous cultural, political and economic issues. We have a lot of challenges that our government might possibly address.  It all begins with our citizens feeling and, in fact,  being represented.  The redistricting process for congress must be interpreted as proper and reasonable.  The resulting districts are the basis for representation to our national government and the foundation of political participation.  I believe in the principle of fair representation, that I can be impartial and respectful of the rights of Colorado citizens. Serving as a member of this commission would be an honor and opportunity for worthy investment in our democracy.","As part of the Highlands Ranch Community Association (HRCA) Backcountry Planning Areas Advisory Committee, I was part of the effort to create a Community Involvement Process to represent the various interests of homeowners, developers and the community association for proposed/allowed development in Highlands Ranch open space areas.  
The final  process acknowledged the frequently competing interests of stakeholders while providing for balanced dissemination, review and comment.  This reasoned approach was tailored to work within prescribed HRCA and county structures while providing for project revision opportunities and evaluation of whether to advance to the next step in the process.  

I’ve learned that success is greatly enhanced when the group’s goals are first and foremost in mind.  Whether it’s a community or school advisory committee or planning/leading numerous mission trips to the Czech Republic, I’ve found that understanding the human, material and structural resources available and anticipating possible difficulties lead to the best organizational outcomes.  Further, establishing open and respectful communication spurs the group to accomplish its mission more creatively and efficiently.","Highlands Ranch Community Association's Backcountry Planning Areas Advisory Committee Vice Chair (2012-2016), Cherry Hills Community Church English Camp Leader/Czech Republic (2015-2019), BRAVE Church COVID-19 Response/Healthcare Worker Care Package Leader (2020)","I can’t underestimate the value of utilizing the resources and data at hand in a given situation.  Understanding what you want to accomplish and the information you have is essential to solving any problem.  For example, during my college engineering education, I came to understand if you didn’t have the correct data or the right equation for the necessary analysis, no matter what you did,  you wouldn’t really be getting anywhere.  So rather than wasting time, I discovered it was important to define the goal and go about gathering the data required.  Turns out that it’s also necessary to assess progress towards solving the problem.  Am I still headed in the right direction?  
As an airline pilot, during an airborne emergency situation, it’s imperative, also, to define the problem.  Through and training experience, I’m continually getting better at defining what the problem might be and methods on how to solve it.  I also realize that I can call on experts to provide data and recommendations to help me make the best decision.","The most important aspect of creating consensus and agreement within the commission is to keep the redistricting criteria in mind. It’s a given that there will be differing, yet reasonable, opinions on certain issues among commission members.  I think it’s important to recognize the value of other’s ideas and evaluate how that idea affects moves the commission towards the ultimate goal of creating fair and legal congressional districts.  

For example, as an airline captain, I’m tasked with making the best (safest) decision in any given situation.  Consequently, I  typically consider the given circumstances as I see them and call on the input of other personnel, whether they be a copilot, flight attendant, dispatcher or air traffic controller.  Sometimes the best decision is not the one I originally envisioned, but one that’s enhanced with the perspective of someone who might see things from a different angle. I’ve found that making the BEST decision usually involves consulting others. The best decisions typically move toward more durable and fruitful success.

I have the practiced ability to periodically step back from a discussion or situation, evaluate how the process is going, communicate my perspective and continue moving forward to accomplishing a safe flight, or in this case, the commission’s charter.","No organized political activity, donations to Dan Ward/ 2018 Virginia US House primary election and Act Blue PAC in 2020",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/1505,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/congressional/1505.html

For 46 years, my introductory graduate course in public service and public affairs began by teaching and modeling the “rules of civic engagement.” In a culture heavily influenced by rant-radio talk show hosts and ideologically charged political sound bites, people typically get little training on how to discuss policy issues on which they disagree deeply. This makes democracy less functional.

Groups are more effective when they follow the rules of civic engagement, which are:
•	No matter how much you disagree with someone, be more concerned with learning what they believe and why than with explaining or defending your own viewpoint.
•	No matter how illogical or uninformed they seem to be, do not shout them down, call them names, or tune them out by stereotyping them in your own mind.
•	If you have trouble with these two rules, repeat this mantra silently as you listen: “Is it possible that under any circumstances, some part of what they say might conceivably be true?” Repeat until they finish and ask you what you think.
•	If this mantra gives you trouble, do it while breathing through your nose, not your mouth.

After a few weeks of modeling, students unconsciously begin to use these rules themselves. The class transforms itself from a theater for eloquent bullies into an arena for civic engagement by a group of reflective, intelligent adults. Shouting, name-calling, and derogatory asides die out. Speakers get better at stating their views succinctly and supporting them effectively with expert opinions, personal experiences, data, and logic. Classmates turn toward the speaker, listen more closely, and interrupt less. They address questions and comments to each other by name. Little by little, as the dominant ones listen more and talk less, the quieter ones creep into the newly cleared conversational space. Soon, no one misses class except for work or family emergencies. This is how we learn together.

The principles of civic engagement transform lives and strengthen democracy. If selected for the Commission, these are the principles I pledge to follow.",Democratic National Campaign Committee (donated $$ in 2020).

Upon receipt of my degrees, those stones I'd laid for a career in politics, fell apart, with a blink of an eye and a mother's worst horror.  Since then, I've struggled to gain control and re-gather the stones thrown aside in the turmoil.  Today, they are set and awaiting a firm short path, in which I can best serve my community with the talents and education I've gained throughout these years.   Cause the student loans are barking at my heels, reminding me of just how much 'knowledge' I have to share.","As a CDPHE employee of 7 years assignments in the Water Quality & HazMat Divisions, both environmental offices,  always had priorities and responsibilities to serve the public sector, always representing, advocating and considering their interests.   Every effort was made to notify the public of any or all environmental or health issues that may affect their well-being or health, thru public hearings, freedom of information requests and media presentations.   During my tenure in HazMat the Department worked closely with the Attorney General's office to inform the city of Henderson and neighboring counties of the ground-water pollution contamination caused by the U.S. DOE Rocky Mountain Arsenal and Rocky Flats plant.  And studying at Georgia Tech a 100-year flood resulted in major damage to the county and neighborhood where I resided; I dedicated my Final Option paper to resolving and initiating new strategies that would not only restore the storm water ways, but add aesthetic and healthy alternatives to the community.  During the gathering o the information and data, I was also able to relate how some of the issues, new policies being initiated would affect the community, based on interviews and comments gathered.   As a private citizen, I've spent many hours volunteering in after school programs, PTA's, K-8 sports programs (always a team mom), and in Georgia became a member of the Women of the Hall, advocating for children and women issues; or on campus tutoring our foreign students.  Attending GT as a US minority student had me representing the needs of the Hispanic students, whose international enrollment was quickly growing during this 21st century but leaving behind our American counterparts and little retention or recruitment initiatives were put in place to assist them.  I worked for five years to alleviate this problem and bring a collaboration and consensus among the student and alumni groups.","Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Member, Fact Finders Inc. 2017

Whether it was for the Health Department or at Auraria campus, as a public sector employee it is our responsibility to represent our government, as best we can.  We are the citizen source/protectors/advocates that persuade the members of the community.  And if disarray is visualized or experienced, as advocates a plan is generated and supplied to counter or meet the disorganization/disagreement. Consensus is achieved by finding the middle ground, ideas that meet both or all parties needs; then working toward a mutual agreement on those outliers, merging them or redefining them, possibly allowing a better consensus. Being impartial can be difficult when it comes to meeting the demands and needs of children and the elderly, they are so vulnerable and require our steadfast and consistent support but their needs should not revoke or overshadow the needs and rights of our younger more vibrant portion of the community - our workforce.

Democracy asks that the people participate in their civic society and I celebrate the freedom that is contained in civic participation. We citizens get to come together and listen to ideas other than our own, understand that the people speaking are just as passionate as I am, that they too are participants in a democracy and by listening to them, I learn about how they come to their own conclusions. I like to do the work necessary to not only collaborate and compromise but within that energy-filled exchange of ideas, philosophies and principles, I thrive and ferret out common places where we can work to resolve our differences without attacking each other personally. I find it sad the way public discourse has dissolved into ad hominem attacks, petty jabs and purity standards that few if any can achieve. We all lose when we do not listen and talk with each other - not at each other and I would prefer to help create a win-win scenario for all involved, and while some may think that is naive, I believe in it firmly until all other options are completely exhausted.","I was actively involved in organizing for JCEA for many, many years as I really enjoy helping people understand the collective power they have as members of a democratic society.

Was also a board member of Facing History and Ourselves. Currently, I am a member of JCEA Retired.","SKILL #1: GATHER DATA 
I really believe it is very important to collect all necessary information (documents, facts, data, numbers - any information that pertains to the topic) to provide the opportunity to make a well-informed decision. As a bargainer, I had to have a wide-variety of information before me - budgetary numbers from the state and the District, survey data from teachers I represented, bargaining information about what other Districts were asking for, etc. and use all of this information to help frame a sound bargaining position and help create an ratifiable agreement. 
SKILL #2:  LISTEN 
As a member of the bargaining team, I felt it was my responsibility to listen to all members - from both ends of the spectrum. As the bargaining chair, I recall visiting a high school and listened for two hours as a few members aggressively told me what needed to be done and how I needed to bargain. I listened to them get all of their frustrations out (and I did not personalize anything). I have learned that there are many, many reasons why people will lash out at someone. Often it is out of frustration and I was simply the person nearby. When people feel they are not being honored, or appreciated, they oftentimes lash out at someone they are comfortable with. It is safe, and so I ""put up my shields"" and work to actively listen and ask more questions when I did not understand. I began to address many of their concerns and was interrupted by a teacher and as he began to challenge me, his peers asked him to quiet down. ""She listened to us for two hours so let her answer.""  As I walked out of that meeting, one of the most vocal critics walked me to my car and thanked me for coming ""to the proverbial Lion's Den."" I asked him to join our team, and he declined but got another member of his faculty to join. It was a good day!
SKILL 3: HARD ON ISSUES AND SOFT ON PEOPLE- Tough decisions must be made when I agreed to be a bargainer, to be on a hiring committee, whenever I stepped into a leadership role.  I worked with limited resources and budgets, with ideological purists in labor issues, with apathetic members who just wanted an agreement reached - but none of those issues were one person's fault. Complex problems oftentimes create complex solutions and I believe in communicating often to keep people informed, as best we can, which leads to skill #4.
SKILL #4: COMMUNICATION - Keep people as informed as you can, know your audience and respect your teams and the tasks you have been assigned.
SKILL #5: RECOGNIZE WE ARE HUMAN -Emotions and reason do not mix well and yet they both emerge when difficult topics are being worked  on. Processing information when solving problems is critically important, and I believe a process must be honored. As a member of the bargaining team, I recall hearing ""I hate this process it is tedious and takes time and why can we not just get to solving the problem."" Members from both sides of the table, would make comments like this. And whether it was because I had bargained for so many years and understood the process, and of recognizing the role time plays in creating a ratifiable document, or because I was the oldest, I counseled members about the importance of time. Good wine and cheese need time and the historian in my reminded people that the Founding Fathers worked on the Constitution for four years and still they did not have the Bill of RIghts in the document. That came a few years later after members of this new society saw what needed to be tinkered with and what truly needed to be enshrined in a document such as the US Constitution. Now, that all being said - time is not something to be used to delay, or prevent a solution from being achieved - so I manage the process as best I can ( to both honor the time needed to craft a good agreement, to allow people the time they may need to think out loud, to get frustrated, and then when we need to push through - do and get the work done. It is a balancing act that I believe in the end more accurately ensures a better agreement.
SKILL #6: Celebrate in the end the good work of the people involved and thank them for their work, time and commitment.","I operate with a single principle: difference is not synonymous with deficient. Other's opinions and values reflect a human being before me who is just as passionate as I am, and I want to know and understand (deeply) how they arrived at those conclusions. I also believe that I do not need to make others wrong in order to make me right. I have a personal anecdote I wish to share to demonstrate this philosophy. A former student Austin Ness sent me this letter in May of this year as I was retiring. Austin graduated four years ago and I asked him if it was alright to share this with you. ""Of the near endless memories I have of my time in the collective annex of WRHS with you, one that consistently springs to my mind comes from your AP Psychology course my senior year. I can’t remember why the topic came up in such a course, but during one of our discussions another student, XXXXX XXXXX, commented on what he took to be the over-reach of the “femi-nazis”. Understandably, many of the students in class had a quick and impassioned reaction to this term, and the class threatened to devolve into a shouting match. However, you were able to wrangle it back into order (well, as much control as any high school class has order). You admitted that the term had initially engendered a similar reaction in you, but that you took a deep breath and a moment to collect your thoughts and asked the student to clarify what he meant. While his further explanation left a lot to be desired, quashing that initial spark of emotion ended up allowing us to have a genuinely interesting conversation about feminism and areas it could go too far, fall short of its goals, and need to be reimagined. I remember this instance fondly, I think, because it's so out of place with our modern debate. Initial, emotional reactions are all we can muster today, partly due to the 24/7 news cycle. Nuance and understanding, even if it ends in continued disagreement, is lost to us. You and I never had this difficulty when we talked, so I’d never had the chance to see you so effectively reframe an outburst into a conversation before this. In fact, this is a skill I've seen multiple of my college professors fail to employ on the same level. To me, it’s a consistent reminder to slow my mind, take a breath, and listen to learn rather than to reply, and I think it has benefited me in many of my classes and my own learning. "" Throughout my career as an educator, I wanted all my students to know they belonged; they were entitled to their opinion (with facts cited to back them up of course) and that an open, honest discourse is necessary to maintain the health of a democratic society. I poignantly remember the days after the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 and a young man in my class proclaimed ""All of those people deserved to die. I don't feel sorry for any of them."" The class took a collective breath and my thoughts raced as the emotional outburst was surely one option, and yet I said. ""Can you please help me understand how you believe this and what led you to this conclusion?"" He explained himself - and it had to do with the events of Ruby Ridge and Waco, and by the end of the year, he apologized for his comments about Oklahoma City. That dear child was truly my teacher in helping me understand the skill of listening and asking more questions over assumptions and condemnation.","In the past five years, I have donated both time and money to national and state congressional campaigns.

I believe that our Colorado representatives should represent constituents of similar local concerns and not be far removed from many constituents located in the far reaches of a gerrymandered district.  For instance, the current CD6 map extends from Brighton to Centennial, CD 2 goes from the northern border to the southern tip of Jefferson County, and CD3 extends from Pueblo to Moffat counties.  I think we can do better. I think we can make fairer districts.  Colorado is a purple state that has had a tilt to either blue or red depending on the election in the last 25 years.  In most years, we should expect Colorado's 7 congressional districts to have a 4-3 split of major parties serving in the US House. In years, with significant sea changes or ""waves"" of one party preference, the split should be no more than 5-2. I think our founding fathers intend some degree of stability in government that is insulated from huge emotional swings as well as an inherent competitive nature.  In that light, I think we should have two reliably Republican districts, two reliably Democrat districts, one republican leaning district, one democrat leaning district and one very competitive district.

I see myself mostly as a Democrat, with some conservative social values, and a strong sense of social justice from my faith upbringing.

I have served on a large number of national and international professional committees.  I have served on a large number of committees at National Jewish Health when I worked there for 14 years, and at Children's Hospital while I worked there for 16 years, including the Medical Board.","I have served as a member and President of the Family Process Institute Board from 2009 - 2018.  I consult to them now.

Since 2016, I have been the leader of the Colorado Sunday Solidarity group, which meets monthly  (less since COVID) to discuss local and national issues.  We helped support Jason Crow's election.  We are loosely part of the Indivisible Group  led by Jody Rein in our state. 

I had been very active in St. Elizabeth's Catholic Church till about 2018, serving on the Faith Formation Committee and in the Choir.  Since then, I have followed our pastor who was transferred to Regis University and attend Catholic Mass and prayer services there.","I was an academic psychiatrist where I was also trained in clinical research and did a large amount of research throughout my career.

Without it, the will of the people becomes distorted and subject to manipulation by a few.  While I don’t always agree with election results, I can accept them if I believe that they reflect the will of the people.  However, if I believe the elections were unfairly manipulated, the legitimacy of the results comes into question.  I believe that this commission is charged with creating electoral boundaries that will permit elections that reflect the will of the people.","In Colorado, I have been on several boards of directors, and planning committees where I have developed a reputation for asking insightful questions, and challenging untested assumptions.  After the Stem High School shooting, our church decided we should investigate how to reduce isolation and help build a more resilient society beyond the church.  A “Wellness Committee” was formed and the focus was narrowed the to young adults between ages 14 and18.  I was elected to chair the subgroup focusing on developing resilience in the 16-18 year olds.  To determine what mental health issues our target population were facing, I suggested that we add members to our advisory group who were in the 16-18 year old target age range.  We then consulted with private therapists, community mental health programs, Arapahoe/Douglas County Mental health consortium, researched the literature, and searched to find what services were already being offered to address those issues.  The Wellness Committee then made recommendations to the church.  While the Corona Virus has delayed an implementation of these recommendations, preliminary efforts are being made to establish an independent nonprofit organization to implement these suggestions to provide preventive services so that the mental health issues do not develop in the first place.

The most relevant example however, was when I was on the Interim Planning Group for the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services and I chaired a potentially contentious public hearing.  I was told that a group that was upset with HRS might attempt to disrupt the meeting.  I began the meeting by explaining the purpose of the meeting, and laying the ground rules that we would only be discussing issues related to the stated purpose of the meeting.  If people had other issues they would like to discuss, HRS staff would be available at the back of the room to discuss their issues in private.  When the first member of their group began to speak about their grievances, I politely asked if their comments were related to the topic of the meeting.  They agreed that they were not, and I suggested that they discuss their concerns with the HRS staff member at the back of the room.  This process continued through a third person from their group, after which their group no longer attempted to disrupt the meeting.  As I was leaving the meeting, by chance, I met the leader of the group in the elevator, and he apologized for his group’s behavior.  I was able to develop a solution where his group felt heard, but which did not disrupt the intended purpose of the meeting.  So often people who disrupt public meetings are doing so because they do not feel heard, and know of no other way to express their grievances.","•	St Andrew United Methodist Church,

We represented a wide variety of mental health professionals in private practice, including psychologists, mental health counselors, social workers, and marriage and family therapists, each with competing interests.  I called a board retreat to discuss what interests we had in common, and what services we could offer our members that they did not get from other organizations.  The previous President thought this would be a waste of time, but I convinced her to attend.  We looked at what we were currently offering, what other organizations were offering, and what needs weren’t being met, and decided to focus on private practice needs.  As a result, our membership rapidly increased.

As an individual investor, I have been highly successful in applying logic and reason to find promising stocks, analyzing their prospects for long term growth, and assessing obstacles and trends to obtain success.  While I pay attention to several newsletters to narrow the field of stocks to investigate, those newsletters may have biases or may discount important information which I find from other sources.  That is not to say that the stock market is always logical in the short run, or that my analysis is always correct.  But my performance beats the forecasts of many professional financial analyst’s.","In my book, Don’t Carve the Turkey with a Chainsaw: Resolving Family Conflict, I discuss how “conflict is not based on reality, but on people’s interpretations of that reality.”  To understand the other person’s interpretation of reality you must listen.  However, most people only listen to the other person’s reality 1% of the time, and when they do listen, it is to attend to information that confirms their own position and discounts contrasting information.  When you are more concerned with what YOU are saying than hearing what the other person has to say, you listen only long enough to defend your own position, or find flaws in your partner’s logic.  They do likewise, and the more they defend their position, the more they believe their own propaganda.

So, what is the best way to promote consensus?
1. First present our facts and our interpretation of the facts, giving reasons. 
2. Understand the other person’s thinking using sincere questioning and listening. Good listening involves detective work that helps uncover not only the content being expressed, but also the feelings, values, motivation, and interpretations behind the content. 
3. Focus on interests, not positions. Positions are the solutions you generate to solve a problem.  Interests are the underlying reasons influencing the decision.  It is frequently much easier to develop consensus about interests than positions. Frequently, a solution can be developed that addresses common interests, and develops a position neither party had previously considered. 
4. Brainstorm win/win solutions that focus on the future, then select the best options.  When we focus on what we want to happen in the future, rather than focusing on past misdeeds, we can avoid blaming, and the defensiveness that comes with it. 
5. Implement the solution.  
6. Evaluate the outcome using independent measures.

All this requires that the people we are dealing with feel safe, knowing that they will not be attacked, or humiliated.  Judgmental comments, insults, blaming, interrupting, interrogating questioning, all-or-nothing statements, and dishonesty all annihilate safety. “Respect is like air.  If you take it away, it’s all people can think about.  The instant people perceive disrespect in a conversation, the interaction is no longer about the original purpose—it is now about defending dignity.”

I believe my ability to be fair and impartial has been demonstrated in leadership roles where I have received considerable respect as documented by the provided letters of recommendation, and experiences.

With the passage of Amendment Y in 2018, we the citizens of Colorado blazed the trail by being one of the small handful of states (perhaps one fifth)  in our country with independent redistricting committees where the will of the people can be applied without direct political pressure or fear of influence. I feel this provides the rest of the citizens a perspective of democratizing the decision making when gerrymandering is a concern across the political spectrum. 

Being a registered independent ever since I first registered to vote, I feel my perspectives of having seen so many different cultures and people of different backgrounds gives me the empathetic foundation of both the right and the left. I do not believe I ever know more than everyone else about anything, but I enjoy the learning and the ability to get diverse ideas and personalities to come together for extremely relevant common causes like this. Our state is changing just like the rest of the world, and I feel my perspectives and experience working with people around our country and world coupled with my love for Colorado, will make it easier for the committee to be  the fair representation of the citizens in achieving its mission.","I’ve been involved in several civic and community organizations since 2015. 

My primary volunteer experience since 2015 has been as the Founder, Board Chair & Executive Director of the Colorado Fine Arts Association, a 501c3 non profit founded in 2011 whose mission is to increase cultural understanding between our local communities and South Asia through arts. Over the course of the past decade my team has been able to present close to 200 events presenting our events to thousands of coloradans and people around the world to promote our mission. 

The organizing aspect of this is the effort I’ve made successfully in collaborating with the local communities and gone beyond sustaining such a niche area. Our organization is today the second largest receiver of funds from our home counties scientific and cultural facilities district. 

In addition, I have served in multiple capacities as part of various governance board committees at my local charter school for several years since 2015.

For the past 3 years, I have been serving in the Home Owners Association, currently as the President, of my community, one of the largest communities in Broomfield.

5. Founder and Chief Technology Officer of a very popular worldwide website on the arts & culture","I have been fortunate to have worked in the high tech field around various software, semiconductor, financial and professional services companies and organizations for the past 3 decades. During this time, I have applied the analytical skills to make complex organizational and technical decisions that have a direct impact on the lives of millions of people around the world.

In my community organizational experience, the challenges are similar but different. The budgets are tighter, success is measured with a different set of OKRs and KPIs, but I've tried to manage community organizations with the same analytical approach to set the clear goals, agree on the metrics of success and tracking them and continuously improving.

Having managed large set of geographically dispersed diverse people as part of my team across various cultures and languages all working towards a common mission has given me significant insights into looking at all aspects of a problem and solving them by applying analytical skills of observing, listening, researching, interpreting the options as applicable to the problem domain and validating the hypotheses before building an eventual solution.

I have in-depth technical expertise and advanced training in computational science including a popular US patent, data analytics and cognitive science. This unique combination helps me understand difficult situations better that I was able to prior to having this background and practicing this in solving several professional and community problems.","My philosophy whether in professional or personal life has been built around building consensus and ensuring that success is built on people working together. We all have unique perspectives we bring from our diverse background, but in order for any cause, community organization or our country to be successful, it is imperative that we find ways to work together under the guardrails provided for us to live in a civilized society. 

In my field of work, I deal with solving extremely challenging and complex technical problems. However, one thing I've learned is that even the most complex technical problems have an overwhelming people side to it. When faced with a situation like this, I use data as the backbone to build consensus. But, I do not believe that data alone is compelling as data can sometimes be manipulated to suit your point of view. This is where we have to find the middle ground that works reasonably well for everyone, not perfectly for a selected few.

I expect the commissioners to be truly representing the changing diverse culture of Colorado. They will be from different political, religious , gender identification, and other beliefs. It is extremely important that the eventual results are reflective of who we are. End of the day everyone irrespective of their race, education, opportunities and accomplishments want the same thing.

As a veteran teacher I had experience with organizations such as Close Up, The Educational Testing Service, The Colorado Council for Economic Education, The Colorado Geographic Alliance (COGA), and teaching Advanced Placement U.S. History, World Geography, European History and World History. I have been a reader/scorer for the College Board for over fifteen years. I have served as a reader/evaluator for the Children’s Book Council, participating on committees for the Notable Social Studies Award and the Carter G. Woodson Award. For years I have served as a local judge for the National History Day competition.","Independent Voter, I was a member of the Denver Classroom Teachers Association prior to my retirement in 2016. A member of the Colorado Geographic Alliance and the American Library Association.","In achieving my Masters in Library and Information Science from the University of Denver in 2007 I had many opportunities to apply sophisticated analysis to situations and scenarios presented as part of my course work and in my subsequent employment as a librarian. 
From developing authentic collections and embracing the needs of diverse patrons to budget considerations within unique tax districts, the focus on analyzing data enabled me to chart a clear path for providing relevant and productive library service for all.

My ability to apply logic and reason to a problem is perhaps best illustrated by my work as a reader for the College Board’s Advanced Placement United States History exam. 
As a reader, our job is to read and score (according to a pre-set rubric) student’s essays answering one topic question during a seven day session that begins each day at 8am and ends at 5pm. The same question over and over, but answered by high school students from all over the country (as well as those attending international schools). We each read hundreds of essays daily by students whose skill sets vary wildly. 
Our goal as readers is to award the students for what they know – not punish them for what they omit or get wrong. Many times logic dictates that the student answered the prompt correctly, looking at their writing holistically, and even though there might be minor errors in their writing. Reason takes that logic by the hand and reminds us as readers that the student wrote the essay in 45 minutes, under extreme pressure and without prior knowledge of the prompt. 
So when we spend the two to three minutes reading and scoring each essay we embrace that reason and logic and our goal to benefit the student’s effort is realized.","I will promote consensus by being patient in listening to all points of view expressed and by maintaining flexibility in my own opinions. I believe my career as a public school teacher has helped shape my skills in this regard. High School students share their thoughts and opinions about absolutely everything. An integral part of being a good teacher is listening to what they have to say without verbal or visual signs of judgement, and then working towards an answer, resolution or consideration. 
This skill was, and is, often tested when what is said clashes with my own ideas or realities. That is where the work gets more difficult and can be more rewarding. 
Often in committee meetings, parent conferences, as well as mentoring new teachers, the same patience and honest listening is needed. 
Especially in these challenging times, I have no doubt that building agreement with any diverse group of people will be difficult. I believe with my personal history and experience I am up to the task.","My past political activity has mostly involved teaching my high school Social Studies students about local, state, national government, civic participation and the U.S. Constitution. When applicable, I have encourage my senior students to register to vote. In line with district policy, I have always presented a non-partisan view in my teaching as well as in my professional profile. 
As a registered Independent voter I have been fortunate and honest in regarding the issues behind ballot measures and candidates, as opposed to being influenced along party lines.
I vote given every opportunity not only because it is a privilege to do so, but also because I am answerable to my students as a person of responsibility and leadership.
I have not consciously donated money to any political campaign or organization. I was a member of the teacher’s union DCTA and I withheld monies from them that were being directed politically.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/521,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/congressional/521.html

In my college years, I worked on civil rights issues.  My support of women's  equality and women's reproductive rights is demonstrated by my involvement in the effort to pass The Equal Rights Amendment and serve on the Board of Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood.  To promote women's full participation in Colorado, I was the Executive Director of The Women's Foundation of Colorado and served on the Board of the Women's Bean Project - both organizations serving low-income women on their path to self-sufficiency.

My service on the staffs of a governor, a member of the U.S. House, U.S. Senate and two presidents gave me a chance to make the lives of all Coloradans better - everyday if I did my job well, I helped open doors to services provided by my government.

I have dealt with these issues and worked to build consensus in: comparing and contrasting the observations of lawyers and non-lawyers in evaluating the way judges interact with parties in their courtrooms; helping a school district or non-profits structure sustainable budgets in times of economic unpredictability; balancing the needs of water users to develop conservation plans that allow farms to operate profitably while extending the life of precious water resources; helping stakeholders find common ground on public policy disputes so that they can both achieve an important objective and preserve the viability of affected businesses.","My first job away from our family farm was working in community journalism as a reporter, photographer, printing press operator and janitor for eight years; through that experience, I learned to be a good listener in order to use those skills and my writing ability to tell someone else's story from their own perspective.  When I served in the legislature (1999-2005), I made a habit of getting to know my colleagues in both parties because understanding what is important and special to each person was indispensable toward finding areas of commonality, especially across party lines.  During legislative committee meetings and during my service on the 2001-02 reapportionment commission, I made a point of regularly sitting with members of the opposite political party to foster informal or personal conversations that built collegiality and trust.","Precinct committeeperson for the Kit Carson County Republican Party, 2018-2020; I have donated to several state and federal candidates, mostly Republicans; I am the volunteer registered agent for a small donor committee that also donates to candidates.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/2292,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/congressional/2292.html

I believe I have the experience, judgment, and skill set to effectively collaborate with fellow commissioners, communicate with the public, and reach reasoned decisions consistently with the purpose of the commission. 

I am also a public-spirited person. Before becoming a lawyer, I served my community as a deputy sheriff, and since earning my law degree have devoted a substantial amount of time to pro bono legal services. I view membership on the commission as another opportunity to continue to serve my state and community.","Other than the few political activities described above, my only representation of, or advocacy for, ""groups, organizations, or associations in Colorado"" has been as pro bono legal counsel to the Palmer High School Gay/Straight Alliance in 2004-5 in an action against the school district seeking recognition a a school club. Otherwise, as a lawyer, my engagements have been for individuals and/or were commercial in nature.","I have not been a member of any such organizations, but I have been a supporter of, attended events to benefit, and/or done volunteer service for the Colorado Hispanic Bar Association, the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, El Sistema of Colorado, the Colorado Women's Chamber of Commerce, the Colorado Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the Denver Public Schools Foundation, Colorado Children's Hospital, the America Israel Political Action Committee, and the National History Day statewide competition. I recently volunteered to judge a writing competition sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League, though that has not started yet.","I joke that they beat the creativity out of you in law school, and while I say it tongue-in-cheek, there is still a little truth in that statement. Lawyers are trained to analyze issues in a specific, formalized way. We identify the specific issue in question, develop the relevant facts, apply them to applicable law, and reach a reasoned conclusion. This is called the ""IRAC"" method. Each step in this analysis is important. If the issue is framed too generally or too specifically or not quite on point, for example, the facts, law, and conclusion will be disconnected from the question presented. The same applies to which facts are ""relevant"" and which law is ""applicable."" After 17 years as a trial and appellate lawyer, I have learned to be precise about these kinds of decisions and analyses. 

That said, all of this analytical ability would be effectively worthless if one did not also have the ability to communicate clearly with people from all backgrounds and to ensure that the views of others are heard and that they are valued, as well. I have broad life experience: I have lived overseas, worked every kind of odd job, served in the military, been a police officer, owned a business, and been and a spouse and a parent. I believe this broad experience helps me relate to, communicate with, and understand the perspectives of a broad array of people.","I consider myself a very collaborative lawyer, even for a litigator. I have worked cooperatively with opponents to solve high-stakes commercial problems, and I have maintained good relationships with opposing counsel long after our cases concluded, which I think speaks to my collaborative approach to problem solving.

Certificate in Medical Interpreting.,"Ever since I researched the subject of redistricting and read a book about it, I became aware how important it is that every American’s vote is counted. I have found that one way to disenfranchise a voter’s right to be equally represented is through the unfair drawing of lines along the districts on a map. Example: if you have knowledge of where the minority population resides on a map and you want to keep them from winning the election, you can exert your power by redrawing the lines in a way to keep the minority from winning an election, thereby disenfranchising their right to have their voice heard.

This is what drives me to serve on the commission.  I am a Navajo Indian; I am unique and come from a population that is underserved and underrepresented.  I believe that my input from a diverse perspective is valuable because I would like to make sure people of my race and other minority population have an equal voice through fair mapping.   

My experiences in the community as Vice President of Morgan County Democrats and my background of volunteer work only enhance my drive to serve to make a difference as a member of the redistricting commission.","I can think of a lot of things as an answer to this question, but I would like to focus on my experience advocating, organizing and representing, as a member and acting as the Vice-Chairman of Morgan County Democrats in Colorado. 

When I moved to Fort Morgan, Colorado a few years ago, I found that the Democratic Party was a minority in the community.  Most residents of Fort Morgan belonged to the Republican Party.  As a result, the Democrats felt oppressed. As a leader, I found that this made it difficult for me to get things done.  

Just to place a sign out in the street was risky for fear that the signs would be vandalized. And it did happen. The signs that we placed on the street were immediately vandalized several times.  

Few people wanted to work with us because we were Democrats.  It was difficult to just locate a venue to host an event in the community.  To rent an office to hold our monthly meeting was an enormous task because organizations refused to rent to us.  

Organizing a float in the 4th of July in order to be visible in the community was unheard of.  Few members of the Morgan County Democrats wanted to even ride in the parade for fear of not only ridicule, but the possible physical harm that may come to them. Few wanted to take these risks. The first time we constructed a float, decorated it with huge banners with huge letters of MORGAN COUNTY DEMOCRATS and rode on it in the 4th of July parade, some people ran out in the streets and threw objects at us. Children sprayed water directly on us. But we survived it.  Those people in the audience, who had secretly claimed to be Democrats, were initially apprehensive to cheer and clap for us.  But I noticed that they slowly came around over the years. Each year they saw our Party in the parade, more of them came out to cheer, voicing their appreciation.  

Losing a job was a concern for the members of our organization. They did not want to deal with the repercussions of being revealed that they supported the Democratic Party at their workplace.  I experienced this myself.  I kept a low profile at work.  In this way I identified with the members’ oppressed feelings.  Some must have lost their jobs before I came on the scene.  

Election time seemed to be a stressful time.  Door-knocking was an insurmountable task. No one dared to knock on doors the first year I came to Fort Morgan.   I personally, alone, had to go knock on doors to get the vote out.  Gradually over the years, I got a few more people to muster enough courage to knock on doors with me.  What helped were the stories I wrote up about my experiences knocking on doors and I emailed these to the members of the Democratic Party in the county.  Slowly, more and more people became willing to knock on doors with me. 

With this backdrop of the circumstances, I felt that I had to advocate for who I am and on behalf of my party, not only to the community of Fort Morgan, but to the members themselves in the monthly meetings.  There was tremendous discrimination and prejudice against the Democrats in Morgan County. Everything that we valued as a party, like gay rights, women’s right to choose, immigration rights, labor rights, environmental protection values, was held against us.  

Therefore, it took a lot of courage, determination, persistence, and the energy to change the minds of the people.  This I experienced while I organized and represented the Democrats and advocated for them in their community as well as within their own party.","Throughout the summer of 2020, I volunteered by phone and internet for the Navajo Hopi Covid-19 Relief Fund, reaching out to those native people who were affected by Coronavirus. Many lived in the remote areas of the Navajo and Hopi reservations without running water or electricity. A toll-free telephone number was set up where members of their families could call and reach a virtual volunteer, like myself, who took a list of needs like food, water, medical, transportation and cleaning supplies and passed this list on to the ground volunteers who supplied these needs. This was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.  

Since 2015, I have also volunteered for other events like the Thanksgiving dinner for the homeless at the Rise Up Center through the Community of Christ church.

I have participated in the weekly bible study through the Lutheran Church of Our Redeemer.
I have also participated in a different bi-weekly men’s bible study in the Fort Morgan community which included various religious groups.

When a borrower comes to me for financing, I am required to use all these skills to determine if the borrower will be capable of repaying the money he hopes to obtain.  As the loan officer or mortgage broker, I am the first gatekeeper towards the borrower’s path to obtaining a loan. After analyzing the borrower’s liabilities and assets, I have a duty to make a wise judgment as to whether the loan will close.  This involves gathering data to reveal the picture of the borrower.  I am obligated to input the data accurately into my calculations and verify that the borrower has sufficient income, stable job history, and sufficient reserves to sustain the monthly payment.  I have to determine whether the borrower has the appropriate debt ratio, which is the amount of debt analyzed against the income.  Investigating, verifying, and checking for accuracy are all part of forming the true picture of the borrower. If there are blemishes in the credit history of the borrower, I have the responsibility to determine how the negative credit will impact the borrower’s ability to repay the loan.  Here, my ability to communicate is essential; I am required to draw the information from the borrower to determine if the bad credit is due to consistent negligence or a one-time event that was beyond the control of the borrower. 

When the case is extremely difficult, I am forced to collaborate with my fellow-loan officers and supervisor to see if the deal is too risky or if we can creatively do the financing. An example is if the property falls within a fine-line definition of real property. Real property is one that is affixed to land.  As a mortgage lender, the only properties I can finance are those that fall within this definition of real property. A questionable type of this property is a modular home which used to be a movable property but has since been transformed into a property that would be attached to land. The investors who ultimately put up the money to finance the deal may bring up this question at the last minute of closing and the property could be rejected. A good loan officer has this foresight and avoids this probability beforehand.  

Being at the forefront where everything hinges on how well I reveal the true picture of the borrower is the essential part of whether the investor will profit or lose money on the deal of financing a borrower’s request.  How well I have used my analytical skills and how well I have applied my logic and reasoning to solve the initial problems involved in approving a loan will determine the end result of the investment.","As president of a Native American organization, I had a rare opportunity to lead a people that came from two diverse religious beliefs.  One group was of the Christian faith and this group consisted of urban Indians coming from the city lifestyle.  The other group was of the traditional Native American religion which came in from the reservation areas.   I was tempted to cater to one group which had similar beliefs to mine.  But I had to overlook my established way of thinking and become empathetic to those who believed differently than me.  I also noticed that it was easy for one group to turn against the other because they felt, albeit unsubstantiated, there was favoritism demonstrated against them. An example of the diverse of beliefs was how they felt about gay members of the group.  The Christians did not feel that assistance should easily be given to the gay members of the group while the traditional natives had more compassion and respect for the gay members. Though it was a challenge, I had to be fair and impartial. I brought these groups together by promoting consensus by first allowing the members to introduce themselves and to share something unique about themselves.  An important characteristic about the gay members was that they were very artistic.  Most had a talent to perform or to decorate.  This came in very handy when we decided to build a float for an annual parade that had a historical significance to the Native American community.  Our float was featured on television because we brought Native American dancers together to perform on the float.  The Native American motif and design was unique and outstanding.  What resulted from this event was the new respect the gay members gained.  There was a better understanding between the groups and a respect for their diverse uniqueness of the members.  The conservative group became more empathetic to the gay group as well as the traditional native group.  They all started to get along and a much better cohesiveness was created.  As a result, the ability to collaborate on new projects were more easily achieved.

From experiences like this, I feel that I can contribute to the redistricting commission by listening to the different perspectives and points of view, thereby be impartial and  promote consensus among the commissioners.","Most of my past political activity has been with the Morgan County Democratic Party.  I led the way to knocking on doors for the Hillary Clinton campaign.  I made calls to voters.  I spent all day on election day contacting those voters who had not yet voted and following up on those who had not responded by visiting their homes in order to make sure that every voter had voted.  I would like to think that due to my efforts, I have contributed to the victory of Hillary Clinton in the state of Colorado.  

Before the Hillary Clinton elections, I helped Barack Obama win Colorado.  I was fortunate to win the Northeastern CO campaign for the volunteer who had gone the extra mile of knocking on doors and calling on voters.  The winner would have his picture taken with Vice President Joe Biden.  I was so excited to meet and pose in a photo with VP Joe Biden. 

I have been very active with the Morgan County Democratic Party ever since I came to Fort Morgan 14 years ago.  I volunteered to head committees to organize dinners, like our annual Big-Ten dinner, as well as the fall and Christmas dinners.  The task of organizing and planning involved a wide range of tasks.  We had to find a proper venue equipped with a kitchen and a facility to hold enough people for the event.  If the event was a potluck dinner, we had to make sure people brought enough food.   We had to come up with a theme and design an agenda.  We had to solicit help to decorate the venue and clean up the location.  Places that had no sound system was an extra task to find someone to provide a sound system.  Providing entertainment for the dinner involved the task of soliciting musical groups to perform at the event.  In order to run an event according to schedule, it was important to follow up with the speakers and presenters to make sure they had all the information they needed so they could arrive on time.  Finally, one of the most important part of organizing an event was to plan a fund-raising project, like an auction during the dinner, that would be lucrative for the Party. 

Community exposure was one of my objectives as a leader.  I wanted the public to know who we were and what we stood for.  I wanted to make the public feel welcome to our center.  With that in mind, I reached out by introducing myself and the Party whenever events came about in the community.  I made small presentations about our monthly meetings, our frequent get-togethers including dinners and parties and made the public feel at ease with us and helped them realize that we had a lot of positive things to offer.  

I donated $35 dollar every year for the Big-Ten dinners since 2015.  I also donated $30 each to 3 candidates since that time.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/1017,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/congressional/1017.html

BIS, University of Minnesota, in philosophy, political science, education policy.","I think there are far too few competitive districts--at both the state and federal level. Such safe districts erode democratic accountability, and often end up in legislators who are not asked to represent diverse, and divergent, viewpoints. I wonder if this situation also undermines the possibilities for political compromise and action. At the same time, I understand that districts also need to represent certain minoritized communities who may be under-represented in general or at-large elections. So, in a sense, I see the complexity of the issues, and hope to help consider these various viewpoints.","Before becoming a professor, I worked with several school and community organizations, including in new immigrant communities, working to create reciprocal and respectful partnerships between universities and communities. I do work collaboratively with a range of parents, district officials and other constituents on our district's DAC (district accountability committee). I've chaired the Data and Assessment committee, and played a lead role on the Charter School Application review committee, which often involved negotiating difficult--and vocal--constituencies on the committee, and those advocating various positions. Our committee had to craft careful, fair evaluation reports that could be understood and accepted by advocates both for--and against--expanding charter schools, and also ones that would hold up to subsequent review and appeal.","I am mostly active in my local school district (serving on the BVSD DAC), and local school (University Hill Elementary). I also served on a state-wide commission to evaluate accountability measures for Alternative Education Campuses (AECs). Through my work and research at CU, I've organized a number of outreach events to help communities better understand--and deliberate about--standards, accountability and assessment. I'm committed to working across political lines to build opportunities for dialogue. I've worked both on the Front Range and also in NE Colorado to hold community forums and smaller school-based dialogues.","I am trained as a philosopher, and enjoy thinking through the various reasons, criteria or values at play in discussions. For instance, what principles or values might shape or guide redistricting choices? How might these principles be applied, fairly, and with an eye to their consequences, and the perhaps disparate consequences for differently situated groups? I also like careful and analytic writing, from meeting notes to final reports (sometimes an under-rated part of committee work!).","I am a Democrat, but grew up in a small town with many different political allegiances. I believe that I have a strong ability to hear--and empathize--with other viewpoints. As a faculty member, I have participated on many standing and ad-hoc committees, and often find ways to listen to different viewpoints, forge consensus, and move groups forward productively.

Accurate representation which is focused on solving our most pressing concerns as local communities, while advocating for those communities when solving the concerns of broader shared communities is how our representative democracy works most effectively. The only way to achieve that pillar of our us government is to make sure the resulting representatives most accurately represent the opinions of the voters. This needs to hold true whether their opinions are based on profession, age, ethics, ethnicity, faith, culture, interest or any other trait or belief. I want to help find a districting solution that makes sure the biggest stresses of the most Coloradans are the primary concerns of the our representatives while not suppressing the most critical issues of the minority groups. I want to help make sure every unique minority facet of our beautiful state can see themselves reflected in the advocacy of their representatives.
More personally, I’m 29 years old with a unique skillset with a background in gis and data communication.

A recent example of success I have had organizing my community would be solving a storm water drainage issue in my neighborhood. I worked with my neighbors to define the problems causing water to pool in our yards, worked with civil engineers and contractors to develop a solution using chase drains.  Then worked stakeholders like my neighbors, the town of Frederick public works, and our metro district to execute that solution while following requirements like permitting, the drainage plan and funding. The metro district then expanded that solution to other drainage issues in our subdivision.",National Hemophilia Society colorado chapter,"I have worked for the USGS (DOI), IBM and Maxar (formerly DigitalGlobe) working as a software developer on several missions in a variety of industries aerospace, meteorology, natural disasters, and shipping logistics.  All of which involve logic and reasoned problem solving with complex GIS data.  I daily: define problems, collect (physical, digital, legal, and financial) requirements, design solutions, communicate those solutions to clients, and implement those solutions.
For example, when I worked for the United States Geologic Service a division in the Department of the Interior in college for 5 years; made earthquake risk maps. These maps are provided to first responders within 15 minutes of an earthquake to best make decisions about where victims meed help and what help they will need. I also made earthquake hazard maps for legislators and policy makers to use when designing building codes. I frequently worked with audiences like first responders and government officials to explain natural disaster risk and refine the information I provided to best serve the common goal of keeping people safe in the most extreme disasters.","I can reach a consensus for two reasons: Im an political independent use to finding common ground with both parties, and I am good at communicating complex data driven solutions particularly with maps.
I believe the most stark differences in our political beliefs is not our political party, despite our representatives voting on party lines the majority of the time. When I talk with my diverse neighbors about how legislation would impact them in a way divorced from party and focused on their family, I find the divisions much more tied to their professions, faith, and interests. When I became an independent, it was to find candidates from both parties that shared my opinions and focus for political issues that impacted me. I think I can convince people from both parties of the real contrasts in our communities rather than focus on party and how best to make every diverse voice be represented.
Additionally, I have worked on map and data presentation design to lay out non-partisan intents and draw a solution in a simple and understandable way.

This provided a framework for identifying root causes and differentiating them from symptoms. By serving on a variety of committees I gained experience in working with people with both similar and opposing interests to achieve consensus. Where there is a team of people working to achieve an agreed upon objective, one must make sure the objective is understood and if there are any reservations, the reservations are identified, discussed and resolved or the objective will not be readily achieved. This process takes logic and reason and familiarity with conflict resolution tools. Additionally, if data are to be analyzed, knowledge of techniques such as data mining may be necessary in order to process the census data appropriately. I have experience in applying data analysis techniques including pattern recognition, machine learning, and neural networks.","I will promote consensus by listening and using skills acquired from my education, experience in leading meetings, serving on many public and private committees and employing conflict resolution methods gained through certified 
conflict resolution practices.

I have learned that fair and impartial decisions are requirements in gaining trust and commitments to achieving results. This has also worked most of the time in dealing with my children.","I have made small donations, from $25 to $50, to a number of candidates.

There are many who don’t feel heard when they raise concerns.  Where I live, in Longmont, I know that the chances of electing a person to the Federal House of Representatives who reflects my community are almost nil.  
It is crucial that our political landscape become more about representing people and the local/ regional aspects of the communities where we live. My hope is that by serving on the committee, I can advocate for a fair map where everyone can know that their voice will be heard when voting.  A map that realizes the dream of equal representation, without favoring parties or special interests, while also acknowledges areas of our communities have special circumstances, such as race and economic status that must be reflected in the maps. I continue to hope for a return to civility in politics where we listen to and learn from each other.","I am a long time environmental advocate.  Now that I am retired I have time to become personally engaged by working on issues important to me.  I bring my skills that include close to 40 years in management to this work. I am able to bring strategic decision making, collaboration, planning and financial ability to the organizations I work with.
Building support for sustainaibility throughout our community is vital to the work that Sustainable Resilient Longmont (SRL) undertakes. SRL engages residents across the community, including  youth and people of color in events such as earth day.  SRL Earth day is a focus on children and how they interact with the earth.  In 2020, the event moved on line with youth from local high schools discussing what climate change means in their lives. 
Another important aspect in community/ grassroots activism is working with city government.  I know all of the city council members personally.  I frequently speak at council meetings to advocate for environmental issues.  This relationship was a key element in achieving a Longmont Resolution to commit to 100% renewable energy by 2030.","Climate Reality, trained climate leader

Coloradans Resisting Extreme Energy Development","My success in Nursing Administration was based on my ability to analyze issues and apply data to arrive at a solution. I will relate a quality improvement project in my last position.  There were three ICU’s.  A QI project to reduce ventilator associated pneumonia was very successful in 2 of the 3.  The third, the Neuro Trauma ICU, was difficult, but knowing that there had to be a reason, a team explored the differences.  We discovered that patients who had head trauma were being transported daily for head CT scans.  The transport was putting them at risk and we were able to define some simple steps to prevent this complication.  
I apply the same type of skills to my activist work. When planning educational events about topics, such as renewable energy, exploring data and research studies informs how we plan events. Reading through online records of meetings and attending board meetings at Platte River Power Authority gives me the ability to discuss electricity generation with our city council and to speak with other community members.","As I look at the current political landscape, I see so much division. I grew up in rural Nebraska.  I know and love many folks who are conservative.  I am not afraid to reach out to those who do not share my political views.  In my work in Nursing Administration, being able to build relationships with people in other divisions was paramount to the success in my area of responsibility.  Also, working on projects that involved caregivers on several shifts, in several units on two campuses,  required skills in building consensus.  To bring in physician acceptance required negotiating skills.  I use these skills of negotiating, relationship and consensus building, plus willingness to work with people of diverse backgrounds to my activism work.  I also bring the nursing art and skill of empathy.  Stepping back to see the people behind decisions and how they are affected is needed in any work.
My work with SRL provides an example of how I can apply these skills. Acceptance of the possibility of renewable energy is difficult for many people.  Acknowledging that jobs in the fossil fuel industry will be lost, then discussing the potential of jobs in renewable energy requires listening first instead of arguing. This usually leads to a good conversation while planting seeds that may change minds.","Being involved in our democracy is important to me.  My involvement includes donations to candidates at all levels of our government, working with organizations to promote candidates, and personal engagement such as door to door campaigning. 
Locally I work with a grassroots group that delivers candidate information to residents in Longmont.  Through my local Sierra Club group in Boulder County, I work on candidate endorsements based on environmental priorities.  Also, I am on the board of Sustainable Resilient Longmont.  This organization holds candidate forums where candidates are asked questions about sustainability. 

This election season, I determined that I needed to engage in the Presidential Election.  I wrote letters, texted and made phone calls to battleground states through  Sierra Club Independent Action.

In this process logic both deductive and inductive is a deeply ingrained part of our process.  All arguments or claims must be based on sound premises that themselves are supported by data.  In addition to this the claim made needs to have data that answers or specifically supports that claim.  Often our data answers a question that is different than what we are asking.  In this case we must always follow the data to determine what it is revealing.  We need to do this always in an intellectually honest way, by acknowledging our biases and then controlling for them so that they do not taint our conclusions.

I am convinced that serving on this commission is the most consequential way I can make a difference for fair voting in our state.

During my time at CDC, I was routinely called upon for special assignments – establishing high-profile programs, leading rapid decision-making units during pandemics, rescuing and rehabilitating programs decimated by political budget cuts.  After retirement, I committed to myself that I would use those skills and that passion to help find solutions in my own community and state, rather than just at the Federal government level.  

I have long been interested in Congressional processes. During my time at CDC, I had the privilege to meet regularly with members of Congress and their staffs to educate them about our programs and answer their questions.  I love the idea of democratic representation and finding ways to make that representation really work.  Spending the bulk of my career living in a state that was heavily gerrymandered (Georgia) was exceptionally frustrating and something I vowed to take seriously when I was free of the Hatch Act restrictions I was placed under as a Federal uniformed services officer.  

When I retired and moved to Colorado in 2016, I knew I was moving to a state with many fewer Congressional districts, and that the population size and distribution was the largest determinant of how those districts are structured. The degrees of freedom for creating districts are extremely limited because of this. But the issues facing voters in CO-3 – one of the largest geographical districts in the nation with a relatively small population – must be considered and forcefully advocated for during the redistricting analysis and decision-making.  I want to represent that perspective while also recognizing that the commission must make the best decisions for the good of the entire state.  I want to apply my analytic, strategic, and negotiation skills to this big, difficult challenge to help the commission succeed in its work.","Upon moving to Colorado, I became an active member of 4 volunteer music organizations – the Cowboy Corral, Symphony in the Valley, the Aspen Choral Society, and High Country Sinfonia. In each, my goal was to serve as an outstanding musical contributor. With Aspen Choral Society and High Country Sinfonia, I quickly became more deeply involved in the organizational and business aspects through appointments to the Boards of Directors.

I joined the Board of the Aspen Choral Society at a time when many important organizational changes were occurring. I quickly recognized that the Board would benefit from having the bylaws updated and a more aggressive public relations and fundraising posture.  I led the revision of the bylaws, facilitated the entire board in reviewing and discussing options for important changes, identified a volunteer to serve as our general counsel for review and advice, and assisted the Board President with socializing and approving the new bylaws among the full board. I also worked closely with a public relations contractor to develop press releases and a more active social media presence. Behind the scenes, I provide guidance to the Board President based on my previous experience and training as a member of a board for a large national organization. 

High Country Sinfonia appointed me to their Board in 2020 to assist with their efforts to become a registered non-profit organization in the state of Colorado. That work is ongoing and draws from my experience developing the bylaws and procedures for Aspen Choral Society.

My approach to organizing, representing, and advocating for both organizations is to serve the three “duties” of a board member – duty of care, duty of loyalty, and duty of obedience. My aim is to improve their business operations through careful shifts in policy and activity, while honoring the long local traditions of each organization and the deep relationships among and between the long-standing members, board members, and the community members who are our donors and audiences.

A second way I actively consider the interests of Colorado organizations is my professional consulting work in public health and strategic planning. I have worked with several governmental organizations or associated entities within Pitkin County including the Board of County Commissioners, the Department of Public Health, the Aspen Pitkin County Housing Authority, and the Pitkin County Elected Officials Transportation Committee (including the Pitkin BoCC, the Aspen City Council, and the Snowmass Village Town Council). In each engagement, I have strived to build rapport, guide the group to a strategic solution, and identify and resolve areas of disagreement all while adhering to the parameters provided by the sponsor/client.  This work has given me deep insight into the political structures, realities, and foibles of the government entities within one county and, critically, how those entities relate to their neighboring counties of the Roaring Fork Valley.","•	American College of Preventive Medicine (a 501c3 national professional medical society, member since 1996; Fellow since 2004; Board of Regents President-Elect 2017-2019, President 2019-2021, CEO Search/Selection Committee Chair 2018)

I have an extensive background in conducting analytic studies documented by my publication record (see CV).  As a supervisor and manager, I was also responsible for reviewing and approving analytic studies using numerous statistical data sets (including census data).  In approaching problems of all kinds, I first look to the available data, seek other sources of information, and apply the strategic negotiation and planning skills described above to best analyze, generate options, and solve a problem.","In my facilitation and strategic planning work, I use several techniques to promote consensus.  Chief among these is to ask questions to make sure I fully understand the perspective and contribution of the group members. I also make sure that I carefully draw out both the explicit and implicit criteria people are using to make decisions so that I can find areas where negotiation is possible.  I always try to understand my own and others’ self-interests.

I also work to reframe conflicts – what is it we already agree on?  How can we use those points of agreement to find solutions to meet the enlarged interests of the group – in this case the entire state?  When disagreement continues it is usually because the “right” solution has yet to be found. Being creative and drawing on the entire group’s creativity is key. And finally, I aim to always articulate how the group came to its recommendation or solution and what the criteria were. This contributes directly to communications that generate buy-in among stakeholders and so that each member of the commission can faithfully and enthusiastically promote the results of the work.

My training as a scientist, manager and leader and my experience in the highly politicized environment of Federal public health instilled in me the need for fairness and impartiality. One cannot lead a team without being fair. Serving as the steward of a Federal budget requires one to be impartial.  Federal procurement rules build fairness and impartiality directly into the systems within which I was trained. It is my instinct – through disposition and training – to make decisions based on facts, after considering the pros and cons of all the options, while making the decision criteria explicit, and with a deep understanding of how all stakeholders will feel about the decision.

Finally, the most important aspect of promoting consensus and contributing to a fair, impartial and agreeable process is getting to know and appreciate the perspectives of my fellow commissioners. Learning about each other – including who we are and what we value – will be key to the commission’s success.","During a 25-year career as a Federal uniformed services medical officer (1991-2016), my political activity was limited due to Hatch Act restrictions.  Following my retirement (September 1, 2016), I participated in house-to-house canvassing during the 2016 general election.  During the 2018 election, I did a small amount of letter writing for the Diane Mitsch Bush campaign (CO-3).  

During 2020, I have participated in the Eagle County Democratic Caucus and as a district/state delegate in March, served as an Eagle County citizen election judge during the June primary, and briefly volunteered for and participated in one meeting of the Eagle County Democrats this summer. Because of ongoing public health consulting work related to the pandemic, I have not been able to continue my volunteer activities at this time. As I wind down these consulting activities, I plan to serve as a citizen election judge again for the general election in November.

While we did have our share of disagreements, at the end of the process we had a plan that worked and that the participants in the process were proud of. I also worked hard to try to build consensus around a new Congressional District map (at that time, crafted by the legislature). While we came close, partisan interests prevailed and litigation ensued, resulting in a map drawn by a federal court judge. I was also in the Senate when Republican leadership attempted to re-draw the map ""out of cycle"" when they controlled both houses of the legislature. That was a low mark of my legislative career when I was unable to convince my Republican friends of the danger to the institution their midnight gerrymander represented.","I have been a registered Democrat in Colorado since 1986.

BS in Mechanical Engineering, MIT","I think, like many Coloradans, I have become concerned about the polarization of political discourse in our country.  I became interested in the redistricting process after stumbling across a monograph by Professor Robert Loevy who participated in the 2010 effort in Colorado.  That spurred me to read ""RatF**ked"" by David Daley.  Clearly, redistricting is a complex process involving multiple competing priorities.  That type of problem is one with which I have a great deal of expertise.  I have specialized expertise in data analysis and the design decision support systems.  My research is focused on problems involving temporal and geo-spatial uncertainty.  I believe I have a lot to offer the Colorado redistricting effort: I have the time, the interest, and the expertise.  I think I also have the right demeanor  -- I am an idealist but not a zealot.  When facing conflict, I seek out a solution having the most good for the most stakeholders.  In summary, I want to serve because I think I can add value to the process, and because I believe that a successful redistricting process in Colorado might serve as a positive model for our country.","As a faculty member at CSU, I deliberately avoided participation in special interest groups.  I believe that by maintaining neutrality on political and social issues, I fostered an atmosphere with my students that promoted free exchange and critical thinking.  So rather than directing my energies to causes that I admire, I have directed my service directly to my students.  For example, using my uncompensated personal time to coach students for international competitions.","I have served as an officer in each of the HOAs of which I have been a member for the last 20 years, most recently as the President of the Miner's Lake HOA.","I am a decision scientist by training.  I have spent more than 30 years conducting research into decision scenarios that are characterized by high stakes, time pressure, and uncertainty.  My earlier work involved the study of decision making in teams and small groups, and so I am an expert in processes used to form consensus in heterogeneous groups.  More recently, I have been investigating biases in judgment and perception related to geo-spatial reasoning -- for example, estimating the location of landfall for a hurricane, or the best location to search for an aircraft lost at sea.  The process of redistricting involves many of these same geo-spatial biases.  My research has been funded by several federal agencies, most notably the Office of Naval Research.  I am especially skilled at transforming the findings of my research into practical guidance for sailors and Marines.  I look forward to bringing these same capabilities to bear on the Colorado redistricting effort on behalf of all the citizens of our state.","I think the key to resolving conflict will be to discover the shared values among the stakeholders.  This requires the ability to listen and have empathy.  Those are skills I possess.  Not all values are shared, and in that case, it is important to understand the relative importance of the goals for each stakeholder.  The process of promoting consensus involves finding ways to promote the shared values while also trading-off on the relatively less-important unshared values.  I have a lot of experience with this sort of small-group decision process via many years of faculty meetings and neighborhood meetings.  Obviously, the stakes in those examples are much lower, but the process is the same: how do you reach agreement without creating animosity among people you work with or live near?  In the case of redistricting, I think I am aided because I don't identify with any political party, so I don't view the process through the lens of winning and losing.  Rather I think I can be fair and impartial while working towards the shared goal of finding the best district boundaries that achieve the priorities of the Reapportionment Amendment and the Hobbs decision.","I have donated to Amy McGrath in her campaign against Mitch McConnell for the US Senate in Kentucky.

Too often it is not organized to serve an economic & social community, usually geographic in nature. This is a fresh opportunity to organize a new process: that process will be (good or bad -- hopefully overwhelming fair) the basis for the next group -- 10 years from now.

Starting in electronics, communications/rf, systems engineer & repair, leading to networking, and computer repair. In all cases solutions to problems had to fit the conditions -- you can't fake data to solve a problem. Research often solved problems (similar problems, or seemingly similar problems often lead to accurate answers). Sometimes you found out that you didn't have enough information; I couldn't be afraid to ask for additional resources when potential solutions didn't work, or results didn't meet expectations. In other words, sometimes you have to start over, as the apparent scope of the problem didn't fit the results. It happened occasionally -- let your customer know that a problem remained unresolved and add additional resources to the data gathering (where often information about prior work changed the resulting efforts). As well as add additional 3rd party technical expertise (more finite analysis of the symptoms). With my business it isn't much different. If a customer wants some work done I am not particularly familiar with, I research the request: process, materials, tooling, time required, ability to master the techniques in a timely matter; will it be financially worth it to do the work (do I expect to do it again, not make as much margin; will the first customer be willing to pay enough to do the work, etc). If it's a small enough part of a job, do I take a loss for the work in the rest of the project? Do I know someone better suited for the work? Do I want to do the work?","Most of my life I have been in repair in one field or another, the past few years in a new career field running my own business. In all cases this has meant learning, researching, brainstorming, and creating processes. Almost always on a team (at least for significant issues). Considering a large list of inputs, then whittling them down by the conditions to the best or most likely results. Everyone wants to contribute -- it's voluntary to even be on the committee. And everyone has something of value to contribute. Some will contribute ideas, some will contribute by asking hard questions or requiring accurate data. Others simply by putting together data. Even those that aren't in agreement force the rest to confirm their reasons for a decision. Being fair is usually as simple as being polite -- let the other person have a say, wait for your turn, etc. Being impartial shouldn't be an issue for anyone on the committee -- leave it at the door; this is a job as much as it is a civic responsibility.","Advocate for Colorado gun rights, attended Legislature meetings.

When I was younger I was always interested in and followed politics but due to frequent moves and other major life events just didn't have time to dedicate to volunteering or activism in any significant way. However, due to the current political environment and the birth of my child, I feel a greater call to personally get involved in shaping the future of our country for the better. I know that redistricting is a crucial to ensuring equal representation in our government, but I worry that it perhaps isn't as exciting as other opportunities for people to get involved leaving a vacuum of passionate people.

How do you take a reality and recreate it to a two dimensional form? How do you synthesize information into an easily digestible format? To do this you have to gather all the relevant information (reference photos for my work, census data for mapping). Then analyzing this information, which for me involves taking the whole and breaking it down into smaller manageable pieces and considering it from all angles. Then from that analysis you form your conclusions and that information to build the final product. I think my experience as an artist has a lot of overlap with and would be a useful asset to the redistricting project.","I was raised as a conservative, and my parents are still staunch conservatives while my husband and his family is very liberal, so on a personal level, I am used to straddling the line of impartiality often.

From large transit agencies such as RTD in Denver, to very small rural agencies such as the Dolores County Senior Transportation Program, I worked to make sure that all voices and viewpoints were heard and represented.

Among other things, this means that district lines are not written in such a way to ensure a particular outcome, but rather that citizens in each district are given real choice with candidates that attend to the needs and interests of the population.  Second, I am a strong believer in shared community responsibility.  While it is easy to criticize the decisions of others, we often forget how difficult it is to shoulder the decisions.  I offer my time and effort to share that responsibility.","I have concentrated my efforts on addressing environmental issues and community support.  These are issues I take a hands-on approach to through my volunteer activities and then focus on through my classes (regularly teaching an upper division course at CU Boulder focused on environmental policy, for example)","Boulder Rotary Club; American Red Cross (Boulder-Broomfield Chapter, Disaster Action Team); Institute for Environmental Solutions (steering committee for CO community projects, 2014-present); Global Greengrants (pro bono researcher, 2017-2019); Eco-Cycle (pro bono research associate, 2016-2017); Wild Foundation (pro bono project coordinator, 2015); Colorado Alliance for Environmental Educators; North American Association for Environmental Educators; Community Food Share (weekly volunteer in food distribution, 2015-2018)","I am well-steeped in a variety of analytical methods, from quantitative to qualitative analysis, and seek the best available data to build understanding.  Not all social phenomena are measurable or accepted as valid, and thus I am also very much attuned to how ideas are communicated, sometimes very intentionally designed to divide.  I have also paid attention to the details of redistricting (legal rules, political manuevering, technology aids in achieving politically-favored results, etc.).  While I cannot claim expertise in mapping, I am an analytical thinker and balanced thinker who can spot bias.","Being even-handed and building consensus are critical practices in my teaching and community service.  I seek to identify needs and shared interests in building towards agreement -- moving away from hard positions to language that fosters a commitment to supporting our common ground.  I have long used the negotiation principles and practices developed in the book ""Getting to Yes.""  
In terms of my ability to be fair or impartial, these are practices critical in any effective community activity or in the teaching environment, and most particularly in the contemporary political science class. I communicate to students at the outset that we should expect disagreement and this is partly due to our different sets of life experiences.  Furthermore, none of us has a lock on ""the truth,"" and instead it is the collective set of perspectives that will help us to identify our common reality and get us closer to ""the truth.""  This is akin to the traditional Indian parable, ""the blind men and the elephant.""  With this at the foundation, I am committed to not only giving fair and equal voice to competing perspectives, but also asking individuals to ""step into the shoes of the other"" as we consider why we might disagree.  I favor coming to the middle rather than than win-lose outcomes.","As an academic focused on American politics, I am an avid observer of politics, including of redistricting politics.  I regularly teach undergraduates on issues of American politics, including on the US Congress, and oversee students engaged in political and campaign-related internships (for all political parties and a wide range of candidates at local, state and national levels). I am a regular voter, participated in some nonpartisan get-out-the-vote efforts in 2016, and have been a nominal financial contributor (a small donation to Joe Neguse's District 2 campaign (2019); small donations to state Senate candidate Sally Boccella (2020).",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/32,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/congressional/32.html

People want many different things unique to their own situation, but most of it can be summed up in the general consensus of being treated fairly and equally.  Unbiased electoral maps in our state is the first step in creating a true and just process through fair and equal representation at the voting booth and thus through elected officials.   I would very much like to be part of the solution for an issue which has been troublesome to many parties for a very long time.

The ability to look at the facts as they are and be honest with the team as to how it looks and listen to team members as to what they see.

As a Drill Instructor in the Army several times I was tasked with molding a well functioning platoon which included young recruits from all around the country.  Some of these young people came from the streets of the inner city to farm kids from small towns and remote rural settings and they had to be taught to work as a team to achieve common goals.

My Ph.D. includes a minor in Quantitative Methods. My qualifications include expertise in statistical software packages, such as STATA, and the mapping software Arc GIS. I speak French and Portuguese, in addition to being bilingual in English and Spanish.","I want to serve on the commission because I know that the geography of political districts has a large effect on representation. The legislative change that put decennial redistricting in the hands of independent commissions in Colorado is a move in the right direction, as partisan gerrymandering has made congressional races less competitive: by some counts, less than ten percent of the seats in the House of Representatives is filled as the result of competitive elections. In addition to creating safe seats, gerrymandering reduces the incentives of elected representatives to be responsive to the median voter, as gerrymandering allows districts to be ""packed"" with like-minded voters, and is an obstacle to pluralism through the practice of ""cracking"", or diluting the vote likely to elect the opposing party. These factors combined contribute to higher barriers to entry to political office and lower bi-partisanship.","Through my volunteer work with the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network (RMIAN) I seek to ensure that all people have knowledge of their legal rights and receive due process.

From 2017-2019 I worked alongside Humanitas360 conducting research on prison work cooperatives in Latin America.,"Perhaps the most intense period of training in analytical and logical skills happened for me during graduate school. There I learned to ask questions that lend themselves to empirical testing and to chose and apply the methodology most appropriate to evaluating potential answers. We delved into topics such as whether we can establish a robust relationship between cause and effect and eliminate alternative explanations for a finding, and whether the same findings can be replicated in other settings. I later taught research methodology for the social sciences at the Colorado School of Mines. With my students I explored issues of omitted variables, selection bias, and missing data. My training as a researcher and my experience teaching others how to ask questions and test answers are well suited to the tasks of the redistricting commission: absorbing large amounts of information, analyzing data, and weighing competing interests. I am experienced in the use of statistical software and familiar with geospatial programs as well (e.g. ArcGIS).","My ability to be fair and promote consensus comes from my years teaching college students and working in the courts. One of the goals of teaching about politics and government is to give students the knowledge and skills to form opinions and defend them. It is the instructor’s responsibility to facilitate class discussion and model appropriate behavior. One technique I have used to facilitate the free exchange of ideas is to collectively agree on a short set of beliefs for opposing points of view on a policy issue, and then assign students to defend a belief, regardless of his/her own stand on the issue. This exercise illustrates that competing points of view can be grounded in acceptable ideas and be the result of sound reasoning. From there, the exercise moved on to the construction of a counter-argument, where students would choose what position to take on an issue. A similar process can be used in other contexts to facilitate consensus.

Working in courtrooms I have learned that impartiality is as much a state of mind, as the result of adhering to procedure. Jurors, for example, can be instructed to follow a set of rules in the evaluation of evidence. This, in turn, can lead to a shared understanding of the evidence and to a consensus-based decision that is informed but not pre-determined by prior held beliefs. The process of first reaching an agreement on the steps to be followed in the evaluation of information can be used in other contexts as a way of facilitating joint decision-making.

Perhaps the hardest goal to achieve in the process of redistricting is fairness. The American system of representation rests on the idea of equality of representation of all people, yet we know that the same vote will either fall in the winning majority or in the losing minority, depending on the location of the district line.

As a founding member of the Biostatistics Student Association, I have worked for years to establish a relationship with Aurora Public Schools, where we visit middle school students in the fall semester and then invite them to visit the CU Anschutz campus.

Dealing with money issues as a treasurer forces you to balance the emotional feeling money (and politics) can impair or passionate people which can affect their reasoning skills.

High School Diploma, 1997, South High School (Minneapolis, MN)","I was excited to vote in favor of Ammendments Y & Z in 2018 because I believed it would put Colorado in a position of leadership when it comes to fair redistricting and elections. I believe strongly in fair elections, and while I have my own personal opinions on issues, I also deeply believe that everyone should have fair representation in elections, regardless of their opinion or position. I have been disappointed to see examples where redistricting became a tool used for voter suppression or gerrymandering and am very excited that Colorado developed a process to avoid these outcomes when redistricting. I believe I can support the process as a member of the commission with my background in leadership, communication, team-building, education, and data analysis and I would be thrilled to be of service to all Coloradans in helping to maintain fair elections.","My first experience with organizing was in 2001-2001 when I served as an Americorps community organizer for a year, working with residents of mobile home parks, lawyers, and advocates to represent the interest of mobile home residents and to lobby cities, counties and the state to promote affordable housing solutions. From that role I moved into the field of education and public health promotion. Recently as a member of the board of directors for the Colorado Mountain Club, I have represented the organization in a development and fundraising capacity to community partners. I have also represented my industry (outdoor/climbing industry) by participating on the board of advisors for the Warren Tech High School Outdoor Leadership Program as well as at the Climbing Wall Association annual conference, where I have participated as a panelist. In my current employment, I have also advocated internally to promote access to climbing for community groups and partners, which has led to long-term engagement with several community groups.","Board of Directors, Colorado Mountain Club, October 2019-present Board of Industry Advisors, Warren Tech High School, Outdoor Leadership Program, 2017-present Climbing Wall Association, 2016-present","Some of my past jobs and training have involved significant data-analysis and program evaluation, but regardless of my role I am a data seeker in my decision making process. And while I try to empathize with an emotional perspective, I do not let emotional arguments determine my decision making. As an example, in the customer service context that I operate in currently, an individual might bring up a complaint or may be vocal about an opinion. As convincing as they may be about their concern or opinion, I will dive much deeper into the root of the issue to determine if their concern is widely held or represents a larger problem, before making a decision based on one or a handful of comments. It can be tempting to make decisions based only on an individual's compelling argument or emotional plea, but I am committed to delving deeper and gathering more information to understand a problem better (and determine if it is in fact a problem) before attempting to solve it. In the real world, great data doesn't always exist, so to avoid analysis paralysis and be in a position to move forward, I supplement data-analysis with experience, seeking input, and discussing options, and considering potential outcomes before making a decision. I also keep in mind the larger goal - solving a problem should be in service of achieving our vision and mission. For example, my company's current vision is to transform the world through the experience of climbing (we run climbing gyms). When I receive input from customers, I will consider the problem of a member feeling excluded from the community much more seriously than the problem of our gym not having a sauna for member use. One problem (inclusion) is directly related to achieving our vision, the other (sauna) simply represents someone's personal preference for their gym experience, but solving that problem will not contribute materially to our overall vision. Part of the reason I would like to be involved in this commission is because I enjoy the process of problem solving and am excited to participate in the challenging process of redistricting for Colorado.","I am a big-picture thinker and in my job am frequently required to move a group toward consensus. Of course I have personal opinions on issues, but I do let let an attachment to a particular position cloud my ability to consider many perspectives and keep the larger objective in mind. I have found that my own opinions often evolve as I engage in discussion or a consensus-building process, so I have learned over the years that my initial position on may not be my final position - all of which is to say I am committed to achieving the larger goal/vision of my work than remaining attached to a particular strategy/tactic or position. I am able to listen actively and engage with people who hold perspectives different from my own to reach conclusions or take action. In a group setting such as this commission, I could play a role of facilitator, active listener, observer, and monitor (in the sense of monitoring if our work is on track or identifying if we are getting away from the bigger goal/objective). A major professional challenge I have moved through recently is a merger of two companies, and my role at a leader in the organization was to repeatedly express the vision of the company, the objectives/goals we are moving toward, gather input from stakeholders, and to have conversations that build buy-in to our new company's direction. In this process, I have been able to support two large teams in moving in a new direction, finding common ground with this direction, and generally feeling bought-in to our collective work and the outcomes. I like to approach problem solving as a collaborative learning process, where through the process we elevate the group's collective knowledge and wisdom to come up with solutions and make decisions that best serve our common goal. In this process, I may not always get ""my way,"" but I also know that a group can come up with more brilliant, practical, or elegant solutions that I could on my own, so I promote collaboration, learning, and always refocusing on our common goals. I believe I also am well equipped to be fair and impartial on this commission. I do not put my personal opinions/values above the larger goal, in this case supporting fair redistricting and fair elections. As a manager and supervisor, I have tried to apply principles of fairness to my teams, to reduce the possibility of favoritism or expression of bias.","To my best recollection, I have donated to the following.

In addition to training and application of these abilities, I have also become adept at consuming large amounts of data and information and synthesizing it all to distill it and present it in a way that is consumable to and true to the original sources of information.","Throughout my career, I have worked with organizations that have sought to build common ground and find a path forward that is as inclusive as possible.

Later, working in the United States Senate, my work as legislative staff was not to tow party lines, but to ensure that the concerns and issues of constituents were accurately reflected in the legislative analysis and research that informed the decisions of the elected official.

I have been in the business of victim advocacy for 17 years and have been working in cultural community-based nonprofits since 1990; whether I lived in urban Denver, or rural Nebraska, or in the growing and progressing Colorado Springs. You will see in my resume that I have served community in local, statewide, and national positions as a technical assistance provider for victim service nonprofits in a variety of settings.","I have earned a GED from the Emily Griffith School of opportunity in 1989 when I left South High School in Denver’s Washington Park neighborhood which is the same school from which my parents graduated and where they met. I attended the Community College of Denver until I became pregnant and left school to raise my children and take care of my family. As an adult, I attended the Women’s College at the University of Denver but have not completed the degree requirements
Over the past 20 years I have built a solid career as a victim advocate, a technical assistance provider, a researcher, and a trainer. I have recently become an unlicensed psychotherapist in the state of Colorado and am attending a yearlong certification course for MindBody Therapy. While I continue to hold out for finishing my university degree one day, over the course of my life I have educated myself, being well read and well mentored. I have attended at least 30 hours of continuing education training in each of the last 20 years.","I want to serve on the commission for multiple reasons.
First, I was asked to apply by someone I respect and admire as a leader in the city. I want to honor that request, and their recognition of me in the community, as a trusted person. 
Also, I love Colorado. This is my home, where I was born, and raised and have worked and built my life. I have benefited from this state and have on purpose made this my home. 
In different professional roles I have had the opportunity to see the majority of the state with my own heart and eyes. As a child, being a native of Colorado, I traveled and stayed with family in different parts in most of Southern Colorado and along what is now known as the Front Range. I feel connected to rural and frontier Colorado as well as urban centers because of my time in and connections with colleagues, friends, and family who span all of Colorado. 
I come from a multi-racial, economically and politically diverse family. This helps me to aim for options that serve the well-being of all of us. I also know what it is like to move through social tiers and change one’s life trajectory through hard work and participation in the system. I am a testament to that. 
Finally, having built my career and gained professional respect through what some would call, my own gumption, it is also through the network of generous mentors and knowledgeable guides. Many people of many walks have invested in my success. It is my purpose and choice to continue to invest in our collective good and my beloved Colorful Colorado. This commission has a worthy purpose, and I believe I will be able to contribute meaningfully to the commission’s work.","I have many years of experience in organizing, advocating for, and considering the interests of people impacted by violence crime, people impacted by social disparities, as well as with cultural communities seeking healing and well-being.  As an anti-domestic violence advocate, a trainer, a coalition staff member, a person engaged in community research, and through other related roles, I have worked to hear directly from people who are impacted, and to work with individuals and communities to find practical ways forward.  I look forward to bringing this perspective and skill set to the commission’s work on redistricting.","I am presently on the Domestic Violence Offender Management Board (DVOMB) under the Department of Criminal Justice (DCJ) in the state of Colorado. 
I am a member of the Colorado Association of Psychotherapists. 
The organization, for which I work, is a member of Violence Free Colorado (the state coalition against domestic violence).","My natural perspective tends to be strategy and reason. As a person who has had a life full of diversity of social conditions and variety of people and locations, I find that my logical mind is well-balanced with the human relationships that surround me in life. 
In my work I have worked on research teams as support and as co-investigator. I have the ability to connect, value and evaluate the data that research provides. DAta helps to shape policy. In my work, I have also provided connection and support for many victims of violence, having to provide a compassionate connection and support people in learning about and maneuvering with some sense of capacity, the various systems with which a victim of crime can come into contact. I have developed over the years a fair balance of logic and reason with humanity and fairness. Data cannot live in a vacuum, it must be applied to the society in which we all live. Anecdote alone cannot be that which creates guidelines and policy, and it has a place to inform the rules of engagement.","Differing perspectives are important and valuable in building good solutions, so disagreement is not a problem, but rather an indication that indeed people are putting forward their contribution.  Moving forward once many views have been expressed is then the work of respectful dialogue, listening and considering as well as speaking. When others at the table feel heard and respected, we can talk about solutions or compromises without any personal disrespect. Keeping our eyes on the values and the goals that the commission is tasked with can help in seeing that we are all working on behalf of something none of us can achieve individually.  Fairness and impartiality in terms of respectful inclusion, while being values-led, is a cornerstone of much of the work that I do in my professional life.","My political activity has primarily consisted of being an informed voter.  Policy issues impact communities, and I take my right to vote seriously.  In addition,my very first donation to a political candidate was to Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary.

Our HOA covenants was set up unfairly such that more than 1/2 of the community was paying more for HOA fees than others and the disparity was growing every time HOA fees were raised because of a covenant rule that a portion of the neighborhood should pay 1.5 times more than the other portion. The HOA fees are used for maintenance of amenities in the community to which all households have equal access.  I lead the committee to research (with the help of a couple of board members) how we could change the covenants and educate the community on how the HOA fees were used for assets to which everyone has equal access. We learned that we would have to have an election to add an amendment to remove the 1.5 times rule. 

I sent out polls for the community to vote on preferred methods of equalizing the fees. Although this seemed like an insurmountable task the poll indicated that 18 or 19 of the homeowners who were paying less would vote for the change to the covenants.  This was a sign that the task was not insurmountable and we proceeded with community meetings and presentations which I put together. Myself and the two board members presented the information. We held an election and my team and I canvassed the neighborhood to make sure everyone voted.  We needed 20 households that were paying less to vote for equalizing fees and increase their fees.  22 fair-minded neighbors voted for the amendment!

     The redistricting commissioners will probably need to analyze large sets of data that can be organized and interpreted in different ways.  In this regard, a large portion of my legal practice involved complex commercial cases with experts on both sides in economics, statistics and complex accounting transactions.  I have examined and cross examined many, many data experts.  In one typical case, I represented an engineering company in a suit against 7 employees who left without notice and took my client’s business unit.  I challenged the opposing economist’s damages model at trial by substituting different assumptions he had endorsed in other cases.  On the witness stand, he revised his calculation from $1 million in damages to $3.6 million in damages for my client.  I also handled multiple class actions involving securities fraud, anti-trust violations, medical billing and consumer protection.  In each of those cases, we analyzed large sets of data to support or oppose various positions.","I believe I will be able to promote consensus because I have substantial experience forging agreements with groups holding divergent interests.  That experience has shown me the importance of relationships and of always following a principled approach in these situations.

     Experience.  As a litigation attorney, my job was to resolve disputes.  Although I went to trial more than many litigators, I settled more than 90 percent of my cases.  Thus, I spent the vast majority of my 30-year career developing the relevant facts and then reaching agreements based on those facts.  I have been through hundreds of formal mediations and thousands of informal dispute resolution processes.  

     My service on numerous non-profit boards, often struggling through complex community problems, has further prepared me to build consensus and create agreements among groups with divergent interests.  

     I also have experience forging agreements among groups of particularly intense advocates - namely, lawyers.  I was on the management committee for Davis, Graham & Stubbs in 1999 and 2000, a period during which the firm moved to LoDo and changed its compensation structure.  Managing the firm through those changes was often challenging, but the firm nonetheless thrived though that period.  Thereafter, I faced similar challenges and found consensus as the managing partner of two smaller firms.

     Relationships.  In any effort to build consensus among divergent interest groups, the key is to develop relationships with the other decision-makers.  These come, in part, through developing friendly personal connections.  More importantly, however, good relationships come from listening and showing understanding of other positions, and then being consistent, truthful, respectful and principled in all of one’s own communications.  This builds credibility with the group which is indispensable to creating agreements.  Many of my best friends were opposing counsel in litigation.  Similarly, many people have disagreed with me on community boards over the years, but those disagreements did not injure our relationships because they knew I had listened to them, understood them, and taken credible positions based on the facts.  

     Principled approach.  When individuals or groups disagree, two steps help create agreements: (1) focus on the parties’ respective interests, (2) identify broader principles on which the parties have common interests.  Often, if the parties agree on broader principles, they share interests and a consensus can emerge.  For example, when Children’s Hospital had to decide whether to move to Fitzsimmons, many doctors, medical practices and administrators resisted the change.  When we first affirmed our shared interests in providing the best health care possible to sick children, the decision to move followed fairly easily.  When setting partner compensation at a large firm, it was useful to first affirm the shared interest of enhancing the stability and security of the firm by rewarding those who developed new business.

     Of course, compromises are often necessary to reach agreements.  However, when agreements are reached based on shared principles, those compromises take on a different character.  When compromises reflect a shared principle that can and will be used to inform resolution of the next dispute, they become more rational and focused on the greater good. 

     Fair and Impartial.   For many years, I was a serious soccer coach, earning advanced FIFA licenses and coaching highly competitive teams.  In the early years, I coached my son who played on the second team of six select teams in his age group.  I became infamous for moving him to the third team because I didn’t think he was one of my best 16 players.  That is, I cut my own son.  

     In my personal and professional life, I have always been principled, sometimes to a fault.  As a lawyer who holds a profound understanding of and respect for the rule of law, I believe I have not only the ability to be fair and impartial, but also an inescapable drive to make decisions impartially based on the facts and the applicable legal standards.

     In 2010, I applied for a position on the Colorado Supreme Court.  I was selected as one of the 10 finalists.  As part of that process, I was honored to receive letters of recommendation from three people with beliefs and backgrounds different than my own (attached):  a prominent Republican 10th Circuit judge, the President of the Colorado Hispanic Bar Association, and the President of the Colorado Women’s Bar Association.  They noted my respect for diverse points of view and my ability to be fair and impartial.","Past political activities:

It is a critical element of our democracy and I find it sadly frustrating that so many people choose not to participate, and yet, still want their voices heard somehow. After decades of discussions and study, I know that people fail to participate because they feel that their representatives don't listen or have their own agendas. I believe much of this attitude is the result of gerrymandering and it has caused great dissatisfaction among the voting population. All people want is for their vote to weigh equally with any one else's vote. Gerrymandering has inhibited fair elections in the US almost since our inception and it is simply time to put an end to this practice. It will encourage more people to participate and will result in more fairness in election results. Additionally, people are sick of the same representatives and senators representing them term after term. The system, as it stands now, is designed to encourage incumbents win re-election, which limits new ideas and voices in our system.","This is an integral part of teaching the Social Sciences.

I received my Master's in College Student Personnel Administration from Colorado State University in 1976. I received my PhD in College Student Personnel Administration from the University of Northern Colorado in 1987.,"In 1969 I entered Colorado State University (CSU) as a Political Science major. My interest in the democratic process was strong then and has continued to grow. After working at CSU for 44 years and nearing retirement in May 2021 I have maintained my strong interest in volunteer public service and citizen participation in the political process. The Colorado Independent Redistricting Commission offers an excellent opportunity to serve the state of Colorado.

The commission provides a solution to promote fair redistricting. I have a strong belief that the process of redistricting should be guided by transparency and public input. Additionally, I believe that maps should fairly reflect the will of the voters and that the redistricting commission can improve outcomes and satisfaction across all stakeholders. Protecting the voting rights of persons-of-color, and balancing the preservation of communities of interest with the preservation of county and municipal boundaries is vitally important.

Serving on the commission requires the ability to be fair and impartial. For the past 30 years at CSU, I have served as an Equal Opportunity Representative on university search committees, a responsibility that has fairness and impartiality at its core. Additionally, my doctoral dissertation was on ethical decision-making. I taught an Ethics course at the graduate level for over ten years, conducted ethics workshops for the university and community, and presented on ethical decision making at conferences nationally and internationally. The quest for fairness has been a lifetime endeavor.

At CSU, I have served on a joint-appointment as both an administrator and faculty member for 37 years. In my faculty role I served as Program Chair for a Master’s program with over 30 faculty which required the ability to promote consensus and agreement on a daily basis. I was able to develop a collegial environment and build consensus on curricular development, course content, and student issues.  Effectively promoting agreement involved listening, collaboration, and clear communication.

For the past 12 years I have served at the Executive Director of Assessment and Research at CSU. A position that requires analytical skills and the ability to apply logic. The position involves analyzing numerous quantitative and qualitative research and assessment projects, evaluating programs and services, and guiding departments through their five-year program reviews. I have been very successful in using the data to help the institution increase its effectiveness and improve its programs. I also served at the Director of Research on the board of directors of the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators (NASPA), and chaired the Committee on Commissioned Research for the Association of College and University Housing Officers – International (ACUHO-I). In addition to analytical skills and the application of logic, the coin of the realm in all of these positions is trust and credibility.

I am currently working half-time and will be fully retiring from CSU at the end of May, 2021. I make the best of every day and look forward to contributing considerable time to the commission.

All my best,

Complacency breeds stagnation. There are several elements that are critical to the applying logic and reason in problem-solving. First, it is imperative that you are aware of the Commission’s mission and vision. It is also important to be aware of the gaps/flaws, and create goals that are aligned with the main focus of ensuring equality and adherence to federal laws. Building relationships and rapport is critical; furthermore, when building the infrastructure to emit change, it is critical that you are thinking of all of the people/populations your decision will affect (i.e. rural/urban/etc). Sometimes you have to problem-solve creatively, especially when there may be ""red-tape"" (I don't mean violating law). By problem-solving creatively, I mean by taking an environmental scan of the critical contingencies that may impact the decisions that will be made. One such example of my ability to apply logic and reason to a problem was during my tenure on School Board.  During a community engagement session, a group of community members disclosed that they were concerned about students often being pulled from their classrooms to interpret in elementary, middle, and high schools. My first step in analyzing the situation was to research whether the District had a policy that addressed this issue; I was unable to find such a policy. During one of our Board of Education meetings, I spoke with my colleagues about the community engagement session, the issue that was proposed. I suggested that we draft a policy to ensure that there was adequate interpretation that did not disrupt students learning environments. Although the Aurora Public School Board operates under a policy governance framework, the other board members voted in favor to allow myself, another Board Director, and the District lawyer to create such a policy. The policy was created and the Board unanimously voted in favor. Aurora is the first school district in the nation to have a policy addressing this issue. Although this is one isolated example, I have a vast array of professional and personal experience with applying logic to situations and analytical skills.","My ability to be fair and impartial is best portrayed in my role as the President of the Aurora Public School Board.  The role of a School Board Director is unique, we are nonpartisan, elected officials that have one sole job: To improve student outcomes.  In that role, it is important to understand that it is not possible to please everyone; however, you have to be willing to listen to differing perspectives.  You have to be accessible and open to engage judiciously and democratically.","Past political activity includes running for Aurora Public School Board in 2017.

I sold the company in 2018 and have been a consultant since that time.",I graduated from the Ohio State University in June 1972 with dual bachelor’s degrees in aerospace engineering and in computer & information science.,"I believe that the process of creating districts for state legislature and national representatives has long been one that was hidden from public view. Whichever party was in the majority used its position to carve up the state to its own advantage. I believe the process should be open to and performed by the general public, and it's the reason I voted for the propositions to move the process to the citizens in 2018. It is also the primary reason for my interest in serving on the commission.

The 2020/21 redistricting for Colorado will be more difficult than the past several decennial redistricting efforts. Colorado has seen significant increases in its population since 2000 and the population has migrated within the state as well. Colorado’s increased population makes it highly likely that we will gain a U.S. House of Representatives seat and the allocation of seats in the state house and senate will also be significantly modified. For these reasons I think the redistricting commissions’ actions will be challenging. 

I believe that my analytical and organizational skills developed from my academic background in engineering as well as my real-life experience organizing and managing a company and a nonprofit give me the necessary qualifications to participate. I don't believe it's enough to merely shout about why something is a problem. When the opportunity presents itself, it is important to step up and offer your capabilities to improve the situation.","The founding and management of my company, Meeting the Challenge, certainly is my greatest example of all these areas. MTC competed for and was awarded a federal contract to operate the Americans with Disabilities Act Information Center for the six-state Rocky Mountain Region in 1991 and continues to operate the Center today. The company grew from a single person to over 20 employees and expanded its operations to organizations across the country. 

I would also point to my organization of the All Colorado Beer Festival as an example of my organizational skills. The ACBF's 1st festival in November 2013 attracted just under 1,000 patrons and 19 brewers and donated $10,000 to local nonprofits. In 2016 the festival had grown to over 2,600 attendees and 75 brewers. We donated $85,000 that year. Organizing an all-volunteer organization to produce such an event is a challenge on many levels.","I was the chairman of the Struthers Ranch HOA in 2016/17. 

I founded the All Colorado Beer Festival in 2013 and continue as the chairman of the board for the organization. The ACBF is a 501 (c)(3) charitable organization that raises money for local nonprofits by staging beer festivals. The ACBF raised and distributed over $500,000 during its 12 years of active operations. 

I was on the advisory board for the Home Front Cares from 2016 through 2019 and on its case review committee in 2018 and 2019. THFC gives grants to veterans and active duty military who have financial difficulties of many kinds. 

From 1974 through the present I have been a member of Theatreworks in Colorado Springs. I was a long-time board member, a technical director for several productions, and part time development director for the organization.","My training is as an engineer. I deal in analysis and logic. I have applied this training in nontraditional areas. Whether it was the founding and operation of a company devoted to disability rights, a beer festival to raise money for nonprofits, or our HOA, I have used my analysis and logic skills from engineering to present data for others to consider and from that data to build consensus for moving forward.","While I have strong views in politics - I am a registered Republican - my political outlook is more libertarian. I believe this outlook allows me to see the positions of both left and right more objectively. My goal if selected for the commission will be to move the process forward by listening to all comments and positions and to present my view objectively. Most people can come to consensus when provided with facts even when that consensus is not entirely their opinion. Several of my past experiences have helped me develop my consensus-building skills.

I was active in the Association of Computing Machinery starting in 1982. ACM is one of the largest professional computing societies in the world with over 80,000 members. I became the chair of the Special Interest Group (SIG) on computing and disability in 1987 and the chair of the SIG Council of over 50 individual SIGs in 1991. As the chair it was my responsibility to run semi-annual meetings of all the SIG chairs and ensure that all the disparate views and needs of the SIGs were fairly represented. In 1992 I was elected as vice president of the entire ACM organization. My experiences at ACM, while somewhat in the past helped me to understand how to get large groups of very disparate individuals to come to consensus.

From 1994-1999, I sat on two federal advisory committees to establish accessibility standards for electronic and information technology and facilities. I was a member of the U.S. Access Board’s Americans with Disabilities Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) Review Committee which was responsible for a complete assessment and rewrite of the ADAAG. The process took two years and required consensus-building to ensure that the new standards met the needs of the various disability groups while still being feasible for the construction industry. The Committee received the National Performance Review Award from Vice President Gore. I was also a member of the U.S. Access Board’s committee on Accessible Electronic and Information Technology and was on the ANSI A117.1 Working Group on dwelling unit accessibility.","I ran for and was elected as precinct chairman in the early 1980s and subsequently ran for and was elected as an elector to the district republican assembly and as an alternate to the state republican convention. 

In 1982 I attended a program oriented to teaching business-people and then encouraging them about running for public office. The program was organized by Steve Schuck. One of my co-students was Gale Norton who went on to hold positions in the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Interior and then Colorado Attorney General. I worked on Steve Schuck’s campaign for Colorado Governor in 1986.

I chaired the unsuccessful primary campaign for district attorney Ed Arcuri in 1984 when he ran against longtime incumbent, Robert Russel. The race was close enough that it triggered a recount which I was required to monitor. Barney Iuppa defeated Russel in the general election.

I provided data analysis for several of Mike Bird’s campaigns for state house and senate in the 1980s.

We stand at a moment in history in which we can leverage the power of incredibly large  data sets to disenfranchise whole segments of our population or use that same data to ensure a fair and equal opportunity voice in government and I would cherish the opportunity to use do the latter and truly build a more perfect political arena for the voters of Colorado.,"I have limited experience organizing in the political sphere, as I have spent most of my adult life traveling for work. I do however spend the majority of my free time reading up on the issues and staying in tune with state and local politics in Colorado and Denver. I primarily concern myself with Denver as I am a resident here, and wish to best understand how to influence my local community.",,"I have a background in data analysis, having implemented a fundamental approach to sales measurement and analysis to my most recent team. I approach data challenges and logic problems similarly, looking first for the simplest ways to cut the data to get meaningful insights that can lead to better outcomes, only after exhausting the simple data analysis do I wish to move onto a more complex analysis. If you can address easy problems first, you will be able to build upon that data model to address harder problems later on while also making critical improvement along the way.

I am an adherent of the teaching of behavioral economics, and try to understand how to overcome the inherent shortcuts in thinking to overcome bias and ensure the decisions I make are well reasoned and based upon sound processes, even if the outcomes are not always perfect.","My professional background is change management, and I have spent my career working to bring people along difficult changes in their workplaces. This has equipped me with skills and experience working with people who are extremely resistant and highly motivated to work against the changes. But I have been successful in building coalitions of support to bring them into the fold. My strongest leadership traits are empathy, relationship building and understanding context. It is these three strengths that I think would be most important to building consensus and agreement on the commission. Building trust and strong relationships among the other commissioners will help ensure that the commission moves forward with a unified vision for Colorado. 
I do believe my relative inactivity in the public political sphere in Colorado to date is a benefit in this area as I do not bring potential baggage of previous negative interactions with other commissioners from having worked on opposing sides of other issues. This, along with my historic ability to quickly build and foster friendly working relationships with others based upon empathy and understanding lead me to believe I would be able to help build consensus on the commission. In regard to being fair and impartial, I certainly hold my own beliefs and political views, but I try to challenge those regularly to ensure they are still the views I believe in. But ultimately, being a commissioner is not about my views and what I want politically, it is about representing the people of Colorado in the fairest way and ensuring each citizen not on the commission is equally and fairly represented as we review and propose redrawn districts throughout the state.

Complaining about what is wrong with government does nothing to improve its functionality; only putting our shoulders to the wheel to make it turn--no matter how slowly or seemingly imperceptibly--can ultimately effect positive change and improve lives. I grew up in a family of eight children and learned early on that if I wanted to accomplish something, I had better work for it, and my work ethic has served me extremely well for 50+ years.
Furthermore, in Tom Noel's excellent reference, Colorado: A Historical Atlas, ""Dr. Colorado"" explains and lays out the background in text and maps of our congressional districts from 1893 to the present. The new commission will create the seventh iteration but be the first to do so with balanced citizen input and perhaps, with less of a political focus. And with Colorado's growth since 2010, it is highly likely that an 8th district will be created. While all politics in our large state may not be local, it is certainly regional, and I fully believe that this type of work is work that makes a difference for our state and how fully and fairly its people can be represented in Congress.

Another important point is that as a teacher of many decades, I'm still a believer in doing homework;  while I'm rarely if ever the smartest person in the room, I am sometimes the hardest worker and do a lot of background research to find the best, most accurate solutions or approaches to the issue at hand. I read and absorb information well, make notes, come prepared, and this has been one of the not-so-secret reasons for my success. It is unfortunate, but I have seen many people in positions of power who have *not* done their homework and have thus made poor decisions based on a kneejerk or purely partisan perspective. This cannot be the case on this extraordinarily important venture that Colorado is undertaking. Once the Commission reworks the current gerrymandering of our state, we will have better government; this I truly believe or I would not be willing to put in the great amount of time that this commission will require of me. Luckily, I am in great health and have a positive attitude, so I am up to the challenge!","My primary experience has been on the Durango 9-R School Board, where we seven and then five board members advocated for and considered the interests and needs of students, teacher, classified staff, business leaders, and the community as a whole. Durango prides itself for being extremely community-minded and has a robust interest in its schools and how they are managed. We are a ""purple"" area with a liberal bentin town proper and many more conservative-minded folks on the ""Dry Side"" i.e. the more agricultural areas of Durango. Thus, we must consider widely varying points of views and vastly differing needs of students and their families. Fort Lewis College, a liberal arts college moving into more vocational programming, has a 40%+ Native American student population and many faculty and staff with children in the public schools, and this adds its own dimension and diverse perspective. 

Furthermore, we have three charter schools and were the first district to include the charters in our bond issues because those families also pay taxes and it's only fair that they then be included in the allotment of funds. As the former program manager for the local adult education center for the high school equivalency (GED) program, I am also a stalwart supporter of making educational opportunities available and free or inexpensive for adults who left high school before graduation. A more educated Colorado populace creates a stronger, healthier citizenry. I believe in second and third chances for adults attaining more education because I understand that ""there but for fortune go I,"" and the world we live in requires that we all be really flexible, nimble, and capable of accepting and embracing change but not just to jump on a passing educational trend; so much of our mental dexterity and lifelong learning habits depend on our educational system!","Durango 9-R School Board member, Vice-President, Secretary, and Treasurer at various times, 2012--2019

I have donated blood four-five times annually since the late 1980s.","For many years, I taught research and essay writing skills, from my first position in Parachute, Colorado with fifth graders through to several high school jobs and many colleges, including Pueblo Community College here in Durango. These analytical skills transfer to the same kind of work the commission will be asked to do. We have a problem/challenge to address, so the first step will be the gathering, reading, and digesting of a great amount of information--population demographics, predicted growth/shrinkage of population; changing economic forces and patterns, immigrant influence--etc. Just obtaining and then parsing clear and accurate information itself will be a challenge, and that is why having a balanced group of folks is so essential to the whole process. I expect this phase to take several months, and as we meet we will try out possible options/solutions/compromises and listen to the obvious and less apparent counter arguments/points of view. As Donald Rumsfeld noted, ""there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know."" And of course, there are things we don't know that we don't know, and that point leads to one of the ultimate goals of our work on the commission--to have the people of Colorado across this entire state tell us what we don't know that we didn't realize we did not know so that we factor in the critical and important information that all of our diverse regions face.

Again, as a teacher of both writing and literature, my understanding of inference and implication will be useful as will defining our terms and having a full understanding of the history and politicization of the congressional redistricting and other problematic aspects.

We will ask ourselves and one another, as well as the Coloradans we visit with and listen to across the state, important  questions and gather those answers, seeking patterns that reveal potential changes where they will benefit our citizens. We will push for brainstorming unanticipated consequences of whatever decisions we might arrive at as a group. We will set ground rules/expectations that examine biases and how to put them aside to achieve the greater good of the commission.

Interestingly, I have faced this problem/solution/question within just the past few months with friends and colleagues who say that they will sit out the 2020 election, a position I can empathize with but not accept easily. All of the skills I have mentioned are ones I have employed, and I am pleased to say that a few people have left the table saying that now they are not sure whether they will indeed sit out this election year after all.","This is perhaps the most critical question you are asking of us as applicants because without consensus, that wheel I wrote of earlier can get awfully jammed.

My nearly 8 years on the school board reinforced this skill and while the board did not always reach consensus or meet our superintendent's exact wishes, we generally functioned well and moved the district forward to strengthen student achievement, pass major bonds and deal with controversial issues well. As a Democrat who believes that clear, factual information is essential, I will help my group, where necessary when we hit a difficult impasse, to work through decisions as rationally as possible, not based on an intense personal or political agenda.

My background as a program manager who managed nine employees at one time also serves me well. We were a wonderful team at the adult ed center but of course, not all the teachers or support staff agreed all of the time, and employees occasionally clashed. As a result, I learned how to bring conflicting factions together and had them each tell their story. This alone created empathy and a new willingness to understand the other's perspective. Listening really does matter. Doing one's homework really does matter. Being willing to compromise and not having to win at all costs really does matter.

Lastly, I served on a federal jury about ten years ago. It was quite an extraordinary case, and I am so proud of how I was able to persuade the lone holdout who did not want to convict the rapist; he kept asking ""why didn't she cry out or try to escape?"" This gentleman was only familiar with the flight or fight condition that people in extreme danger or assault often take; he knew nothing about the ""freeze"" mentality that occurs, especially with victims of sexual assault. Rather than yelling at this man or telling him he was stupid or insensitive, I explained quietly about this third ""freeze"" state, and he was thankful for the information, and we went back into the courtroom and convicted a very dangerous and violent person. Letting people voice their concerns, listening well, and responding in a way that shows you heard them--not that you were merely waiting your turn to counter--can move that collective wheel forward so that we accomplish our goal for that session/meeting/day.","I don't recall all of my donations since 2015 but I have contributed since 2019 to  the Flip the Senate campaign, Joe Biden, John Hickenlooper, Barbara McLachlan, Diane Mitsch Bush, Marsha Porter-Norton, and Matt Salka.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/597,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/congressional/597.html
congressional,70,2020-08-12T03:29:45Z,Nathan Deanda,Nate,Unafffiliated,Male,m,Caucasian,True,80031,"KL&A Engineers & Builders in Golden, CO.","Master's degree in structural engineering from the University of Colorado in Boulder (2020)
Bachelor's degree in civil engineering from Colorado State University in Fort Collins (2018)","I would like to serve on the commission because I want to ensure that the representative district boarders are drawn fairly without the effects of gerrymandering. As an unaffiliated voter, generally displeased with the two party system, I am interested in making sure the Colorado State representatives in congress are elected fairly and competitively. 

Colorado unfortunately has a history of gerrymandering in order to give one political party more power over another. Districting commissions often also re-draw districting lines in order to protect their own seat (or the incumbent member of their party) in office. These tactics need to stop in order for the voice of the people of Colorado to truly be heard. If the districts are organized such that the representative earns the votes of their constituents. This is very important to me as a Colorado voter because not only to I want my voice to be heard, but I want to ensure the same for my fellow Coloradans. Especially if Colorado is to obtain an eighth seat in the House of Representatives. 

The great President John F. Kennedy said, “Let us not seek the Republican answer of the Democratic answer, but the right answer. Let us not seek to fix the blame for the past. Let us accept our own responsibility for the future.” My primary goal as a member of this commission will be to seek that right answer. I love this state, and I believe that the governmental tactics and changes taking place here in Colorado have been and continue to be a model for the nation. That is why I am interested in serving on the commission, not only to serve my state but to serve my country.","As a general contractor, it was important to maintain a positive relationship with all of the trade partners working on site to keep them coordinated and functional. As a project engineer with Martines Palmeiro Construction (MPC) I had to advocate for both the organizations who worked under mine and our clients in the day-to-day tasks in the field. Often times a trade partner would interfere with another trade partner’s work for their own convenience. I had to ensure that the best interests of all the trades were executed in order maintain a functional site. Furthermore, it was also my responsibility to ensure that the best interests of the owner were being executed despite the fact that the owner was not present on site. Nearly all of the trade partners I worked with are based in Colorado, as many of them are small businesses in the Denver area.","I spent the majority of the past five years since November 10, 2015 as a student at both Colorado State University (CSU) in Fort Collins and University of Colorado (CU) in Boulder. Because of this most of my public involvement was within my university community. At CSU I served as student ambassador for the College of Engineering, which I belonged to. As an ambassador I worked primarily with high school students considering majoring in engineering, at CSU or otherwise. I gave advice to these students as they made their college decisions and offered my perspective to them as both an engineering student and as a CSU Ram. 

At the end of my undergraduate education at CSU, I joined a professional origination known as the Order of the Engineer. This is an organization that upholds the ethical standards of engineers in our society. As many people entrust their lives with the structures and technology designed by engineers, this organization continuously reminds them of the responsibly they hold.

In graduate school at CU, I earned a scholarship from the Structural Engineers Association of Colorado (SEAC) and have attended a number of meetings and site visits with the organization since. Although I am not an official SEAC member, I am currently considering joining this organization as well.","Being a structural engineer, logic and reason come very naturally to me. I am a fast learner and an analytical thinker. I am exceptionally good at Excel and I enjoy solving mathematically interesting problems. I am also a young and enthusiastic individual who likes a good challenge. 

When I was a graduate student at CU, I had to apply these skills to my research project in order to report accurate and unbiased results. For this project, I was tasked investigating the effects of a polymer additive on the freeze-thaw properties of concrete. To do this, I had to college and analyze a significant amount of data over the course of several months. I also had to write and defend my thesis in front of several faculty members and concrete experts to prove my results were valic. I would take a similar approach to the task of re-districting Colorado. My “data collection” phase would involve hearing the voices of my fellow Coloradans scattered throughout the state. My “analysis” phase would be the actual re-drawing of the district lines with the assistance of the other commissioners. And finally my “defense” phase would be to convince and mediate among the other members of the committee.","As a member of the commission, I will advocate for the use of the shortest-split line method to divide the voters throughout the state into fairly divided, equally populated areas. The use of this algorithm is at least a good place to start, because it uses a mathematical method that is free of bias. I would also use that as an argument among the other commissioners, because you can’t argue with math. As an engineer, I am good at both being analytical and convincing of an impartial answer. 

Next, I think it’s worth considering the cultural density of the various areas of the state. For example, because Baca County and Prowers County are culturally similar to each other, it may make sense to group them together in the same district. However, it is important to make sure there is a healthy amount of competition for the candidates running to represent these districts. For example if it is known that the majority of voters in Weld County are Republicans and the majority of voters in Larimer County are Democrats, it may make sense to group Weld and Larimer County together in the same district to encourage both the Republican and Democratic candidates for that district to campaign harder to earn their votes.","In the past five years, I have been interested but not heavily involved in political activities outside of voting. I have not given money to any organizations other than the perchance a Marco Rubio bumper sticker in 2016. At the end of 2019 I also signed a petition in Colorado that put Proposition 115 on the 2020 ballot and made a $5 donation supporting the initiative 

Although I grew up in a mostly conservative household, I am an independent thinker who may align with the Libertarian party rather than the Democratic or Republican party. I even voted Libertarian in 2016 because I felt that both of the two major candidates were not representative of how most people in America think. But because I do not want to subject myself a political party, I am an unaffiliated citizen and have chosen to apply for this commission as such.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/70,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/congressional/70.html

Having lived in CD 7, 2 and 3 I have a good understanding of the similarities and differences in each district.   But more importantly, I am familiar with each of the counties in Colorado and their unique needs and how important the local control is to their citizens.  I want to assure that all are represented in the redistricting.","My past position as the Director of Aging and Adult Services for the Colorado Department of Human Services, I advocated for Older Adults, Adults with Disabilities, and low-income adults.  I worked closely with the County Departments of Human Services, Area Agencies on Aging, Aging Disability Resource Centers, Independent Living Centers, community providers, State Legislators, other State Departments, advocate groups, the Colorado Commission on Aging, Colorado Cross Disability Coalition and stakeholders.  I am the Legislative Committee co-chair and on the Board of Colorado Senior Lobby for the past 6 years, but a member for 20 years.

I have worked for 30+ years serving individuals with disabilities, low-income families, older adults, and school age children.  I toured Colorado doing listening sessions and getting feedback from older adults, service providers, family members and  social service agencies prior to the White House Conference on Aging, then I was selected by the chair of the White House Conference to represent Colorado at this event which is held every 10 years.  After the Conference, I was instrumental in keeping the momentum going, by providing feedback to those who I met with before the conference and formed the ""SilverPrint Colorado"" entity.  This group had members throughout Colorado working on areas of health care, community engagement, protection and support for at-risk adults, ageism in the workforce and workforce issues for older adults, and transportation.

I have used mentoring, guidance, support, brainstorming as well as logic to be able to discuss different ideas and practices.  Between working with the state programs and working closely with school administrators, teachers and parents, I know how to bring people together to arrive at a decision that all can accept.  This doesn't mean that one side gets everything they want, it means we all work to get to a position that we can all accept as being fair and equitable and it can be implemented in an appropriate manner.","My 30 plus years of working for the State of Colorado in various  capacities and in different levels, I have worked well with others.  I started out working for the Developmental Disabilities programs, then moved to the Medicaid unit, and worked my way up to become the Director of Aging and Adult Services.  Throughout this time, I have worked with many community providers and clients to help them receive the most appropriate services for them and to help them understand the different programs available to them.  I worked with the County Departments of Human/Social  on providing education, receiving feedback and coming to consensus with program directors of the Medicaid and Human Services programs I worked, developed and administered.  It is important to remember that one size does not fit all of the state.  Colorado is very diverse and has different needs in each county.  I was able to work collaboratively with the Counties, service providers and clients to implement long-term care services in each county.  In the late 80's and early 90's when the Single Entry Points were being developed I was working with the different County Commissioners and County Directors to help divide the state into 23 different long-term service providers and case managers.  This was a difficult task as each County wanted to be the center, and some counties didn't want to partner and work with their neighboring counties.  In addition, when Medicaid started to serve clients through the HMOs I worked with various HMOs, state legislators, physician groups, and hospitals to make sure all services were provided to clients in all areas of the state.  Then when I served on the Colorado Commission on Aging representing CD3, which is a very large and diverse district, I needed to be sure that all the cities, counties, rural and urban areas were represented and needed to work with the other Commissioners who represented their CD.  The Commission had a Democrat and a Republican from each district and worked on consensus.","HD 34 Kyle Mullica, SD  24 Faith Winter, Andrew Romonoff Primary Congressional Senate, Adams County Democratic Party, Colorado Democratic Party, Congressional Senate Democratic Party",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/884,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/congressional/884.html

I am continually presented with situations involving public health, law and statutes, pedagogical challenges, and school governance, which require both a comprehensive vision of the problem or issue at hand, and an assessment of the sub-problems and stakeholders who will be affected over the long-term. This helps me avoid the tyranny of the urgent and dedicate thought and action to the ultimate consequences of my decisions.","My commitment is to increase district competitiveness, which would compel those running for office to draw their opinions toward a more moderate position. The overall tendency of that in our system would be to promote the virtue of compromise, which in my opinion has decayed of late. 

As a Principal, employer, and teacher, I have learned the absolute necessity of being fair. I ask students if the quizzes I give were fair. If they weren't because I didn't cover something enough, then why not change the questions to make it fair? In discussing contracts and salary, I always ask if my assessment is fair, and invite a conversation and a reconsideration.","I have donated money to multiple Republican and Democratic candidates through their websites, including but not limited to Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Donald Trump.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/1517,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/congressional/1517.html

I want to be part of the solution.","As member and vice chair of the Arapahoe Design Advisory Board, I weighed development rights with zoning and neighborhood design guidelines to facilitate the best outcome possible for the community.  As Chair of Seattle's Design Review Board I often had to manage meetings where competing interests had to be negociated in real time, often in contentious neighborhoods where any change is seen with suspicion.  As the founding chair of Seattle's Urban Forestry Commission, where a goal of reaching 30% tree canopy cover by 2037 was broadly accepted, industrial and commercial interest groups were resistant to added requirements on their properties and compromises had to be made to move the needle in the right direction.  While some of these examples are outside Colorado, my background and experience at the intersection of public, commercial and private interests, I believe, has prepared me to be a valuable contributor to the redistricting commission.","Arapahoe Square Design Advisory Board (Vice Chair) Volunteer for City of Denver, appointed by mayor.

However complexity becomes a real challenge for a group, where layers of information must be processed and given appropriate importance, before a decision or direction can be taken.  Synthesizing complexity is an invaluable skill.  In a group setting, it's often when strategic leadership is needed, and when timely expert advice is critical.   I spent my entire career working in teams, frequently to solve complex multilayered spacial problems based on dense quantitative data.","I have served on and lead several Boards over my career, they have shown me that diverse and even diverging opinions often have something in common, and it's focusing on our common goals and concerns that we can move forward, offering compromise on issues that may be in conflict.   It can be messy, and it's hard work to forge compromise, but it's the only path through gridlock.","I've made small donations (under $100) to various campaigns over the past 5 years.

Bachelor's degree in Social Work from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln","During my professional career I had little time to participate in something as time consuming and demanding as serving on a commission like this. I have always been drawn to opportunities like this one but have hesitated both because of time considerations and also because of potential conflicts with the requirements of my employment. I am now free to take on something like this wholeheartedly and with great enthusiasm. I began thinking about this possibility as soon as I saw the ballot issue that created these commissions. I was thrilled to see it pass with voter approval. I am proud of Colorado for being on the forefront with this new and exciting process. I would love to serve as a commission member, knowing full well how much responsibility this would be and embracing the challenge. The outcomes of the decisions made by the commissions are highly impactful and important. I believe I can help build consensus and provide needed objectivity, seeing the big picture and the needs of our State as a whole while also valuing the impact to various localities. During my employment with Colorado State University, I met with students in the Distance Learning Program around the State of Colorado, with much of my time spent in Colorado Springs and Denver Metro as well as locally in Larimer County. I visited students in Gunnison,  Salida, and in La Junta. In a separate effort I did consulting work in Durango evaluating local needs and resources for a potential self-sufficiency program. I believe I have gained valuable experience regarding statewide needs during the course of performing these duties.","While employed as Executive Director for Project Self-Sufficiency of Loveland - Fort Collins (1989-2014) I worked closely with the Board of Directors to set policy, create the budget, and engage in community relations. During this time I often assisted in resolving differences, explaining the needs of the program participants and staff, and setting the direction for the organization. I took a democratic approach to staff supervision and utilized staff meetings to make joint decisions after listening to varying points of view.  I represented the organization and our constituents at advocacy meetings in Denver at the Women's Foundation of Colorado. There we discussed barriers to the well being of our constituent populations and planned interventions to secure resources and encourage needed governmental policy changes. We gathered data on the ""cliff effect"" that results when families lose benefits following very small wage increases. I attended many interagency community meetings in Fort Collins over those years to engage in conversations with many other organizations serving similar client populations. We networked, found ways to work together to solve problems, shared information and resources, and worked together to communicate with funders on behalf of disadvantaged individuals and families. I continue to maintain many of these relationships today and am sometimes called upon to assist in my retirement years. This has included volunteering for the City of Loveland during their annual event to distribute needed items and resource information.","I have a group of friends who write letters to elected officials and I have done this with them a number of times over the past year. I have done much of the upfront research on the issues this group addresses. I continue to volunteer for Project Self-Sufficiency of Loveland - Fort Collins, a local nonprofit that assists single parents in moving from poverty to financial independence. I was the Executive Director for that organization for 25 years and continue to serve on the Scholarship Committee, host a table at the luncheon, and consult with the current Executive Director. I serve on the Board of Directors for the Sam S. Bloom Foundation (Centennial, Colorado) that funds nonprofit organizations statewide. I chair the Nominating Committee and the Motivated Families Program Committee for that organization. Recently I served on Larimer County's advisory committee to distribute federal COVID 19 dollars to local organizations. We read proposals and made recommendations. I am a field instructor for the Colorado State University School of Social Work field education program. I worked for that organization for three years and then continued as a volunteer field instructor after I retired in December of 2017. This involves meeting with either graduate or undergraduate students weekly throughout the semester to provide guidance and instruction.","I pride myself on thoroughly thinking through a possible decision, considering all possible outcomes, pros and cons, potential unanticipated consequences, while keeping a focus on the intended purpose and ultimate goal. During my professional management years, it was important to consider the mission of the organization while setting program and organizational policy. Constantly reminding myself and others of why we were there, what we were setting out to accomplish, who was counting on us, and why it was important. When relevant I would look at research and best practices, considering similar situations and how those decisions turned out. Learning from past mistakes is critical.","I believe the basis for consensus building is seeking common ground and looking at shared values and experiences. I would seek to understand the thinking of my fellow committee members and identify shared concerns and values. I would look carefully at differences of opinion and consider any bias I might be experiencing. I would listen carefully to information provided by staff and the testimony of Colorado residents in forming and sharing opinions. I would be open to hearing and considering varied points of view, looking at possible unintended consequences and long term impacts of decisions to be made. I would add my own research to that of others in considering all possibilities and narrowing options. I am rather compulsive about fairness. I would consider all the various populations and communities that would be impacted and what their special needs might be. I would be cognizant of income disparities and ethic diversity. How would their experiences with this system vary? How would the outcomes affect their lives? I would use common sense in keeping communities together in the same district and work hard to avoid splitting communities of interest.","I am currently volunteering for the Gordon McLaughlin campaign for DA for 8th Judicial District and also for the Biden-Harris campaign. This involves phone calling and sign delivery. Prior to this, I assisted two campaigns to secure signatures to get on the primary ballot. The candidates were Kim Akeley Charron for Larimer County Commissioner and Lorena Garcia for US Senate from Colorado. In the past I have delivered literature and sometimes knocked on doors on behalf of candidates. I have also made phone calls and sent text messages in support of various campaigns over the years. I am currently supporting 25 to 30 different local, statewide, and national candidates for office in amounts that range from $25 to $100. I do this approximately once each month.

As a two-term member City Council, I had the opportunity to work with a wide spectrum of the community on a variety of issues spanning power lines, residential and commercial development, school location, power line relocation, extra-municipality communications and many more.
As I look back, my favorite subjects where looking at long-term, region wide collaboration and planning opportunities.  As a member of the Boulder County Consortium of Cities, I spearheaded an effort to explore sharing of sales taxes to reduce redundant commercial development and to share library and recreation facilities.  As a member of the DRCOG Board, I worked with a wide-variety of stakeholders from other local governmental bodies to prioritize local and regional transportation issues and to manage the MetroVision Plan’s urban growth boundary.  This required balancing the needs and priorities our Louisville citizens with the more aggressive development interests of other communities in the metro Denver area.
I also have served on multiple non-profit boards and commissions.  My latest work with the Imagine! Foundation and the Imagine! governing board has taught me about the world of individuals with intellectual and development disabilities and allowed me to take that message to our community so that we can continue to implement a world of opportunities for all abilities.  
Even as  private citizen and as a Mayoral candidate last year, I became reacquainted with the local political scene – rekindling old friendships and meeting new citizens.  I got involved with a dispute between a group of neighbors and a individual who was redeveloping an older Louisville home and was able to help them reach a consensus on how to move forward.  I also worked with the team that was seeking to develop the old StorageTech property along US36 to help them express their message to the community so that we could find a way to ensure that Medtronic reinvested in our great community.

As part of that degree, I took many classes that required the synthesis of multiple concepts and sources.  Whether learning the more analytical but theoretical concepts of micro and macro economics, to the intricacies of money and banking to the abstract historical concepts that can be gleaned from Economic History. 
After Northwestern, I worked in the restaurant industry for two years learning customer service and management of a business.
Finally, in Law School, we learned to study the facts and the law and apply these concepts to achieve outcomes that achieved some sort of justice for our clients.
In my business career, I have developed skills in managing budgets, building and managing proforma projections, managing cashflows all while attempting to ensure that we were developing our software efficiently, and getting our message out to potential customers in a compelling fashion.
I am not an engineer.  However, I understand Colorado's geography.  I am familiar with the range of constituencies throughout our State.  I also understand the requirements that we draw maps that encompass the required population numbers in a manner that encourages competitive races so that all citizens are represented.  
I have worked my entire adult life to resolve legal, municipal, neighborhood, and organizational challenges by spending time to learn the facts, understanding the underlying framework within which we are working, gaining stakeholder input, and, most importantly fostering a consensus-building environment where, whenever possible, the stakeholders themselves can achieve a mutual agreement resolution.  I look forward to applying that same philosophy to the redistricting commission.","My strategy would be to first spend time with my fellow commissioner to:
•	ensure that we all understand the laws, rules, and procedures that we must adhere to;
•	understand the perspective, goals, and aspirations of my fellow commissioners; and;
•	Agree on a set of aspirational goals that we share as commissioners that we can refer back to when we find ourselves attempting to resolve the eventual differences of opinion that will arise.
In these times where we see and experience many examples of uncivil actions in our public and private arenas, it is critical that we focus first on what we can agree on so that we have touchstones that we can revisit when we have subsequent disagreements.  
These boards must aspire to be examples of civility, creativity, and action so that we can deliver a result to the people of Colorado that enable our citizens to engage meaningfully on the issues, policies, and candidates that we will encounter over the next 10 years.","I served as a Councilman in the City of Louisville from January 2000 through December of 2007.  Prior to that, I served on several city advisory boards including the Tree Board and the Board of Adjustments. I ran for Mayor of Louisville unsuccessfully in 2019.  I served on the DRCOG Board of Directors from 2003 through 2007 and the Boulder County Consortium of Cities from 2005-2007.

I have donated money to many democratic candidates over the past 5 years including, but not necessarily limited to, Phil Weiser, Jena Griswold, John HIckenlooper, Sonja Jaquez-Lewis, Diane Mitch-Busch and Michael Bennet.

Then the only thing left for the commission to do is to tweak boundaries so that they make sense from a perspective of geography and governance (it may not make sense to cut a little town in half, for example). I think if districting is done from a set of rules instead of from opinionated political puppetry, persons can be assured that it was done with fairness in mind.","I manage 25 people at my workplace and do it from a sense of fairness and respect and try to get buy-in for what needs to be done and by whom, rather than just to tell people what to do with no context.

First, I strongly support the mission of this commission. I know from personal experience that competitive districts benefit our communities. I seek to help the commission fulfill its mission.

Second, I am uniquely qualified to serve on this commission. All of my experiences seem to be pointing to this particular opportunity. In other contexts, I have put into practice the skills and abilities called for—organizing, representing, advocating for, and considering interests. I have a proven track record of fairly and impartially creating agreement and promoting consensus. My experiences campaigning and as a candidate have provided me with analytical skills that are particularly relevant for this effort.

Third, I desire to leave a legacy. If this commission does its job well, its impact will be no less than 10 years, the period until the next census. I believe, though, that the commission’s legacy could be much longer. The precedents set and procedures put into place are likely (with tweaks) to be used by future commissions. The echoes may be generational. In addition, Colorado is a leader in the nation in the use of citizen-based independent redistricting commissions. We may be able to show the rest of the country how to be successful in putting an end to partisan gerrymandering. I want to be a part of this legacy. 

I am applying for both the Legislative and Congressional Redistricting Commissions. My preference is to serve on the Legislative Redistricting Commission. However, I would consider it a privilege and honor to serve on either commission.","Two experiences illustrate particularly well my abilities in organizing, representing, advocating for, and considering interests. The first is when I lead the Poudre Schools District Accountability Committee review of the first charter school application in Fort Collins. The second is successfully leading my homeowners’ association in changing the neighborhood covenants.

As an unpaid volunteer, I was an active participant in the Poudre Schools District Accountability Committee when the first charter school application was submitted. At the time, charter schools were a political hot potato. Following state law, it fell to the District Accountability Committee to review the application and consider the interests of the applicant, the school district, and the community as a whole. I volunteered to head the review subcommittee and organized four other subcommittee members. Under my leadership, the subcommittee created a fair and impartial process by first identifying 28 application requirements specified by state law and the school district. The subcommittee then painstakingly reviewed the application against these standards and evaluated whether required information was provided, whether it was sufficiently detailed, and whether the applicant's proposal for each requirement was acceptable. Finally, I represented the subcommittee by presenting to the entire District Accountability Committee and to the school board our findings regarding the merits and deficiencies of the application.

The subcommittee did a masterful job and, as a result, everybody was angered. The pro-charter people were upset because we did not unquestionably accept the application. The anti-charter people were upset that we did not flatly deny the application. These reactions are evidence of our impartiality. 

And the subcommittee? We had more than consensus. We were unanimous in our findings. By focusing on the standards set by law and first developing a fair and impartial process for review of the application against the standards, the subcommittee was able to stay above the political fray.

In the end, the applicant was able to address deficiencies in the application and the charter school was approved. Since then other charter schools have come and gone in Fort Collins but this school remains strong and successful. I truly believe our subcommittee deserves some credit for that. I am proud of my efforts in organizing the subcommittee, representing the subcommittee before the school board, advocating for the subcommittee’s recommendations, and considering the interests of the various stakeholder groups.

I envision a similar process for the redistricting commission. This effort has the potential to be politically destabilizing for some entrenched interests. After all, if the commission does its job well, some currently uncompetitive districts will made competitive... and some people are not going to like that. I believe if redistricting commission focuses on the standards set by law and develops and follows a fair and impartial process around those standards, it will be successful in achieving its mission.

More recently, as an active participant in my homeowners’ association, I served on the Board of Directors when it sought to make a covenant change. Want to take on a challenge? Volunteer for your HOA!

As President for much of this process, I organized most aspects of this effort. I sought to ensure that Board members were thoroughly informed of all available options. With impartially, I insisted that the Board patiently allow anyone to speak and that everyone be heard. In this way the Board was able to consider the interests of all our neighbors. I also stepped aside when others wanted to take a more active leadership role (and then stepped back into leadership when they decided leading really was not that much fun). In this way I was able promote consensus by building trust and creating buy-in.

In the end, the Board reached unanimous agreement on a proposal to present to our homeowners. We were able to achieve consensus among our homeowners with 150 of 175 voting households in favor of the proposal. These numbers are truly amazing--a very high level of neighborhood engagement with 86% of households in agreement!

Per state law, our final step was to obtain court approval of the changes. I represented my HOA in court and advocated on behalf of my neighbors.

Our efforts were successful. Following approval by the court, the covenant changes went into effect. They had an immediate impact on our HOA, greatly strengthening its financial situation. This summer costly repairs were made to the asphalt path through our neighborhood common area. The funds for these repairs were made available because of the changes to our covenants. I am deeply satisfied to see the legacy of my efforts and the positive impact of effectively organizing this project, representing and considering the interests of my neighbors and our neighborhood, and advocating for them.

These experiences give me confidence that I will serve well if selected to serve on this commission.","Since November 10, 2015, I have been a member of and actively participated in: Toastmasters, Timberline Church, Four Seasons Master Homeowners Association, North Fort Collins Business Association, Fort Collins Board of REALTORS, Colorado Association of REALTORS, National Association of REALTORS, and Council of Residential Specialists. My uninterrupted participation in all these organizations began prior to 2015.

In 2015 I was recognized as the Fort Collins Board of REALTOR Housing Hero for my affordable housing advocacy.","My two engineering degrees certainly speak to my analytical skills. More importantly, I have relevant analytical skills developed by working on campaigns and being a candidate. I am experienced digging into voter and demographic data to determine precinct and district composition and to assess likely electorate behavior. 

I am a people-oriented analyst. This means that I have the soft skills to work effectively with others while possessing strong logic and reasoning skills.

I have great confidence in my ability to serve well on a redistricting commission. It is my sincere hope that I will have the opportunity to do so.

Respectfully submitted,
Eric Kronwall","In my discussion of my experience in organizing, representing, advocating for, or considering the interests of groups, organizations, or associations in Colorado, I recount two challenging situations where I promoted consensus, created agreement, and was fair and impartial. Please carefully review that portion of my application.

I am a process person. How we get to an outcome is often just as important as the outcome itself. I have found it is much easier to get to agreement and consensus when processes and procedures are hashed out beforehand. If selected to serve, I will urge my fellow commissioners to first develop processes and procedures for how business and hearings are conducted and how proposed district maps are evaluated relative to legal requirements and competitiveness. 

Building trusting on a one-on-one basis with the other commissioners facilitates agreement and consensus. I have done this in the past by:
> Making and keeping promises,
> Transparency,
> Bending over backwards to elicit and listen to the input of others, and
> Assumption of positive intent.

In addition to creating agreement and promoting consensus, good processes help to assure fairness and impartiality.","For at least the past 15 years I have actively participated as a volunteer for numerous political campaigns, supporting candidates for Fort Collins and Loveland City Council, State House of Representatives, State Senate, and Larimer County offices. In 2011 on my own initiative, I developed a campaign training course for candidates and campaign managers. My current campaign participation is most often as an unpaid strategy and messaging consultant.

My most significant political activity was running for Fort Collins City Council in 2015. This non-partisan race was very competitive. In a district with about 14,000 registered voters, I lost by 140 votes. While I did not care for this outcome, I know in my heart of hearts that the citizens of Fort Collins benefited from a competitive race.

I have first-hand experience and a perspective shared by few others--that of a candidate--about what makes a race competitive and the benefits enjoyed by our communities from competitive races. This fuels my motivation to serve and partly explains my strong support for the mission of the redistricting commission. My experience and perspective uniquely qualify me to serve, having provided me with relevant analytical skills.

I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW).,"I would love to serve on the commission because I am passionate about equality, equity and justice. I am the kind of person that considers all sides and fairness is one of my core values. I have been able to use my skills at CMHIP with positive results for 10 years now; being on a committee where my work will have a positive effect on all Coloradoans and the citizens of the USA would be a dream come true!","As the director of Social Work department my mission is many-fold. I am in the position to advocate for better working conditions and salaries for my staff, advocate for the patients to ensure their rights are not being violated and advocate for the patients’ social supports such that they are treated with dignity and respect when they call to see how their loved one is doing in our custody.
I have been a member of Colorado WINS, where I took these issues and came up with a strategy to get a salary increase for Social Workers in the Colorado Department of Human Services (CDHS). I worked on this for 8 years without tiring, even though I would not get an increase myself. Because of my advocacy large salary increases came to all the Social Workers in the CDHS in July 2018! These were not regular raises but compression pay that raised the Social Workers pay to be competitive with the Department of Corrections and the private sector. 
I was on the Executive Steering Committee for the collaboration between employees at CMHIP and Executive management at CDHS for 4 years. Being elected to this committee by the employees at CMHIP gave me the opportunity and put me in a position to speak to executive staff at CDHS regarding the need for compression pay for the Social Workers.","I am a member of the NAACP, Colorado WINS, National Association of Social Workers, and Association of Black Social Workers. I am also a member of the Daughters of Promise a group of women who sing at different fundraisers and vigils for different  causes, i.e., immigration, voting suppression and other current events/issues.","One of my responsibilities as the director of the Social Work department is to ensure that every patient has a Social Worker per Centers for Medicaid/Medicare regulations. At one point the department was down 50% (14 staff) and I had to figure out how we were going to cover 494 patients with half of a department. I was able to implement a plan with the buy in of the Social Workers until we were able to hire more staff. 
The main reason for the loss of Social Workers was salary. Most of these Social Workers left CMHIP to work for the Veterans Administration because they offered a better salary and working conditions. The conclusion I came to was if we increased salaries to a competitive wage, we would have fewer resignations. Fewer resignations would be cost effective for the company because we would not be constantly spending money to train new staff.
Being a member of the Executive Steering Committee representing CMHIP, I had to present issues in a way that the Executives at CDHS would be open to hearing the issues and the solutions provided. Being elected to this committee by the employees at CMHIP gave me the opportunity and put me in a position to speak to executive staff on a regular basis regarding the need for compression pay for the Social Workers. This was one of the last items CDHS supported in the legislature before their 2nd term was completed. Recruitment and retention have increased since compression pay was implemented with only 2 resignations in the last 2.5 years.","This is exactly what the profession of Social Work does. Social Workers looks to right injustices, advocate for victims, community advocates for change. I have wanted to be a Social Worker since I was 5 years old, it's in my blood. As I stated in my statement above fairness is one of my core values. Though I am not applying for a Social Work position I believe my experience as a Social Worker makes me an excellent candidate for the commission.","I donate monthly to ActBlue, I have donated several times recently to the Biden/Harris campaign. I donate monthly to PushBlack and Colorado WINS/COPE. I have been a moderator for question and answer sessions of political candidates that wanted to be endorsed by Colorado WINS.

I think I could provide the commission with a knowledgeable voice, based on my education & professional experience with GIS. However, I am not deeply involved in politics (aside from being an engaged citizen).","I do not organize, represent, or advocate for any groups, organizations, or associations.","8/2015-present: House for All Sinner and Saints (church)

I studied the strengths & weaknesses of various algorithms for generating ""neutral"" district sets. I have experience explaining complicated scientific problems to lay audiences. Professionally, I am called on to provide logical, reasonable analyses to complex problems as a matter of course.","I am not involved in many organizations, but in my professional work, I spend a lot of time developing consensus between groups with different points of view, sometimes in rather contentious settings. For example, I was the response manager for the Gold King Mine spill site for two years. I had to work with community members, EPA, BLM, the Uncompaghre Ute tribe, neighbors, & landowners to complete our scope of work, while managing my own team of workers and subcontractors.  That experience taught me how to listen to opposing points of view and genuinely consider how to incorporate those viewpoints and concerns. 

I am also truly disinterested in dictating the outcome of any election, other than making it fair. I would be thrilled for every Congressional district in Colorado to be competitive, if its electorate was truly split. I want distinct parts of the state to be represented, not packed or cracked. I think that fair redistricting may help revive belief in our system of government.","In 2016 I was a delegate to the Denver County Democratic Convention.

My career since school has been as a researcher in public health studying drug abuse across the nation. Relevant to this application, I'm an expert in statistics, demography, and spatial mapping. More broadly, I'm also an expert in epidemiology, research study design, and technical writing.","I believe districting must be scientifically based so that votes from citizens best represent the will of the people. Modern statistical and GIS techniques should be employed so that demography and geography are leveraged for the benefit of the people. Independence of the commission is of utmost value, so that partisan influence is minimized. Colorado's split demographic among Republicans, Democrats, and Unaffiliated is an ideal design for the commission.  I wish to represent the unaffiliated voter, since my political outlook is a centrist attitude, not skewed toward one party or another. I believe my background has the right technical skills, but since I am not politically active, I would fit the criteria for an unaffiliated member of the commission.",I have not represented or organized for any political organization.  I have experience participating in scientific societies as advocate for students and presenting my scientific work.,"I'm currently a member of the American Statistical Association. Prior to this, I was a member of the American Chemical Society for  8 years.  I am not a part of any political organization.","As a PhD scientist, on a daily basis, I employ complex statistical analytics to solve scientific problems (as demonstrated in my published scientific work). Before a solution is discovered, we must correctly frame a problem and the goals of any analysis. Once a problem is correctly framed, then a solution can be sought. I build defensible bodies of evidence to support public health initiatives in my professional work. In this commission, I would employ the same skills to the redistricting task. The redistricting problem must be correctly framed, the tools to solve the problem characterized, and the solution well defended logically.","In my professional work, I regularly communicate complex scientific ideas to non-scientists in government and industry. We learn skills that help those not familiar with science to understand the science. I think this experience will be helpful in this commission. As commissioners, we must find consensus on the best districts to represent the citizens of Colorado. I would need to bridge understanding between commissioners and between the commission and the public.

I work for a nonprofit safety net hospital. We provide statistical analyses to the pharmaceutical industry and to federal government regulators, where our independence is crucial to our success. Our role is intentionally and specifically impartial so that we might provide the best analysis for government to develop policy, not favoring either side in an evaluation of drug safety. We must be impartial so that medicines are proven to be safe and effective for the benefit of the populace. I believe my impartiality as a public health scientist to pharma and regulators would be best utilized by this commission.","I am generally only active as a voter. I have voted regularly in elections since moving to Colorado in 2003. I do not consider myself affiliated with either party. I usually split my ballot between Democrats and Republicans, as I assess each candidates based on past experience and stances on issues. I felt the 2020 election ballot, in it's entirety, is the most important election of my life.  Only in 2020, my wife and I have donated a small amount of money to Kamala Harris's primary campaign.

I am currently a student at CU expecting to graduate with a Bachelor's of Arts in Mathematics in spring of 2021. As part of my studies I'm taking a class from Professor Jeanne Clelland which covers the mathematical aspects of redistricting, with a focus on using ensemble analysis and historical data to test the fairness of electoral maps.","It sounds like an unusual sort of adventure. I was thrilled when I first saw amendments Y and Z on a ballot, and I would be equally thrilled to help fulfill their vision of a truly independent and objectively fair voting map. I'm also one of the few people in Colorado old enough to serve on the commission, but young enough to have studied the mathematics of redistricting in school. I believe it is essential that someone with that technical experience be on the commission, in order to provide the commission with the tools to create an objectively fair map.","I have not been particular active in the public sphere previously, so while I'm eager to consider the interests of all groups impartially, I imagine this is a skill I will learn through my experience on the commission rather than something I bring to the table.","I am a young and generally private person so I've had limited involvement with volunteer organizations, neighborhood associations, professional organizations, or appointed boards.","In general my mathematics education and personal temperament make me well suited to solving complex analytical problems. In the case of electoral maps specifically I have a detailed understanding of the metrics which can be used to judge electoral maps, their limitations, and even some recent case law. I also have experience with the Gerrychain software developed jointly by Tufts University and MIT. I can use it both to measure the qualities of a given map (compactness, competitiveness, proportionality) and to perform an ensemble analysis. This technique involves teaching a computer to draw several billion legal maps that then serve as a representative sample that you can compare any given map against.

I am an adept communicator, always with the express intent of ensuring that all participants feel valued and heard. My past work as a commissioner for the Human Services Commission for the City of Loveland and my current appointment on the United Way of Larimer County Community Impact Committee have provided ample opportunities to practice collaboration and reaching consensus. Both groups are comprised of community members who come together to determine how best to support the efforts of local human services agencies and not-for-profits, using either state funding or private impact philanthropy. It likely isn’t a surprise that the total requests for funding far outpace the amount of award dollars available in most funding cycles. Thus, the distribution of these awards always requires thoughtful, careful consideration on the part of committee members, and then collaborative and productive conversations to reach consensus on how best to award grants strategically to achieve the best possible outcomes for our community.","My past political activity has mostly involved making financial contributions to democratic campaigns, both locally and nationally. I have donated approximately $250/annually to political campaigns, but that number has likely increased during this general election cycle as I have made gifts to PACs support Joe Biden and the Biden-Harris campaign directly. Additionally, I organized friends and family to write postcards to swing-state voters to encourage them to vote on Tuesday, Nov. 3rd, 2020.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/895,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/congressional/895.html

My MA is from CU-Boulder and my BA is from Middlebury College","The work of this commission will have an enormous impact on my community. This will be the third re-districting cycle I have experienced since I moved to Leadville. Each time, I have seen Lake County placed in districts in which we are on the far periphery; once we were placed in a Colorado Springs-based district and we are now in one centered around Pueblo and the Western Slope. Lake County has been divorced each time from our communities of interest, such as Summit and Eagle Counties, and our needs have differed vastly from the needs of other communities in the districts. It often feels like we have not been seen in the redistricting process. I'd like to help make sure Lake County's voice is heard in these efforts, as well as to hear the voices of other sometimes-forgotten parts of the state. Further, as someone who is a registered and proud Democrat, I would be taking a Democratic seat on the commission. Lake County is a Democratic town, but our needs as an under-resourced rural community are different than the populous urban areas and uber-wealthy resort towns that we often think of as making up the Democratic Party in Colorado. Still, we are loyal to the Democratic Party, and I believe my community too deserves to have a seat at the table on the Democratic side as we work through the question of what effective representation will look like in Colorado for the next decade.","Please see above. I am deeply involved equity efforts in Lake County and bettering our under-resourced, rural community. I am a founding board member of the Lake County Community Fund, which convenes community agencies, helps fund non-profits, and strives to meet community needs in Leadville/Lake County. I am also been actively involved in the governance and day-to-day operations of the Bright Start Early Learning Center, Leadville's only childcare center. This effort involves working with state regulatory agencies, elected representatives, and community leaders to meet the critical need for early childhood care in rural Colorado. In the summer of 2020, I brought together Lake County commissioners, Leadville’s mayor, and the LCSD superintendent to help find a new location for Bright Start. I was part of a successful effort to ensure the school district, which is constructing a new elementary school building, received a BEST (restricted educational construction funds from the state) grant waiver to allow it to build sufficient pre-school classrooms for Lake County's growing population. As part of our response to COVID, I organized other boarding schools that are part of the Association of Colorado Independent Schools to seek interpretations from the Office of the Governor of his public health orders to address the unique situation of boarding schools in our state.","I sit on the boards of two non-profits, the Lake County Community Foundation and a local preschool, Bright Start Learning Center. Since 2015, I have served on the Finance Committee of the Association of Colorado Independent Schools. I also served in 2016-17 on the organizing committee for Get Outdoors Leadville, which was awarded a multi-million-dollar grant from Great Outdoors Colorado (GOCO). I am a highly active and involved parent in our local school district, Lake County R-1.","This may be my strong suit, and why this commission appeals to me. There are hundreds of possible answers to how Colorado can draw district boundaries--we will need to select one. Understanding a problem, identifying possible solutions, and evaluating the merits of each is where I thrive. It is what I do every day in my work. In education, we have a principle called Backward Design. The idea is to start with a goal and work backward to identify the steps most important to achieving that outcome—and to avoid getting distracted by interesting but inconsequential details. Backward design works wonders while planning effective classroom lessons, and I could see it helping solve many problems our commission will face as well.
As a Head of School, I must also decide how to use my time each day. I need to determine which questions are urgent and important (they need my attention and time) and which questions are unimportant and unurgent (others can address these problems). The battles that are worth fighting are the ones that will have adverse long-term consequences for the most important goals. I am good at seeing the difference between signal and noise, and will often ask others in the middle of a discussion to remind us of the problem we are trying to solve. The answer to this question will often tell us if we are discussing the right topics.
Finally, I am creative. My mind goes to work as soon as an important issue feels intractable. The Lake County School District, for example, was awarded a state BEST grant in 2019 to help construct a new PK-2 elementary school. The rules that govern the grant are complex, but new buildings cannot contain more classrooms than exist in the current one. Yet Lake County’s school-age population is booming: as our student count grew, we were faced with the prospect of moving into a new school that would be obsolete the day it opened. School leaders saw the problem as intractable, but I saw it as existential. I went before the school board and suggested appealing the issue to the state governing board; I hoped the board would show flexibility, especially if declining construction costs would mean we could add additional classrooms within the original project budget. The school district decided at the eleventh hour to appeal the original ruling, and our school district won the appeal! Our new school will open next year with sufficient classrooms to serve our community’s children.","I am an educator: what I do is try to teach students how to collaborate, assume the best in others, and think critically. These skills are what lead to consensus and create agreement. On the commission, I pledge not to exploit the weakest parts another member’s arguments to discredit the entirety of their positions. Instead, I will do what I try to teach my students: identify the strongest parts of the positions of others and use these to find consensus. For example, I am working on a committee currently at school to address issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We could take many different pathways to chart the work of this group, and we have heard from many stakeholders. In the end, I believe everyone I consulted will find aspects of their feedback and ideas in the final draft. 
Additionally, in my professional life, I am part of a talented, committed, and diverse team. I contribute to agreement by remembering I am a conductor of a choir: everything is better when we elevate all voices ensure they are heard. As we chart a path forward for my school, I need to listen for shared values. Common values often hold the key to reaching agreement. If we can agree on objectives, suddenly we find we can compromise on the ways to achieve those goals. For example, we recently were seeking to identify facilities needs for campus for the next twenty years. I had an idea to address HMI’s needs, but other people in the working group broached a different proposal. In the end, their idea achieved the same goals I shared, in a possibly more creative manner. We incorporated some of my ideas into the second solution and adopted it.

I am a regular voter, but have not participated actively in campaigns recently. I worked on Capitol Hill in DC twenty years ago, and I volunteered for then state-representative candidate Dan Gibbs during his first campaign in 2006. I also understand, however, the importance of the electoral process. I try to follow the dictum: ""Go where you are useful."" Recently, it has seemed like I could be most useful serving on non-electoral boards and commissions.

Graduated Dec 2009.,"I am a moderate who agrees with certain views from each party.  However, both parties have strayed so far to the extremes that I don't feel like I have a real choice anymore, and I know there are many other people who feel the same way.  I've found in my relatively short lifetime that when two sides are very far apart, 80% of the time the best course of action is somewhere in between.  Right now, the loudest sides of both parties drown out any calls from moderates to have civil dialogue and actually create compromises.  There are many reasons why this has happened (media and social media bubbles on both sides, the current primary system weeding out moderates, etc...), but one of the primary factors is partisan gerrymandering leading to non-competitive districts.

This independent redistricting commission gives me hope that it's possible to make non-partisan districts that are truly competitive and where each citizen's vote has the same impact no matter where they reside.  I'm a firm believer in the statement ""citizens should choose their representatives, not the other way around,"" and this commission, if run correctly, is a good step in the right direction for this state.  It's one of the few ways I've seen available for moderate citizens like me to be involved in a meaningful way, and I would be honored to be a part of this effort.  There are certainly other steps that would need to be taken to help raise the bar of dialogue, but this is a step in the right direction.",n/a,n/a,"I'm an engineer by training and am very comfortable with numbers and fact-based problem solving.

My main focus would be to create districts that are fair for all citizens, regardless of party.  I've spent years managing ~30 employees at a drilling company, and I've also started my own business.  Both experiences have trained me to be patient, listen more, and then find the best and fairest solution moving forward.  There are many times when friends or family of a particular party complain about the other side, and while I may agree with their points, I'll often act as the Devil's advocate for the opposite party.  I feel very strongly that the vast majority of people are reasonable when they're not yelling or getting yelled at, and it's this kind of civil dialogue that I will help promote if I'm on the commission.",n/a,https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/1750,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/congressional/1750.html

BA, Government, Notre Dame, 1987","I want to serve on the commission because I believe I that fair redistricting is a cornerstone of representative democracy and because my soft and hard skills will both contribute to a process that will serve the people of Colorado.
I have been interested in redistricting since college, when I participated in a 1985 project led by Common Cause in Indiana. I demonstrated that it was possible to create a city council district in South Bend, Indiana, that united much of the central-city African American community in one district rather than dispersing the members of that community among districts that extended from the center to outlying neighborhoods. I continued working with Common Cause in Indiana in a citizen-led effort to show how single-member state legislative districts could be created that respected jurisdictional boundaries. At that time, in the early 1990s, Indiana used multimember districts around some major cities that diluted the voting power of certain communities by merging them with outlying areas that would drown out their voice.
I resumed engaging with redistricting after my retirement from the Air Force. I provided comments on El Paso County Commissioner districts, where the process was particularly disturbing. The county would tweak its maps frequently, shuffling precincts to ensure that one party would win every seat. Sometimes a precinct would be swapped so frequently that its citizens would not be able to vote for commissioner for several cycles. In recent years, the county has gone to extremes to imagine communities of interest that are not based on the real identities of local citizens. My dismay at this process was one of the reasons I ran for County Clerk and Recorder in 2010.
After being defeated by Wayne Williams for county office, I actively participated in the public comments for 2010 statewide redistricting and also became involved in a successful effort to reduce the proportion of at-large city council seats from 5 of 9 to 3 of 9. Prior to this, no city council members were living in the central areas of the city. I then engaged with community groups to argue for a district that would unify the southeastern portion of the community, with its distinct interests, rather than splitting and dispersing that community among several districts.
My overall takeaway from these experiences is that elected officials have an inherent conflict of interest in redistricting: preserving their own power and that of their political party. These override an important principle of living in a democratic republic: that the voters select their representatives, not the other way around.","The longest and broadest example of such advocacy stems from my service to the Public Trustee Association of Colorado, on its board and on its legislative committee. Working with representatives of all 64 Colorado counties helped me develop a deeper understanding of the variety of interests in different parts of the state. While I represented a very large county, I recognized that proposals that might make sense in Colorado Springs would not meet the needs of rural counties. At the same time, I also learned how to help the elected officials in those counties understand the needs of the larger and urban counties. 
Since 2007, I have also advocated for the protection of public lands in Colorado. I helped lead an effort to map out the boundaries of a large roadless area in the Rampart Range and promote awareness of the recreational opportunities in that area. My work resulted in the addition of over 1000 acres to the roadless area by discovering mapping errors. I have continued my advocacy through developing and coordinating public comments on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management proposals and by helping Wild Connections develop reports on lands with wilderness characteristics. I also take direct action in this area: as a certified trail crew leader, I have led teams to design, build, and repair trails in El Paso, Teller, and Douglas counties.
From 2008-2014, I served as an at-large member of the Community Advisory Committee to the Pikes Peak Area Council of Governments. In that role, I heard the concerns of different groups within the region and helped evaluate priorities for infrastructure and parks.","Throughout the period, Conservation Chair of the Pikes Peak Group of the Colorado Mountain Club
2018-2019 Member of the Board of the Public Trustee Association of Colorado. Also served on the board earlier in the decade, and a member of the association throughout.
2008-2019 Public Trustee for El Paso County (appointed by Governors Ritter, Hickenlooper, and Polis)","I have strong mathematical and linguistic skills. I taught research methods for several years at the Air Force Academy and now coach graduate students through the development and execution of research projects. This requires me to help them use logic and reason to develop methods that will answer their questions.
While my graduate degrees are in political science, I am trained as an engineer. My Air Force acquisition assignments fell into the realm of systems engineering, which is defined by bringing logic and reason to problems. Early on, I conducted a safety analysis of the Air Force One wiring system that became the basis for a high-level decision not to retrofit the system because the risk was acceptable. Soon after that, I helped Strategic Air Command develop workable solutions to a problem with isocyanate hazards in missile maintenance facilities. Toward the end of my time in weapons system acquisition, I was in charge of ensuring that the implementation and installation of a new pilot training management system would meet the needs of the Air Force and the country.
I spent fall 2004 in Baghdad, where I served as the political strategist for the military coalition. To an even greater extent than other assignments, this work required me to obtain and synthesize a vast amount of information—on militias, the campaign plan, the Iraqi election, a Sunni Arab engagement strategy, and many other topics—and develop succinct summaries and recommendations for command. As one of the most junior officers in the strategy office, I had to rely on tight logic and reason when presenting information that was often not what senior leaders wanted to hear. This work was also conducted in a fairly high-stress environment.
A particular strength that sets me apart from others in these areas is my skill at mapping and spatial representation. While it may not translate directly to the work of a commission member, I am very good at understanding geographic relationships. Beyond my comments to public lands management plans, I am a skilled land navigator in the backcountry and have designed and constructed new trail alignments in the forest. Both of those tasks require an agility at abstract manipulation of space to understand how to best create a route, either for the day’s hike or for a trail. Similar abstract manipulations may be helpful in envisioning options for develop legislative districts that serve the interests of the people of Colorado.","I demonstrated my ability to be fair and impartial while I was serving as Public Trustee for El Paso County for 11 years. In that role, I had to ensure that my deputies and I administered foreclosure law fairly and equitably, setting aside any personal feelings about particular cases or how we might wish the law were different. 
I will be able to promote consensus and contribute to creating agreement because I am good at listening to others and understanding their interests and preferences. That allows me to reflect on their argument and show good faith by reconsidering my own positions and where they could be more in alignment with those of others. At the same time, I am able to couch my own views in ways that appeal to the values that others hold. This was particularly useful as a member of the Public Trustee Association Board and Legislative Committee, during which time most of my colleagues were elected officials of another political party and had been representing rural counties for many years.
My ability to promote consensus in those ways largely stems from my Air Force career, as described in more detail in the next answer. In most assignments, I was by rank the junior person even when I was a peer on the organization chart. That meant that the only way I could promote safety, design decisions, or a wartime engagement strategy was by persuasive discussion and making sure that I had data to back up my position. I also found it helpful to let others take credit for my ideas as if they were their own rather than merely coming into agreement with me. These experiences also taught me to engage when I thought it really mattered and hold off from trying to get my way for its own sake. 
I have also used these skills to build coalitions during public lands discussion periods. While environmental groups share broad common goals, they do differ in their priorities. It was important to find ways to get several groups to sign on to a single letter rather than taking divergent positions that would not help land managers reach the decision we preferred. The comments I developed for these federal decisions were always richly detailed in maps and coordinates that provided rich detail about facts on the ground that were the basis of our response.","I ran for El Paso County Clerk and Recorder in 2010 (lost).

I was shocked and saddened how map manipulation in other states caused a distortion in their representation at the federal and state level.  I think this leads to voter disillusionment and a feeling that their votes do not matter.  One of the educational events held at my home was about Amendment Y and Z.  I have become more aware of the importance through All On The Line, which educates people about the importance of fair maps.  Voters need to pick their representatives at the federal and state level, not the other way around.","I completed the Organizing for Action Fellows program.

I developed a spreadsheet for use in our department that can track needed data and can pull information using pivot tables.","One of my earliest memories was going to pick up my grandmother on election day, she was an election judge.  Voting has always been important in my family, but I would not have considered myself “political”. My dad was involved in town council in Pine Haven Wyoming and my aunt was mayor of Pine Knoll Shores in North Carolina.  They both leaned Republican and many in my family still are Republicans. I aligned with the Democratic Party in 2008 because I wanted to help with the convention.  As I have become more involved, I more closely align with the Democratic platform, such as health care and environmental protections than with the traditional Republican platform of less government involvement and conservative social values. With my background, I have cultivated skills that have built fairness and impartially in my core values.
I struggle with the current administration and it is my hope that after November there will be an increased desire for people to work together for the common good.  We can begin this ideal by working together locally. A couple of years ago, I attended an event at the Denver Film Society in which one of the panelists was Eleanor Clift, a Washington journalist.  She proposed that the intense political division was created in part because people did not know each other at the personal level. She mentioned that Tip O’Neill and Reagan could be friends because they created opportunities to be together after work.  With today’s politicians leaving Washington as soon as work is over and not cultivating after work relationships, the camaraderie is lost.  I will suggest that the commission meet on a non-formal basis to cultivate relationships with each other.  If the group as whole chooses not to do this, I will reach out on a one-on-one basis to build camaraderie.","I have donated money to Steven Woodrow Colorado HD6, Diane Mitsch Bush CD3 and an organization called “Stop Republicans” through Act Blue.

both in and out of the classroom. They are generally more candid and to the point than adults and seeing
things from their viewpoint is a valuable tool that I will bring to the commission.
I am a woman, of Asian descent, from a rural community, currently living in a suburban area. Growing
up, I understood the high cost of farming, and how things could turn with an untimely storm or drought,
as well as the magic of watching a crop grow, and the value of a hard day's work. My Asian heritage
provides background knowledge on the minority experience of racial and cultural discrimination. Being a
woman and adoptive mother provides additional lenses to view life. Finding one’s identity is especially
difficult for an adopted child who must sort through abandonment issues, and racial issues compounding
the already complex task of growing up. Women face every day challenges of balancing work and family,
often providing care for elderly parents and sick family members.
Fair maps will help ensure that each vote counts equally, and areas will not be skewed to the advantage of

Volunteering on several campaigns at the local, state and national levels has shown me the importance of
the election process in the preservation of our democracy. Working in public schools and engaging kids
in extracurricular activities gave me the opportunity to work with parents, professionals in the community,
and motivated students. These groups see things from slightly different viewpoints and it is a valuable
lesson in broadening my perspectives when interacting with a wide variety of groups.","As a member of Heritage Camps for Adoptive Families, we advocated for transracially adopted families

In TUFIR we actively supported students and adults who were in the GEO ICE facility, and also
immigrants that were newly released from the facility. We provided food, clothing and money as support
as well as letters to ICE and our school district in support of immigrants. We also held training seminars

analyzing the data, checking for error and causes of error, and coming to conclusions based on data and
analysis.
As lead mentor for robotics I was in charge of creating and maintaining a budget to build the robot and
participate in competitions in and out of state. Engineering requires critical thinking and analytic skills to
design a robot that not only functions on paper, but also in real life competitions over several days.
During the build season we strategize, prototype, analyze and communicate to determine the best design.
We are constantly testing, analyzing and reworking designs. As is evident, I am very adept at not only
utilizing analytical skills, but also teaching them.","When I had conferences with parents and students, I always allowed the parent and student to speak first,
so I could understand where they were coming from and gauge their level of frustration with the situation.

work backward to determine what actions would be needed to achieve those common goals.
Each year the robotics team has to tackle the challenge of designing and building a robot to play a new
game designed by engineers at FIRST. Our team consists of high school students, teachers, and engineer
mentors from the community. We established norms developed by our leadership team and mentors. At
the brainstorming session we announce and emphasize that everyone's opinion is important and worth

This proposal was later written as legislation that was presented in the Colorado legislator in 2009 and 2010.  We worked with business and community organizations and health care trade associations to articulate the significant issues in our healthcare system.  This advocacy for rational reform in healthcare, which would actually reduce the cost of the system, and the cost in the system to governments, business and individuals, has been revived this year.  In 2010 I cofounded and chaired the Coalition for Effective Healthcare a 501C4.  In 2012, at the request of the South Metro Chamber Board of Directors I wrote a white paper on the significant challenges for business of Colorado's very complex sales tax system.  That white paper was presented to the then Colorado State Senate President.  That led to my personal advocacy with mayors, DOR and some legislators.  Ultimately, after soliciting the involvement of American Furniture Warehouse and Colorado Automobile Dealers Association, we interested businesses and trade organizations in joining the effort to fix Colorado's Sales Tax System.  We formed the Coalition to Simplify Colorado Sales Tax.  The Coalition, working with legislators, has participated in the writing of and advocacy of 5 bills that have all passed the legislature and are step by step moving Colorado toward a far more user friendly sales tax system, that is revenue neutral, at worst, and very well may generate more sales tax revenue for the state and home rule cities.","State of Colorado Task Force to Simplify Colorado Sales Tax 2017 to present; Vice President Board, Coalition to Simplify Colorado Sales Tax; Board Member Cornerstone Productions, 2014 to present; South Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce, National Federation of Independent Business","I am a business owner and prior to owning my business, was the Colorado senior executive of a company with 650 Colorado employees.

We have successfully navigated very difficult situations.  2008-2019 was very difficult for most businesses.  We were no exception.  We developed strategies to navigate our business through a significant recession.    the shutdown of much of our economy as a result of Covid 19 has brought a whole new set of challenges that required fast assessment of the looming problem, multiple options to address the business challenges, selecting a go forward set of plans and implementing it.  Our business has been dramatically impacted by Covid.  Today, we have as many employees as when the pandemic first resulted in stay at home orders.  Our outlook for the future is strong as we have made and implement many decisions that have preserved our company and positioned us for future prosperity.","In my sales tax simplifications advocacy I have met with and been in meetings with all stakeholders in the sales tax system - the Coloroado Department of Revenue, Colorado Municipal League, individual Home Rule cities, counties, Colorado legislature, business trade organizations and individual businesses.  We were able to listen, respond to disparate interests, find common ground and common objectives and move the ball progressively toward a much better sales tax system for the state of Colorado.

With my healthcare reform advocacy, we engaged political leaders, business organizations, and even healthcare trade associations.  This is a really difficult issue to rally interested parties toward a common solution.  The actual fix to the healthcare system problems, is not that challenging.  Aligning the various players is very challenging.  The businesses of healthcare themselves are the most difficult to move as the American Healthcare industry is the largest industry on the planet with significant players who have a major financial stake in the structure of our system.  We were able to achieve alignment with many at the table including advocates for a single payer healthcare system, with whom we found significant common ground.

Fairly drawn maps are a pillar to making sure Colorado is prosperous and equitable for all who live here, not just those who live in the right district. 

I view drawing fair maps as the first part of a cycle. If districts are created fairly, then leaders who truly represent their communities will be elected. Citizens will feel their needs are being met and their lives will improve, and they will be more inclined to participate in democracy by voting and holding their elected leaders accountable. Fair maps help to eliminate the power of special interests or corporate interests.","I consider myself an active participant in Colorado's progressive community.

Listen to others and validate what they say. Even if you ultimately disagree, they will feel like they've been heard. 2. When things go wrong, apologize if someone needs to hear it, even if you feel like you didn't do anything wrong. It shows a willingness to accept responsibility, and calms others down. 3. Stay civil.

The idea that political parties have used their power to redraw district lines to benefit the parties is in my mind the antithesis of what a representative democracy should be.  And while I don't believe that Colorado has a major Gerrymandering problem like other states do, I don't want Colorado to have such a problem in the future.  Additionally, as a resident of very rural Clear Creek County, I believe that I can bring a ""mountain perspective"" to the commission.

I also am privileged enough to enjoy a career and a job that would allow me to participate in this critical process, without major disruption of my professional life or paycheck.

Helped draft a campaign ethics bill for the city/county of Denver (the bulk of it's language was adopted as Denver Referred Measure 2E) working with other non-partisan and cross-partisan groups to draft said language.

I have circulated petitions for a small number of ""good governance"" measures (the Denver Democracy for the People Initiative--that became 2E).  I have supported Colorado ""good governance"" measures to include Amendments Y and Z (for example:  https://denverite.com/2018/10/18/jennifer-lawrence-wants-you-to-illegalize-gerrymandering-in-colorado/).  And I have been involved with a number of non-political organizations (such as the""Como Project"" DSP&P Railway).","I have been involved with Represent.US since 2014.
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 357 (airline union)--union member
Air Line Pilots Association--union member","My professional life consists of taking a packet of information (weather, aircraft mechanical state, airport conditions, terrain considerations, and in some cases geopolitical considerations) and distilling that information into a useable plan to accomplish a given task (to fly from point A to B).  This involves the rest of the flight crew I am operating with (I have been a captain, first officer, and relief pilot at various times, all of which involve different leadership gradients), a dispatcher with joint responsibility, and many other entities during complex flights.  All of this must end up with a consensus on how we should operate the flight.  From the moment that plan is agreed to, it is continually monitored and re-evaluated, and adjusted should conditions warrant.  All of this while weighing pros and cons, and operating under a continually ticking clock and continually depleting fuel reserves.

In less time critical situations (which is how the commission would operate), I tend to prioritize a task by critical criteria, starting with what seems most pressing.  Once prioritized, I seek to apply any desirable criteria--especially if I am working with others who might rank the criteria differently than I do.  And once a workable plan appears to be presented, I seek ways to test that plan against the criteria, and adjust it if necessary.","I have spent over 10,000 hours flying airplanes, which is mostly an exercise in assessing information, and building consensus amongst the operating crew members, a skill that I have honed to a pretty high degree.  

I also served a term as an elected leader for a pilots union (IBT Local 357), during one of the most contentious bargaining environments in Railway Labor Act history.  It was one of the driving factors for me running for that position, and I largely acted as the ""independent"" board member making peace between factions on our board.  As part of my experience in union representation, I eventually developed the skills to handle EXTREMELY sensitive discussions (including high stakes discipline, substance abuse issues, harassment cases, hostile membership, and negotiations) respectfully amongst parties who typically displayed open disdain for one another.

As a dyed in the wool independent, I would be unencumbered by partisan pressures entirely, while being naturally inclined towards consensus building as the most effective form of agreement.  I operate in a world that requires a shared mental model and buy in of any decision in an airplane, it's a way of life for me, and has been for over 20 years in my professional life.

I also like to think that I am really good at letting bygones be bygones.  A disagreement with another person on one topic does not need to effect other attempts to build consensus with that person, and it is incredibly important to disagree without being disagreeable with one another.  I basically cannot recall the last time I disagreed with someone I was working on the same task with--I believe because my skills at building a shared mental model lead to consensus so efficiently that things never rise to the level of a real disagreement.

Impartiality is achieved both by my fierce non partisan belief and lifelong devotion to non partisanship, along with the inclusion of fairness and impartiality as critical criteria to work for.  People are allowed to have their own beliefs (including partisan motivations that I might agree or disagree with), but that does not necessarily mean that their viewpoint is not valid and deserving of thoughtful consideration.","Represent.US

Fernandez,John Manuel Fernandez,Democrat,Male,m,Caucasian,True,80220,I am retired.,I have a masters degree in urban and regional planning as well as a bachelor's degree in journalism. I was a certified planner during my career (American Institute of Certified Planners).,"I have become concerned with the increasing polarization of the U.S. body politic, a trend exacerbated by district gerrymandering that creates safe seats for relatively extreme elected officials who eschew compromise on behalf of the greater good in favor of merely scoring political or ideological points. I see an analogy with the shift away from beneficial debate within legislatures to reliance on petitions and constitutional amendments (TABOR, Gallagher, Amendment 23 etcetera). Competitive congressional districts would increase the potential for beneficial exchange of ideas among our elected leaders.","The bulk of my professional career was spent in city planning, work which is quintessentially advocacy on behalf of the community at large and the myriad groups, neighborhoods, special interests and underrepresented factions which comprise our urban areas. I developed comprehensive plans in the cities of Aurora, Boulder and Glenwood Springs, documents which ultimately derive their authority from the people and businesses proactively engaged in a rational and deliberate process managed by city officials. I continue that work today as chair of The Fax Partnership board as we engage with the city of Denver in development of the East Area Plan. I also have experience in non-governmental settings. For example, I served three years on the state board of the Colorado Mountain Club and as chair of the Boulder Group of the CMC. The CMC is a venerable Colorado organization dedicated to conservation of the Colorado back country and the education of back country users. Population growth, climate change and the shift away from social organizations were among the challenges addressed while I was in a leadership position with the CMC.","Since my retirement in August 2015, the bulk of my volunteer activity has been on behalf of The Fax Partnership, a non-profit whose mission is support of existing residents and businesses and promotion of equitable redevelopment along the East Colfax corridor. I currently serve as board chair. I have done limited amounts of volunteer work for Habitat for Humanity with plans to do more once the pandemic eases.","City planning is all about analyzing existing conditions, developing a vision and goals, then applying logic to devise potential solutions. A particular challenge facing planners is the need to avoid unintended consequences when drafting comprehensive plans, development codes or zoning regulations. This requires attention to the big picture while at the same time attention to detail in the drafting of policies, regulations and processes. Regarding this commission's task, some of my work experience with the city of Aurora is particularly relevant, including: responsibility for the city's population forecast; calculation of future land use needs and development patterns; and, testimony in a district court case supporting the city's interest in being located wholly within one congressional district following results of the 2010 federal census.","Drafting comprehensive plans for a city, such as I have done in three Colorado cities, can only be successful by managing a project based on community engagement and the pursuit of consensus. A city planner can only succeed to the extent to which they are perceived as fair and trustworthy. The issues of land use, development rights, environmental protection and community goals are highly contentious and can only be resolved if those entrusted with the planning process do their job in a fair and impartial manner. Similarly, in every professional or organizational setting, I have been selected to a leadership position whether that has been with a city (Aurora, Boulder, Glenwood Springs), a non-profit (Colorado Mountain Club, The Fax Partnership) or even with a social group (A.P.E.S, the Architects, Planners and Engineers of Garfield County). I have also managed large groups of professionals, for example, a staff of 13 in my service as Aurora's Manager of Comprehensive Planning. One can succeed in such a setting only as a servant leader, mediating conflicts, giving a voice to all participants, being an honest broker among competing interests and maintaining a focus on the organization's goal.","My political activity has been limited to posting of yard signs and making financial contributions to individual campaigns (e.g., Andrew Romanoff, Jason Crow, Tom Tobiassen [Aurora City Council].",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/1205,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/congressional/1205.html

I have previously worked in the ICU at the Denver VA Medical Center, as a hospice case manager, and in a sexual health clinic. I am currently enrolled in my masters degree in nursing with a focus in healthcare policy through Chamberlain University.","Over the past two years, I have been re-evaluating my professional career and thinking about how I want to best utilize my skills as a nurse. I have become very interested in the political process and the intersection of how healthcare and policy can ensure more people have access to high quality healthcare. I am currently working on my masters in nursing with a focus on healthcare policy and want to work at a state or federal level to advise, research and craft policy that makes our healthcare system more efficient, effective, accessible, affordable and equitable. Serving on the commission would be a perfect introduction into learning how individuals and communities engage with government and the civic process, and would allow me to use my voice to advocate for those who are unable to advocate for themselves.","As a nurse whose career has spanned age, race, economic, religious and sexual identity demographics, I have become passionate about using my voice to advocate for those whose voices are often overlooked. Since 2015, I have volunteered with Hope House Colorado, a nonprofit organization that provides educational and financial assistance to teenage mothers that come from generational poverty. In the past five years, I have created several educational opportunities to allow the teens to learn more about their bodies and safe sexual practices, while also occasionally being a professional mentor to young women who have expressed interest in pursuing careers in the healthcare field. I am additionally involved with Cobalt, which raises awareness and supports policies at a state and federal level that protect women's access to reproductive healthcare.","I volunteer with Hope House Colorado as the volunteer nurse educator. I have also previously been involved with National Nurses United, a nursing union that I was a member of when I worked at the Denver VA Medical Center.","Many times throughout my career, I have had to draw on logic and reason to solve a problem. Frequently in my time as an ICU nurse, I would need to utilize critical thinking and applied logic to determine why my patient was declining quickly, which involved referencing their medical chart, looking over previous lab values and anticipating what the provider might order to help resolve the patient's problems. In my current role managing calls from employees regarding COVID, I must use algorithms and policies to determine who needs to be tested for COVID and who is safe to return to work without potentially infecting other employees. I utilize logic and reason every day in my job as a nurse and as a masters student, and will bring that same level of commitment to the commission as well.","As a nurse, it is my responsibility to take medically complex information given by providers to give patients and their families the necessary information to make the best decisions for their care. Additionally, I take the expressed wishes of patient and their families about their goals of care and advocate for their needs to their medical team. A significant component of my job is creating consensus among many groups of people with often very differing views. As nursing is the intersection of science and caring, I am able to use both appeals to emotion and appeals to reason to bring people together towards a common goal.

I earned two political science degrees and taught American Government to future military officers.  That officer corps has a well-earned reputation for being the most trusted, least partisan group in our nation.  That’s how I taught as well; non-partisan.  The students still didn't know my political views at the end of the semester.  That open minded approach attracted me to Y & Z.

Building on that experience, my business partner and I created a method to measure group cultures empirically and despite the resistance, fear, delusion, etc. that often invalidates surveys.  That’s a current and concrete example of applying data analysis to human issues.

All of that means I see patterns in data and impartially follow them to their logical conclusion.","I have an acute sense of fairness.  I support the underdog and resist bullies.

I also completed the welding program at Pickens Technical School in Aurora, CO a long time ago (I was certified but it has lapsed).  I also maintain a CDL with tanker endorsement.","Quite simply, I want two things:  
1. I want rural Colorado to have more of a voice in Colorado politics and decision making.  I believe a thoughtful redistricting will help this.
2. I will be perfectly honest and say that I want to influence the districting.  I have no interest in political office, but I have been concerned at the direction things have taken of late and want to have a hand in shaping the future direction the state goes in.","My experience thus far has been mainly in contacting elected officials, unelected officials, and the media concerning issues that are of importance to me.  My main focus thus far has been in advocating for privacy rights and transparency in using cell phone data to track citizens' movements, advocating for having the (once the initial emergency has been cleared) Colorado Assembly decide how to respond to pandemics rather than one man in the Governor's chair, and advocating for the rural parts of the state to have more of a voice in Colorado government.  I contact people via phone, via email, and have begun using social media as a way to contact officials and to reach directly through to people using my Facebook group Colorado Accountability Project.  I am also trying to encourage others to get involved by contacting their elected officials.","Outside of being a registered Libertarian since I first started voting, I am not a member of any political organizations.  I am not a member of any civic organizations or community organizations either.  Outside of commitments at my work (which wold be mostly internal committees like the Human Resources Leadership Committee) I am not a member of any other associations","I am not sure how to take the word “analytical” in your question; i.e. I am not sure if you mean analytical in terms of the ability to understand and parse an argument or position, or whether you mean analytical in the mathematical/statistical sense.  In either case I feel that I am well suited in this regard.  I did not take the road into academia, but most of my education has been along that line and I regularly work on learning new things in physics (which requires the ability to understand and break down mathematical/logical arguments and the ability to apply math to them).  I will be honest and tell you that my knowledge of some higher level statistics concepts is incomplete, but I learn quickly and don’t anticipate a problem.
As regards the second part of your question, I do not feel as though I will have an issue applying logic and reasoning to a problem.  When you go to solve a problem in physics or mathematics (especially once you are beyond the level of memorizing a formula and into the areas of novel study) that’s exactly what you do.  Interestingly, it’s also what you do when trying to fix something (I’m working on restoring a track loader and help my dad in his semi restorations) though perhaps with less or a different form of math.  I feel as though I am well practiced in this regard.","I am glad I’m coming upon this question a few years after I got married, because I believe being married has greatly shifted (for the better) my perspective on reaching consensus among two people who have strongly-held, opposite opinions.  If you’re also married, I’m sure you understand as well.  My experience thus far has taught me that promoting consensus or agreement starts by recognizing that people of good will can disagree, and that someone else not seeing things the way I do doesn't make them ignorant or careless or etc.   Starting from that point, I think consensus building or compromise takes the form of outlining why you feel the way you do, what your goals are, outlining what you can't live with, and then finding areas of agreement.  For the things that you cannot agree on, you return to what you can't live with, and start saying what you'll tolerate.  I think keeping in mind that the essence of good compromise means that you (and all other parties) will be a little unhappy helps too.  It keeps you focused on what a reasonable outcome will look like.
I would like to say that I’m perfect in regard to being impartial, but I cannot.  Being fair to others, however, is a big value of mine.  In my experience as a teacher, I have had numerous times where I’ve had a student that I didn’t like, or one that sent a nasty email to my boss, or some such.  I have then had the chance to catch that student in a “gotcha” situation—a situation where they’d broken some minor rule or forgotten a homework or some such.  I cannot tell you how good it would have felt to bring the hammer down, but if I allow everyone else one free mistake, I must allow the troublesome students the same grace--difficult as it is.  That’s plain fairness.  It’s how I would want to be treated.  As another example, you may have been able to read between the lines thus far and know that I disagree vehemently with many things that Gov Polis and others have done.  Perhaps not, but let me know make it explicitly clear.  I disagree vehemently with many of the policy decisions and actions that Polis and others have undertaken.  In my Facebook group posts (Colorado Accountability Project—you’re welcome to go see), I do my best in posting to not step outside the truth and to be fair.  For example, in a recent post (recent as I write this on 8/13), I wrote some notes on Polis taking grant money to fund some of his political priorities.  The very first thing I wrote is that it’s not illegal and he has not been the first governor to do so","This one will be brief.  My political activity is mostly recent.  I have, of course, voted in every election since I was eligible and try to do my due diligence on informing myself of the initiatives and etc. on the ballot, but it wasn't until recently (actually it was Gov Polis emergency declaration and state shutdown that spurred it) that I became more actively involved.  I have not ever, and do not plan to ever, donate money to any campaign, candidate, or political organization.  I have, however, spent a great deal of time emailing and talking to both elected and unelected people in the areas of interest to me in an effort to influence and change what I have seen happening lately in Colorado.  I have also (because the response rate from officials and the media can be dishearteningly small) begun to create groups and use social media to expand my reach and to go directly to people.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/77,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/congressional/77.html

Chief Justice Earl Warren said “The basic principle of representative government remains, and must remain, unchanged – the weight of a citizen’s vote cannot be made to depend on where he lives.”  While gerrymandering has been with us since the nation’s earliest days, this practice has intensified over the last 20 years to the point that over 90% of House of Representative seats are considered noncompetitive.  Moreover, gerrymandering has been used to limit the electoral impact of ethnic communities.  Gerrymandering continues to erode the public’s trust in the value of their vote and, as a result, has discouraged some from participating in the electoral process to the long-term detriment of our democracy.

Taken together, my training has enabled me to not only use logic and reason to solve a problem, but to consider the human side of a problem to create a logically sound and emotionally satisfying solution.","Bringing people together to achieve a common end has been foundational to my career success.  People will always have differing views on or approaches to solving a problem or achieving an end.  Consensus is satisfying but elusive. Agreement through informed compromise, however, is readily achievable.  A key principle to achieving consensus or agreement is trust between team participants as well as with stakeholders.  Developing trust requires a commitment to each other, respectfully listening to competing views, honestly considering these views, recognizing and setting aside our own biases, and persuasion. Whether a team leader or participant, I work to promote trust through dialogue, transparency, and patience to create an environment all will see as fair and impartial.

Problems can arise from all sorts of angles and it’s my job to anticipate and mitigate those potential issues. In my brewing career, problems were often more acute and required immediate, effective action to resolve. There is little time to deliberate when an enormous tank is leaking, and so I developed a quick response time to problems that does not compromise the effectiveness of the solution. In my academic training, I built a foundation of logical and reasoned analysis since the field of chemistry tolerates no other type of analysis. In my leisure time, I’m always eager to learn a new board game or puzzle because they help me think about strategic problem solving in a new light. Tasks like the Commission’s are a good fit for me.","I have found success throughout my personal and professional life in guiding meetings and conversations to a place that promotes consensus. I once managed a 30-person team of graduate student volunteers, which is a fragile coalition to hold together since students always have competing interests for their time and, being volunteers, I could offer them no material incentives. I was ultimately able to keep the group engaged, and on this and other teams I have relied upon a few key building blocks to set the stage for productive collaboration.


Confirm goals and check assumptions: Do we have a common understanding of our purpose? Are there facts we all recognize? Many disagreements can be forestalled by establishing a baseline of goals and information that the entire group accepts.


Match outcomes to goals: What does success look like? Does this hypothetical result comport with our mission? Why or why not? Holding up possible outcomes for consideration helps ground the group in the reality of their decisions.


Connect actions to outcomes: If we take this step, will it lead to the result we want? The result that we agree will help achieve our goals? Actions can be more easily agreed upon if their connections to prior points of consensus are made clear; it is also important to deliberately give proposed actions a reality check for unintended consequences.


Half the battle (at least) of gathering consensus from a diverse group lies in simply avoiding derailment, since tangents constantly threaten to intrude and have a tendency to build their own momentum once instigated. Furthermore, it is crucial to follow good evidence wherever it leads and to be an active listener who strives to hear the truth in the experiences of one’s peers. These steps, attitude, and adherence to evidence are crucial ingredients for impartiality and consensus-building, and I believe a good process leads to good outcomes. While a harmonious ending is never guaranteed, these factors maintain a focus on the right questions and lead to the right conversations. I will strive to foster this collaborative process on the Commission.","Small amounts (<$150) to:

My academic training was mostly in philosophy (with a smattering of political science), and one of my main interests was in ethics.  The intersection of democracy and ethics is the notion of equity for all citizens; viz. that every person has equal say and power to shape the nature of the political bodies which affect his/her live.

The way that voting districts are set up is, obviously, the foundation of whether any particular system is equitable or not.  Redistricting has been used for partisan purposes—by all political parties—from well before Governor Gerry ‘gerrymandered’ the Massachusetts districts in 1812 up to today.  This has been the source of a considerable lack of fairness in our political system.  I would be honored and excited to be able to participate in this important work.

I am proud of Colorado for being a leader in the movement to take the redistricting function away from legislatures in order to try to come up with a fair and rational process which will benefit all citizens in a equitable fashion.  This is an important step forward both for Colorado, and through our example, for the rest of the country.

I believe that I am intellectually suited and trained to be able to wrestle with the issues that a redistricting committee will face, I have a very strong sense of the importance of fairness, I have strong organizational skills, and, of course, I also am very well versed in map related subjects.","As a dealer in antiquarian maps and prints, I joined the board of the Denver Public Library Friends Foundation almost as soon as I moved to Colorado, from Philadelphia, in 2010.

Two of my main areas of study were ethics and logic.  The latter is something which I feel is a sine non qua for any rational argument, and indeed I have taught a class in informal logic to high school students as I think it is a skill necessary for any “reasoned life.”  I believe one of my most important and strong skills is the ability to reason in a logical manner.","My academic training was much focused on philosophical argument, in the sense of being able to take an open-minded and clear-eyed look at the issues involved in any particular question to be decided.  I have the ability to identify the core issues of various questions and to present them in a clear and unbiased manner.  Even if I disagree with another person in an argument, I am adept at understanding his/her viewpoint and am able to lay out exactly where and why we disagree.  This does not always solve the argument, but it at least lets the parties understand the real issues involved.

In terms of fairness, my belief in the fundamental importance of fairness is rooted in the moral belief which I hold to be the most important to live by, viz. that everyone should treat others as they wish to be treated.  If one follows this Golden Rule, then fairness necessarily follows, as no one would want to be treated unfairly by another.  I have mostly supported the Democratic Party in the last decade or so, but that support is circumstantial; my support for a fair, equitable political system is far more foundational to my beliefs.","I was a Precinct Committee Person for the Democratic Party, Precinct 623, House District 6, from 2015 to 2016.

Degree in English/Minor in Journalism","I want to serve on the commission because I want to make a difference.  I want to make a difference for Colorado voters.  As Booker T. Washington noted, “Those who are happiest are those who do the most for others” 

And, what can we do for others that is more important than ensure Colorado’s voters are fairly represented in our state’s Congressional and state districts?  The doctrine—one person, one vote—requires that electoral districts be apportioned fairly and accurately.  The 2021 redistricting of Colorado is extremely important.  Our state’s population has grown over the last 10 years.  Based on new census data, Colorado could gain an addition seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.  That would expand our state’s influence in national politics and increase federal funding for state projects.  Redistricting also impacts representation of Colorado’s growing diversity.","When I arrived in Washington, DC, there were two women working in the government affairs area.  One worked for the railroads and the other was with the International Ladies’ Garment Workers of America.  Those of us being hired for similar positions had few mentors.  We needed direction.  Twelve of us in the food industry founded Women in Government Relations.  Monthly luncheons featured effective speakers who gave us confidence and professional guidance.  For example, Elizabeth Dole spoke at a luncheon when she was serving on the Federal Trade Commission.  We shared books on effective management.  Our first salary survey resulted in 15 women getting raises after they presented the data to their bosses and demonstrated they were underpaid.  

My work with the Front Range Community College Foundation includes writing pieces some of which emphasize the importance of scholarships in graduating skilled employees who meet Colorado businesses’ needs and how important they are to the state’s economy.  I gave an endowment to the college for needed equipment for students enrolled in our new Center for Integrated Manufacturing programs.","Current:  Front Range Community College Foundation – Board, Executive Committee, Chair of the Communications Committee; National Marine Mammal Foundation – Board, Secretary, Chair of the Communications and Investment Committees; Women in Government Relations – retired/emeritus/one of the 12 founders of the group
Past:  Ranch Reserve Homeowners Association, The Senior Hub, and Susan G. Komen Colorado","You cannot successfully run an organization without realistic budgeting.  You cannot successfully run a homeowners association without realistic budgeting and sufficient reserves for the future.  You cannot chair an Investment Committee without a Board-approved investment policy.  You cannot hire a new investment manager without a Request for Proposal.  You cannot look forward without thoughtful strategic planning.  No new challenge is unsurmountable.  You analyze.  You do research.  You learn.  You get it done.

While head of the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums, mediation was rarely needed.   But, a few situations demanded it.  A member was doing or saying something to the media that embarrassed another member.  Changing behavior and coming to an agreement takes patience, empathy, and persuasive skills.  

And, then there is communications.  A messaging strategy is the key to successfully marketing a business, a product, a political campaign, or a new concept, as well as effectively meeting both professional and personal goals and objectives.  The Front Range Community College Foundation depends on generous, caring donors to fund scholarships for needy students and capital improvements.  I draft many funding requests for Foundation staff to distribute.  The challenge is to understand your audience, analyze their motivations, and identify what has value and will motivate a potential donor to give.  This has been especially important during this pandemic, which caused students to lose their part-time jobs and their parents to lose their jobs and businesses.  The Foundation created a High Needs Fund for both students and adjunct instructors.  Many needed help, which required constant fundraising.  It was very rewarding when donors reacted positively and we could help so many students continue their educations.  One story we told often is that of a single mom who lost her job because of Covid.  She could no longer afford her apartment.  She moved in with her grandparents.  Because they are elderly, she could not search for another job, fearing if she brought the virus home they could die.  She needed help paying basic bills once she lost her income.  Booker T. Washington’s words ring very true when helping FRCC students reach for their dreams.","My Washington, DC, experiences and the various positions I held were centered on finding consensus among members of these organizations with different points of view and varying political perspectives.  I could not have succeeded without being fair and impartial.

I have never worked for any organization where I did not discuss issues with a team in the course of making a decision.  It varied from working with the Board to working with members of a committee.  Yes, I analyzed the issue, researched it, and crafted a recommendation.  But, it was only through consensus that a decision was reached. 

Cognitive empathy is essential in coming to any agreement.  Active listening is effective.  It requires listening attentively and paraphrasing what has been said in any response, underscoring that you have heard and understand the point being made by another team member.  I socialize monthly with a neighbor who supports the opposite political party.  I bring up many, many subjects for discussion on which I know we can agree as caring women.  It underscores that we all have more we can agree on than disagree on in this sadly divisive time.","I was a volunteer in Dianne Primavera’s last campaigns for election and reelection to Colorado’s House of Representatives.

congressional,1209,2020-11-02T17:49:50Z,Sonja Stewart Nix,Sonja Stewart,Democrat,Female,f,Caucasian,False,80122,Freelance writer and Editor,"BA, Political Science, minor English, Colorado State University.","I wish to serve on this commission because I deeply believe in our American system of representative government.  I hold a political science degree from Colorado State University.  During the course of my studies, I participated in the Legislative Internship Program, and was paired with the late State Senator Claire Traylor.  Senator Traylor was a Jefferson County Republican, and member of the Joint Budget Committee.  It was a great honor to learn from her how local and state policy making work.  This was before politics became so wickedly divisive. I witnessed someone with strong political convictions, which weren’t overly partisan, legislate in a responsible and respectable manner. It was during this time that I built a foundational belief in policy making that is incremental and consensus built. Over the past decade or so, our elected officials have moved away from this manner of legislating. I also believe that common people like me, with enough experience to understand how policy is made, but removed enough to be free of agenda and institutional political influence, are in the best position to advise on issues and policy that drive our representational government. I am so excited that Colorado is leading the way to restore districting back to a representational, not political process.
To this end, my work in advocacy for equitable public education funding has lead me to believe that our state and country has some work to do beyond just education equity. Non-partisan political districting is a foundational way to achieve greater equity in our governmental representation.
I also understand Colorado and Coloradans, living here for all but the first (4) years of my life.  I understand what ‘Colorado Republican’ is. I experience the bluer wave happening in our more urban and suburban areas. And all the unaffiliated and smaller party members. I know old school Denver, when it was a ‘cow town’. I entered my young adulthood as the city of Denver became more cosmopolitan. I interacted with our agricultural and ranching communities while attending Colorado State.  I remember when skiing on the weekends didn’t involve a 4 hour drive, and the direction you put your skies atop your car said something about where you came from. I’ve grown as our microbrew industry has grown, and our outdoor recreation industry became more sophisticated.  Many don’t think of Colorado as being particularly diverse.  I know this isn’t true. And I believe voices from all of those sector of Colorado society and culture deserve representation on this commission.","I have participated and lead community advocacy in a few different capacities.  I was first drawn into public education advocacy when I began volunteering at my children’s school.  As I learned more about the state of Colorado’s public services funding mechanisms, I began to see what great inequity exists in our public schools, due in large part to lack of adequate funding. I began to participate with Great Education Colorado, learning as much as I was able about how to repair these inadequacies. I began to talk to anyone who would listen about what was happening, and what the voters of Colorado needed to correct course. I was a vocal community supporter and advocate for Amendment 73.
As a steering committee member of both our local school district’s bond and mill levy override campaigns, I advocated in a more formal manner to encourage members of my community to vote yes on these measures. I also formed an ad hoc committee of community members to organize and advocate for our neighborhood’s interests during the redistricting of boundaries in our school district. My interest and participation in our district’s accountability committee was borne from a passion for representing the interests of my children’s school. Through these experiences, the greatest lesson I have learned it that the best advocacy, whether in a formal or informal capacity, is respectful and informed discourse between people, even those that disagree. In my opinion, it is most profound way to create impactful change.","Citizens For LPS Debt Free Schools mill levy override campaign steering committee member, 2020

In my view, data is the most impartial place to begin a conversation around how to build new districts.  My strength however, is the ability to understand different perspectives in a fundamental way, while withholding judgement if those perspectives are different than mine.  I am also a natural mediator, process oriented manager and big picture thinker. Perhaps most of all, I understand people.  Most of us on some level are motivated by a basic desire to be heard and understood. When members of a group experience this level of understanding, they tend to be able to work together better and more productively, because a basic level of trust and cooperation exists. I think this would be one of my greatest contributions to the commission.","The ad hoc group of community members I formed is the best way to demonstrate my ability to build consensus.  Due to unusual school locations in the LPS district, our neighborhood was quite a distance from our home school, which created a situation where many people chose to enroll their children in closer-by schools.  This was a detriment to both our neighborhood community and our school community, but easy to understand why parents would make this choice. So with the prospect of a newer, nearby school opening due to the passage of a bond in 2018, I called on a group of 15 parents, mostly moms, to collectively advocate for our neighborhood to attend that school together.  Initial drafts of these boundaries split our neighborhood in two, which we had already experienced the negative impacts of. When considering the formation of this committee, one thing stood out to me; while I would be the person who organized the group, and the relationships I’d built in the district would be helpful, this needed to be a collective, communal effort. I wanted the direction of our advocacy efforts to be informed by what best represented the wishes of our neighborhood.  Parents with young children, maybe not even yet in school needed to be included. Parents who had children who had gone through the schools in a divided neighborhood need to be included.  And with those perspectives, a collective mission and voice was built.  Everyone had the chance to share ideas around what they wished to see and the best way to move forward. Everyone had the chance to contribute their strengths, whether it be letter writing, new map formation, local property value expertise, or representing the potential negative impact on other school communities. Our efforts were successful, and I’m certain it was because we created a campaign built on team consensus and respectful communication.","I’ve volunteered on two local education funding initiative campaigns for Littleton Public School, a bond in 2018 and mill levy override in 2020.

I am also a founding member of an internet group called Ethiopian Architecture and Urbanism.
I was in the Chair of Landscape Architecture at the Ethiopian Institute of Architecture, Building Construction, and City Development. There, I wrote the curriculum, launched, and lectured in the first degree for landscape architecture within Ethiopia.","I believe that by having a master’s I have demonstrated a commitment and ability to apply logic and reason to a problem. While I worked at the Ethiopian Institute of Architecture, Building Construction and City Development, I received the highest student feedback of any academic staff of which there were over 200, which testified to my commitment to my position, which was fundamentally about teaching students how to apply logic and reason to their own work.

In Melbourne, I worked as a consultant for the City of Melbourne doing community engagement. Through this work, I learned that people are generally rather reasonable with their beliefs and issues. However, it takes listening with an open heart to understand their issues. This experience gave me direct experience with community engagement and consensus building.

My background in landscape architecture will be directly relevant to this position. I use GIS and CAD and have made many maps within my professional life at different scales. I have analyzed and generated large watershed-scale areas as well as microclimates on a smaller scale. I have generated maps based on several specific parameters and then generated other maps with different, but similar, parameters and compared them. This experience has given me intimate exposure on how maps can be manipulated and the importance human generated lines can hold. Inherent to a landscape architecture education and the profession is the overlap it has with city planning. Therefore, I think this will also contribute to my ability to understand population dynamics. 

I have published several academic works, such as a conference paper and two book chapters. Such publications were all written in connection with various universities spanning three continents. In addition, in my personal life I enjoy continued learning.","I have spent nearly the entirety of my adult life living, studying, and working amongst different cultures and people often with opposing beliefs and values.

Therefore, I would use this same approach when beginning to promote consensus amongst the commissioners. However, as the process proceeds, the position I form will be based upon facts. Therefore, I would not approach this task with the aim of trying to convince others about my beliefs or political views, but rather about the facts and what they indicate. Therefore, responding to the facts would be the basis of my position and would be the means I use to attempt to convince others of my position. In addition, I do not think it will be possible to achieve a ‘perfect’ outcome with complete consensus with everyone. Therefore, compromise will be essential to how I approach challenges and situations and ultimately a fair result. My own family composition attests to an ability to compromise and thrive with difference. My husband is Ethiopian and we have different religious, cultural, ethnic and historic experiences, yet we have been happily married for over five years with a beautiful son. 
Beyond the belief that fair redistricting will also help to rebuild trust within communities and lessen the toxic partisanship of our nation, I feel that my background in academia and research will help me be fair and impartial.","I am politically active, but not in an official capacity. I have voted in every election since being of age. I donated to several democratic campaigns in the past year, including: Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, and most recently to the Democrats in Georgia to help flip the Senate. Before this year, I do not believe that I have  donated to other political campaigns. I often write letters and call political leaders when there is legislation to be decided and I want my voice heard regarding that legislation. I have been doing this for years, including while I lived abroad. Lately, I have been regularly active in campaigning to end the culling of geese and for more transparency  in the city of Denver. Through this process, I have become more aware of how the City Council, Denver Parks and Recreation, and the Mayor’s office operate. Together with other advocates, we are working to set up a community science group to watch the lakes and learn more about the geese. 
While living in Moscow, Russia, I volunteered with an organization that helps forced migrants and refugees, where I taught English on a weekly basis. I later started volunteer translating for the European Court for Human Rights. For this position I would translate legal documents from Russian into English that would be presented to the Court. The vast majority of these cases were against the Russian Federation.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/2433,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/congressional/2433.html

A two-party political system with noncompetitive districts means primaries become too polarized. Candidates only have to compete with a staunch base and not have to compete with the general population. That leads to a polarized legislative body unwilling to compromise with the opposing party. Scott Tipton was an effective, conservative representative for the 3rd District of Colorado but the hard core base that shows up for primaries elected what I consider a ""fringe"" candidate. This has made the traditionally very conservative 3rd district competitive for Democrats. It shouldn't take a ""fringe"" candidate's election in a primary to make a district competitive. They should always be competitive between the two parties they represent.","I feel that I’ve reached a point in my life where my commitments to my children and family have freed me up to now to be able to devote time and give back to my community. I thought I had reached this point in 2016 when my youngest son graduated high school and was heading to Cal Poly for college but the injury he suffered altered everything. He suffered a C-5/C-6 cervical neck fracture and is now quadriplegic. This injury changed everything for our entire family. His perseverance has pushed him forward and he is now in his senior year at CU Boulder and he has progressed immensely in developing his independence. There are still many challenges for him and my wife and I but I feel that I’m now able to look beyond the world we’ve had to adapt to over these last four years. The challenges we’ve faced have ranged from medical emergencies, to adapting living spaces, navigating government services, and providing reassurances when none seemed possible, all the while maintaining a dental practice that allows me to provide the income needed to overcome the many financial burdens. I’ve needed to juggle so many competing challenges that have made me more pragmatic and empathetic to issues we all must face.",Due to family commitments over the past 4 years I have had little time to volunteer to any organizations outside of career associated groups. My son experienced a cervical neck fracture shortly after graduating from high school in 2016 that left him in a wheel chair and quadriplegic. These last four years have been a challenge for our family and I have devoted all my free time towards helping him achieve the goal of going to CU Boulder and completing college.,"My undergraduate degree was Chemistry and prior to attending Dental School I worked for 3 years as an environmental engineer. I look at any issue I'm faced with through the lens of science and math. I try to learn as much as I can about any issues I'm presented with from as many differing perspectives as I can find and then make informed, calculated decisions as best as I can. I feel my contribution to this commission would be to bring that same mindset to the decisions that these commissions would be responsible to make.","I feel I am a pragmatic, empathetic, practical person always willing to look at issues from differing perspectives. I have built two dental offices over the course of my career, the first involved four dentists with separate practices moving into one common space and the second involving myself and one other practice. Getting us all to agree on certain decisions was always a challenge and I feel I have always been the one most readily to compromise and provide solutions in order to achieve the goal of moving forward and completing the projects.","In past years I've donated to both Republicans and Democrats but since 2015 I have donated only to Democrats including Joe Biden, John Hickenlooper, Jaime Harrison, Jon Ossoff and Amy McGrath. I come from a staunch Republican family from NH but have found the past four years to have been disappointing for Republicans and wish to try to affect real change.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/1136,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/congressional/1136.html

Part of the good in the world is assuring that all citizens in Colorado have a voice and are represented in their vote via fair voting maps.  As an unaffiliated voter, and a fluent speaker of three languages, I firmly believe that people on the commission should represent and be able to try to connect to everyone's experiences within our state, and not just a few.  As a Spanish speaker, I would be one (or hopefully one more?) person on the commission who could reach and communicate with a portion of our population in this state that is often underrepresented.  I also believe that at my core, I have dedicated the bulk of my life to being a problem-solver, to working with all people, and to bettering myself through my education and then sharing this education by helping to educate others.  I believe that these are all skills that would work to the benefit of the commission.","Most of my adult life has been spent raising my family and teaching languages.  I have experience teaching in many different levels -- middle school, high school (including a local alternative school that serves low-income and struggling students), community college and university.  As such, I have had limited time to participate in groups, organizations or associations outside of my sphere of influence.  As a full-time teacher, I have belonged to professional organizations as well as committees within my school district and within my school.  It is within this sphere of influence that I have been most active.  I have led school-level and district-level professional developments, participated in district-wide cohorts, and engaged in committees at the school-level and district-level that advocate for student rights and teacher rights.  As a teacher, I believe that my profession is inherently linked to civil rights and justice in our society, through reflective teaching and guiding our children to think critically about the world they live in. As a teacher, I have dedicated my career towards bringing awareness to underrepresented populations - in particular, second language learners, low-income students, LGBTQ students, and students who don’t feel that they are able to succeed.  As a world language teacher, my life has been dedicated to not only teaching vocabulary and grammar, but also teaching students about how different customs of living, linguistic diversity and social norms influence our own outlook on the world.  At the core of my belief system, I believe that despite these differences, we care about the same problems the world presents us with, and we have the same hopes and dreams for our loved ones.  When we are able to bridge opposing viewpoints, we are able to make progress in our country.","I am a member of Colorado Conference of Foreign Language Teachers (CCFLT) and American Association of Teachers of French (AATF) and American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese (AATSP).  As a member of my school district's union (BVEA) and a building association representative, I have been trained in consensus-building strategies and have worked towards fair practices and positive communication strategies at my building level.","Before I became a teacher, I considered becoming a lawyer.  At this early point in my life, I was faced with the crossroads of choosing one career over the other.  I took the LSAT and applied to law schools at the same time that I applied to graduate schools to study Spanish Literature.  I scored very well on the LSAT (95th percentile), which has a large focus on analytical reasoning, and believe that I would have made a decent lawyer because of my ability to analyze problems from different perspectives.  Instead, I studied for my M.A. and pursued a career as a public school teacher. I have never regretted my decision; I am confronted with an equal number of problems in my chosen profession that I get to seek solutions to on a daily basis (to be fair -- probably far more than if I’d been a lawyer!).  I have honed my problem-solving skills while dealing with the multitude of challenges that teachers face regularly: reaching difficult students; supporting students in emotional need; brainstorming creative ways to present ideas; planning for five different classes a day within 45-minute planning periods; working with limited resources (i.e., no textbooks, spotty technology); interpreting data in order to create a data-driven teaching practice; working in a technology-driven environment (with a sometimes lacking of technology available to students); collaborating in departments with challenging colleagues; working in schools with (sometimes) challenging leaders; etc.  As you can imagine, the list goes on and on.  Every day is a choice to bring myself physically to work for 8-12 hours a day, and to do the best job that I can, in a limited amount of time, with limited resources.  I simply confront problems with a problem-solving mentality, a smile and a positive and friendly attitude, and I work through them in the best way that I can ... and I return and repeat the next day. I would bring the same dedication to problem-solving to my work on this commission.","As an unaffiliated voter, I have spent my life listening to various perspectives in order to keep an open mind and be accepting of all kinds of people.  As a public school teacher, I have spent my life working to educate students and bridge divides in an empathetic manner.  I firmly believe that it's important for people in positions of authority to maintain impartiality; perhaps I do not always agree with the politics of my students or my students' families, but they always deserve to have me (as their teacher) treat them fairly and without partiality in my classroom.  I do have a strong belief system that focuses on women's rights, the future world we are leaving our children, the voting rights that all citizens have;  however, I do not think any of these beliefs make me partisan or partial -- indeed, all of these concerns should be bipartisan and impartial, as they impact everybody.  I've always thought that our societal and global problems are bipartisan; it's the solutions that people turn to that make them partisan.  In the commission, I would strive to be a problem-solver that involves all voices at the table, and all citizens within the state, while striving towards bipartisan solutions.  Also, because my perspective intrinsically is linked to my personal life experiences of being a native of Colorado, but also having lived as a foreigner in other countries, and as an English-speaker who has striven to put herself out of her own realm of experiences in order to become fluent in two other languages, I have a unique perspective with a focus on diversity that I can share with the rest of the commission.","As a native Coloradan, I have voted in every Colorado state and national election since I was 18 years old and consider it a great honor to be able to use my voice in the democratic process.  Since 2015, I have not participated in any campaign as a volunteer, though I have donated money to the campaigns of Hilary Clinton, Joe Biden, and a few political organizations like ActBlue.  Though my political affiliations have recently tended to sway left, I remain unaffiliated as I prefer to keep an open mind and I also view principled conservatism as a cornerstone of our nation's identity.  Since 2015, though I have made these, I remain committed to listening to both sides in a nonpartisan effort to value everybody's opinions, as I believe that all political beliefs have some validity and everybody's voice deserves to be heard.  In the end, every citizen must make a final choice when it comes to voting, and each vote should be represented fairly.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/945,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/congressional/945.html

Let's make things fair for everyone.,"My past employment, before retiring, was with the U.S. Dept of Health & Human Services (HHS). I traveled throughout our state, and the states of Utah, Wyoming, Montana, North and South Dakota. Part of my duties involved working with leaders of the various tribes in these states, to include the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute tribes in the southwestern corner of Colorado. Too often the communities on these two reservations are ignored or forgotten. I hope the Commission will include a representative from one or both of these Colorado tribes.

We turned things around to the point that one of the United Way officials asked to serve on our board of directors.

Certificate in Medical Interpreting.,"Ever since I researched the subject of redistricting and read a book about it, I became aware how important it is that every American’s vote is counted. I have found that one way to disenfranchise a voter’s right to be equally represented is through the unfair drawing of lines along the districts on a map. Example: if you have knowledge of where the minority population resides on a map and you want to keep them from winning the election, you can exert your power by redrawing the lines in a way to keep the minority from winning an election, thereby disenfranchising their right to have their voice heard.

This is what drives me to serve on the commission.  I am a Navajo Indian; I am unique and come from a population that is underserved and underrepresented.  I believe that my input from a diverse perspective is valuable because I would like to make sure people of my race and other minority population have an equal voice through fair mapping.   

My experiences in the community as Vice President of Morgan County Democrats and my background of volunteer work only enhance my drive to serve to make a difference as a member of the redistricting commission.","I can think of a lot of things as an answer to this question, but I would like to focus on my experience advocating, organizing and representing, as a member and acting as the Vice-Chairman of Morgan County Democrats in Colorado. 

When I moved to Fort Morgan, Colorado a few years ago, I found that the Democratic Party was a minority in the community.  Most residents of Fort Morgan belonged to the Republican Party.  As a result, the Democrats felt oppressed. As a leader, I found that this made it difficult for me to get things done.  

Just to place a sign out in the street was risky for fear that the signs would be vandalized. And it did happen. The signs that we placed on the street were immediately vandalized several times.  

Few people wanted to work with us because we were Democrats.  It was difficult to just locate a venue to host an event in the community.  To rent an office to hold our monthly meeting was an enormous task because organizations refused to rent to us.  

Organizing a float in the 4th of July in order to be visible in the community was unheard of.  Few members of the Morgan County Democrats wanted to even ride in the parade for fear of not only ridicule, but the possible physical harm that may come to them. Few wanted to take these risks. The first time we constructed a float, decorated it with huge banners with huge letters of MORGAN COUNTY DEMOCRATS and rode on it in the 4th of July parade, some people ran out in the streets and threw objects at us. Children sprayed water directly on us. But we survived it.  Those people in the audience, who had secretly claimed to be Democrats, were initially apprehensive to cheer and clap for us.  But I noticed that they slowly came around over the years. Each year they saw our Party in the parade, more of them came out to cheer, voicing their appreciation.  

Losing a job was a concern for the members of our organization. They did not want to deal with the repercussions of being revealed that they supported the Democratic Party at their workplace.  I experienced this myself.  I kept a low profile at work.  In this way I identified with the members’ oppressed feelings.  Some must have lost their jobs before I came on the scene.  

Election time seemed to be a stressful time.  Door-knocking was an insurmountable task. No one dared to knock on doors the first year I came to Fort Morgan.   I personally, alone, had to go knock on doors to get the vote out.  Gradually over the years, I got a few more people to muster enough courage to knock on doors with me.  What helped were the stories I wrote up about my experiences knocking on doors and I emailed these to the members of the Democratic Party in the county.  Slowly, more and more people became willing to knock on doors with me. 

With this backdrop of the circumstances, I felt that I had to advocate for who I am and on behalf of my party, not only to the community of Fort Morgan, but to the members themselves in the monthly meetings. There was tremendous discrimination and prejudice against the Democrats in Morgan County. Everything that we valued as a party, like gay rights, women’s right to choose, immigration rights, labor rights, environmental protection values, was held against us.  

Therefore, it took a lot of courage, determination, persistence, and the energy to change the minds of the people.  This I experienced while I organized and represented the Democrats and advocated for them in their community as well as within their own party.","Throughout the summer of 2020, I volunteered by phone and internet for the Navajo Hopi Covid-19 Relief Fund, reaching out to those native people who were affected by Coronavirus. Many lived in the remote areas of the Navajo and Hopi reservations without running water or electricity. A toll-free telephone number was set up where members of their families could call and reach a virtual volunteer, like myself, who took a list of needs like food, water, medical, transportation and cleaning supplies and passed this list on to the ground volunteers who supplied these needs. This was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.  

Since 2015, I have also volunteered for other events like the Thanksgiving dinner for the homeless at the Rise Up Center through the Community of Christ church.

I have participated in the weekly bible study through the Lutheran Church of Our Redeemer.
I have also participated in a different bi-weekly men’s bible study in the Fort Morgan community which included various religious groups.

In 2019, I marched with in annual gay pride parade with Xcel Energy Company.  
Since 2015, I have also volunteered with Xcel Energy to clean up the Barr Lake State Park in Brighton, CO.

When a borrower comes to me for financing, I am required to use all these skills to determine if the borrower will be capable of repaying the money he hopes to obtain.  As the loan officer or mortgage broker, I am the first gatekeeper towards the borrower’s path to obtaining a loan. After analyzing the borrower’s liabilities and assets, I have a duty to make a wise judgment as to whether the loan will close.  This involves gathering data to reveal the picture of the borrower.  I am obligated to input the data accurately into my calculations and verify that the borrower has sufficient income, stable job history, and sufficient reserves to sustain the monthly payment.  I have to determine whether the borrower has the appropriate debt ratio, which is the amount of debt analyzed against the income.  Investigating, verifying, and checking for accuracy are all part of forming the true picture of the borrower. If there are blemishes in the credit history of the borrower, I have the responsibility to determine how the negative credit will impact the borrower’s ability to repay the loan.  Here, my ability to communicate is essential; I am required to draw the information out of the borrower to determine if the bad credit is due to consistent negligence or a one-time event that was beyond the control of the borrower. 

When the case is extremely difficult, I am forced to collaborate with my fellow-loan officers and supervisor to see if the deal is too risky or if we can creatively do the financing. An example is if the property falls within a fine-line definition of real property. Real property is one that is affixed to land.  As a mortgage lender, the only properties I can finance are those that fall within this definition of real property. A questionable type of property is a modular home which used to be a movable property but has since been converted to a property that would be attached to land. The investors who ultimately put up the money to finance the deal may bring up this question at the last minute of closing and the property could be rejected. A good loan officer has this foresight and avoids this probability beforehand.  

Being at the forefront where everything hinges on how well I reveal the true picture of the borrower and how extensive my knowledge is of the loan products are essential as to whether the investor will profit or lose money on the deal of financing a borrower’s request.  How well I have used my analytical skills and how well I have applied my logic and reasoning to solve the initial problems involved in approving a loan will determine the end result of the investment.","As president of a Native American organization, I had a rare opportunity to lead a people that came from two diverse religious beliefs.  One group was of the Christian faith and this group consisted of urban Indians coming from the city lifestyle.  The other group was of the traditional Native American religion which came in from the reservation areas.   I was tempted to cater to one group which had similar beliefs to mine.  But I had to overlook my established way of thinking and become empathetic to those who believed differently than me.  I also noticed that it was easy for one group to turn against the other because they felt, albeit unsubstantiated, there was favoritism demonstrated against them. An example of the diverse of beliefs was how they felt about gay members of the group.  The Christians did not feel that assistance should easily be given to the gay members of the group while the traditional natives had more compassion and respect for the gay members. Though it was a challenge, I had to be fair and impartial. I brought these groups together by promoting consensus by first allowing the members to introduce themselves and to share something unique about themselves.  An important characteristic about the gay members was that they were very artistic.  Most had a talent to perform or to decorate.  This came in very handy when we decided to build a float for an annual parade that had a historical significance to the Native American community.  Our float was featured on television because we brought Native American dancers together to perform on the float.  The Native American motif and design was unique and outstanding.  What resulted from this event was the new respect the gay members gained.  There was a better understanding between the groups and a respect for their diverse uniqueness of the members.  The conservative group became more empathetic to the gay group as well as the traditional native group.  They all started to get along and a much better cohesiveness was created.  As a result, the ability to collaborate on new projects were more easily achieved.

From experiences like this, I feel that I can contribute to the redistricting commission by listening to the different perspectives and points of view, thereby be impartial and  promote consensus among the commissioners.","Most of my past political activity has been with the Morgan County Democratic Party.  I led the way to knocking on doors for the Hillary Clinton campaign.  I made calls to voters.  I spent all day on election day contacting those voters who had not yet voted and following up on those who had not responded by visiting their homes in order to make sure that every voter had voted.  I would like to think that due to my efforts, I have contributed to the victory of Hillary Clinton in the state of Colorado.  

Before the Hillary Clinton elections, I helped Barack Obama win Colorado.  I was fortunate to win the Northeastern CO campaign for the volunteer who had gone the extra mile of knocking on doors and calling on voters.  The winner would have his picture taken with Vice President Joe Biden.  I was so excited to meet and pose in a photo with VP Joe Biden. 

I have been very active with the Morgan County Democratic Party ever since I came to Fort Morgan 14 years ago.  I volunteered to head committees to organize dinners, like our annual Big-Ten dinner, as well as the fall and Christmas dinners.  The task of organizing and planning involved a wide range of tasks.  We had to find a proper venue equipped with a kitchen and a facility to hold enough people for the event.  If the event was a potluck dinner, we had to make sure people brought enough food.   We had to come up with a theme and design an agenda.  We had to solicit help to decorate the venue and clean up the location.  Places that had no sound system was an extra task to find someone to provide a sound system.  Providing entertainment for the dinner involved the task of soliciting musical groups to perform at the event.  In order to run an event according to schedule, it was important to follow up with the speakers and presenters to make sure they had all the information they needed so they could arrive on time.  Finally, one of the most important part of organizing an event was to plan a fund-raising project, like an auction during the dinner, that would be lucrative for the Party. 

Community exposure was one of my objectives as a leader.  I wanted the public to know who we were and what we stood for.  I wanted to make the public feel welcome to our center.  With that in mind, I reached out by introducing myself and the Party whenever events came about in the community.  I made small presentations about our monthly meetings, our frequent get-togethers including dinners and parties and made the public feel at ease with us and helped them realize that we had a lot of positive things to offer.  

I donated $35 dollar every year for the Big-Ten dinners since 2015.  I also donated $30 each to 3 candidates since that time.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/1123,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/legislative/1123.html

Part of the good in the world is assuring that all citizens in Colorado have a voice and are represented in their vote via fair voting maps.  As an unaffiliated voter, and a fluent speaker of three languages, I firmly believe that people on the commission should represent and be able to try to connect to everyone's experiences within our state, and not just a few.  As a Spanish speaker, I would be one (or hopefully one more?) person on the commission who could reach and communicate with a portion of our population in this state that is often underrepresented.  I also believe that at my core, I have dedicated the bulk of my life to being a problem-solver, to working with all people, and to bettering myself through my education and then sharing this education by helping to educate others.  I believe that these are all skills that would work to the benefit of the commission.","Most of my adult life has been spent raising my family and teaching languages.  I have experience teaching in many different levels -- middle school, high school (including a local alternative school that serves low-income and struggling students), community college and university.  As such, I have had limited time to participate in groups, organizations or associations outside of my sphere of influence.  As a full-time teacher, I have belonged to professional organizations as well as committees within my school district and within my school.  It is within this sphere of influence that I have been most active.  I have led school-level and district-level professional developments, participated in district-wide cohorts, and engaged in committees at the school-level and district-level that advocate for student rights and teacher rights.  As a teacher, I believe that my profession is inherently linked to civil rights and justice in our society, through reflective teaching and guiding our children to think critically about the world they live in. As a teacher, I have dedicated my career towards bringing awareness to underrepresented populations - in particular, second language learners, low-income students, LGBTQ students, and students who don’t feel that they are able to succeed.  As a world language teacher, my life has been dedicated to not only teaching vocabulary and grammar, but also teaching students about how different customs of living, linguistic diversity and social norms influence our own outlook on the world.

At this early point in my life, I was faced with the crossroads of choosing one career over the other.  I took the LSAT and applied to law schools at the same time that I applied to graduate schools to study Spanish Literature.  I scored very well on the LSAT (95th percentile), which has a large focus on analytical reasoning, and believe that I would have made a decent lawyer because of my ability to analyze problems from different perspectives.  Instead, I studied for my M.A. and pursued a career as a public school teacher. I have never regretted my decision; I am confronted with an equal number of problems in my chosen profession that I get to seek solutions to on a daily basis (to be fair -- probably far more than if I’d been a lawyer!).  I have honed my problem-solving skills while dealing with the multitude of challenges that teachers face regularly: reaching difficult students; supporting students in emotional need; brainstorming creative ways to present ideas; planning for five different classes a day within 45-minute planning periods; working with limited resources (i.e., no textbooks, spotty technology); interpreting data in order to create a data-driven teaching practice; working in a technology-driven environment (with a sometimes lacking of technology available to students); collaborating in departments with challenging colleagues; working in schools with (sometimes) challenging leaders; etc.  As you can imagine, the list goes on and on.  Every day is a choice to bring myself physically to work for 8-12 hours a day, and to do the best job that I can, in a limited amount of time, with limited resources.  I simply confront problems with a problem-solving mentality, a smile and a positive and friendly attitude, and I work through them in the best way that I can ... and I return and repeat the next day. I would bring the same dedication to problem-solving to my work on this commission.","As an unaffiliated voter, I have spent my life listening to various perspectives in order to keep an open mind and be accepting of all kinds of people.  As a public school teacher, I have spent my life working to educate students and bridge divides in an empathetic manner.  I firmly believe that it's important for people in positions of authority to maintain impartiality; perhaps I do not always agree with the politics of my students or my students' families, but they always deserve to have me (as their teacher) treat them fairly and without partiality in my classroom.  I do have a strong belief system that focuses on women's rights, the future world we are leaving our children, the voting rights that all citizens have;  however, I do not think any of these beliefs make me partisan or partial -- indeed, all of these concerns should be bipartisan and impartial, as they impact everybody.  I've always thought that our societal and global problems are bipartisan; it's the solutions that people turn to that make them partisan.  In the commission, I would strive to be a problem-solver that involves all voices at the table, and all citizens within the state, while striving towards bipartisan solutions.  Also, because my perspective intrinsically is linked to my personal life experiences of being a native of Colorado, but also having lived as a foreigner in other countries, and as an English-speaker who has striven to put herself out of her own realm of experiences in order to become fluent in two other languages, I have a unique perspective with a focus on diversity that I can share with the rest of the commission.","As a native Coloradan, I have voted in every Colorado state and national election since I was 18 years old and consider it a great honor to be able to use my voice in the democratic process.  Since 2015, I have not participated in any campaign as a volunteer, though I have donated money to the campaigns of Hilary Clinton, Joe Biden, and a few political organizations like ActBlue.  Though my political affiliations have recently tended to sway left, I remain unaffiliated as I prefer to keep an open mind and I also view principled conservatism as a cornerstone of our nation's identity.  Since 2015, though I have made these, I remain committed to listening to both sides in a nonpartisan effort to value everybody's opinions, as I believe that all political beliefs have some validity and everybody's voice deserves to be heard.  In the end, every citizen must make a final choice when it comes to voting, and each vote should be represented fairly.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/946,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/legislative/946.html

For too long, the pendulum has swung in favor of one party or the other. There needs to be balance across all aspects of politics in this state. For a population to thrive, it requires a diverse perspective and consideration of all beliefs and opinions.","I do not have any professional experience in community organization. These positions are inherently political and, in my opinion, do not serve to maintain a neutral perspective without bias.","I individually donate and sponsor charitable organizations. This year, I selected Ralston House as a local nonprofit for a chance to win a $25,000 grant. Although they were not ultimately selected, we feel confident that through successive nominations, eventually they will win this grant.

Then, using that perspective, consider how other people might develop an alternate or opposite perspective,  how they would/could arrive at that perspective, and how my decision would/could affect them.","It is rare to find someone that can make a decision that, while it may not benefit them individually, will benefit the whole or vice-versa.

This skill has helped me build a business from scratch to the point where it was recently acquired by a publicly traded company.  I built a customer base, worked with partners, managed employees and collaborated with vendor partners to achieve a success result for whatever specific situation we were working on.
I have a wide network of individuals in a range of areas around our state and am confident I could listen to the various opinions that will be directed at the commission and work with my fellow commissioner to focus on a set of over-arching principals that I would expect we could agree on before we sit down with maps and numbers.
I am eager to apply my talents and energy to help Colorado inaugurate this innovate redistricting process.  I will focus on collaboration and consensus so that we can provide a result to the Citizens of Colorado that meets their aspirations for this new process and provides as level a playing field as possible on which we can conduct our political discussions over the next 10 years.","I have been involved at increasingly senior levels in organizational leadership, advocacy and community conversations for my entire career.
As a citizen of Louisville, I first was involved in designing and implementing a municipal arboretum as a member of what was then known as the Tree Board.  I next worked on the Board of Adjustments to listen to Citizen’s application for variances from our zoning codes to accommodate their specific property issues and aspirations.  As a two-term member City Council, I had the opportunity to work with a wide spectrum of the community on a variety of issues spanning power lines, residential and commercial development, school location, power line relocation, extra-municipality communications and many more.
As I look back, my favorite subjects where looking at long-term, region wide collaboration and planning opportunities.  As a member of the Boulder County Consortium of Cities, I spearheaded an effort to explore sharing of sales taxes to reduce redundant commercial development and to share library and recreation facilities.  As a member of the DRCOG Board, I worked with a wide-variety of stakeholders from other local governmental bodies to prioritize local and regional transportation issues and to manage the MetroVision Plan’s urban growth boundary.  This required balancing the needs and priorities our Louisville citizens with the more aggressive development interests of other communities in the metro Denver area.
I also have served on multiple non-profit boards and commissions.  My latest work with the Imagine! Foundation and the Imagine! governing board has taught me about the world of individuals with intellectual and development disabilities and allowed me to take that message to our community so that we can continue to implement a world of opportunities for all abilities.  
Even as  private citizen and as a Mayoral candidate last year, I became reacquainted with the local political scene – rekindling old friendships and meeting new citizens.  I got involved with a dispute between a group of neighbors and a individual who was redeveloping an older Louisville home and was able to help them reach a consensus on how to move forward.  I also worked with the team that was seeking to develop the old StorageTech property along US36 to help them express their message to the community so that we could find a way to ensure that Medtronic reinvested in our great community.
I have been involved in our civic, non-profit, and business community my entire adult life.  I have a wide network of individuals in a range of areas around our state and am confident I could listen to the various opinions that will be directed at the commission and work with my fellow commissioner to focus on a set of over-arching principals that I would expect we could agree on before we sit down with maps and numbers.","Imagine!

As part of that degree, I took many classes that required the synthesis of multiple concepts and sources.  Whether learning the more analytical but theoretical concepts of micro and macro economics, to the intricacies of money and banking to the abstract historical concepts that can be gleaned from Economic History. 
After Northwestern, I worked in the restaurant industry for two years learning customer service and management of a business.
Finally, in Law School, we learned to study the facts and the law and apply these concepts to achieve outcomes that achieved some sort of justice for our clients.
In my business career, I have developed skills of managing budgets, building and managing to proforma projections, managing cashflows all while attempting to ensure that we were developing our software efficiently and getting our message out to potential customers in a compelling fashion.
I am not an engineer.  However, I understand Colorado geography.  I am familiar with the range of constituencies throughout our State.  I also understand the requirements that we draw maps that encompass the required populations numbers in a manner that encourages competitive races so that all citizens are represented.  
I have worked my entire adult life to resolve legal, municipal, neighborhood, and organizational challenges by spending time to learn the facts, understanding the underlying framework within which we  are working, gaining stakeholder input and, most importantly fostering a consensus building environment where, whenever possible, the stakeholders themselves are able to achieve a mutually agreement resolution.  I look forward to applying that same philosophy to the redistricting commission.","My strategy would be to first spend time with my fellow commissioner to:
•	ensure that we all understand the laws, rules, and procedures that we must adhere to;
•	understand the perspective, goals and aspirations of my fellow commissioners; and;
•	Agree on a set of aspirational goals that we share as commissioners that we can refer back to when we find ourselves attempting to resolve the eventual differences of opinion that will arise.
In these times where we see and experience many examples of uncivil actions in our public and private arenas, it is critical that we focus first on what we can agree on so that we have touchstones that we can revisit when we have subsequent disagreements.  
These boards must aspire to be examples of civility, creativity and action so that we can deliver a result to the people of Colorado that enables our citizens to engage meaningfully on the issues, policies and candidates that we will encounter over the next 10 years.","I served as a Councilman in the City of Louisville from January 2000 through December of 2007.

legislative,1142,2020-10-31T22:19:42Z,Adelia Tripp,"Adelia Tripp-Morris, Adelia Tripp-Sena, Dawn Tripp, Dawn Tripp-Sena, Adelia Dawnene Tripp",Democrat,female,f,African American or Black,False,81005,"Director of Social Work Department, Colorado Mental Health Institute @ Pueblo","Bachelors degreee Social Work, Masters degree Social Work, Licensed Clinical Social Worker, (LCSW)","I would love to serve on the commission because I am passionate about equality, equity and justice. I am the kind of person that considers all sides and fairness is one of my core values. I have been able to use my skills at CMHIP with positive results for 10 years now; being on a committee where my work will have a positive effect on all Coloradoans and the citizens of  USA would be a dream come true!","As the director of Social Work department my mission is many-fold. I am in the position to advocate for better working conditions and salaries for my staff, advocate for the patients to ensure their rights are not being violated and advocate for the patients’ social supports such that they are treated with dignity and respect when they call to see how their loved one is doing in our custody.
I have been a member of Colorado WINS, where I took these issues and came up with a strategy to get a salary increase for Social Workers in the Colorado Department of Human Services (CDHS). I worked on this for 8 years without tiring, even though I would not get an increase myself. Because of my advocacy large salary increases came to all the Social Workers in the CDHS in July 2018! These were not regular raises but compression pay that raised the Social Workers pay to be competitive with the Department of Corrections and the private sector. 
I was on the Executive Steering Committee for the collaboration between employees at CMHIP and Executive management at CDHS for 4 years. Being elected to this committee by the employees at CMHIP gave me the opportunity and put me in a position to speak to executive staff at CDHS regarding the need for compression pay for the Social Workers.","I am a member of the NAACP, Colorado WINS, National Association of Social Workers, and Association of Black Social Workers. I am also a member of the Daughters of Promise a group of women who sing at different fundraisers and vigils for different  causes, i.e., immigration, voting suppression and other current events/issues.","One of my responsibilities as the director of the Social Work department is to ensure that every patient has a Social Worker per Centers for Medicaid/Medicare regulations. At one point the department was down 50% (14 staff) and I had to figure out how we were going to cover 494 patients with half of a department. I was able to implement a plan with the buy in of the Social Workers until we were able to hire more staff. 
The main reason for the loss of Social Workers was salary. Most of these Social Workers left CMHIP to work for the Veterans Administration because they offered a better salary and working conditions. The conclusion I came to was if we increased salaries to a competitive wage, we would have fewer resignations. Fewer resignations would be cost effective for the company because we would not be constantly spending money to train new staff.
Being a member of the Executive Steering Committee representing CMHIP, I had to present issues in a way that the Executives at CDHS would be open to hearing the issues and the solutions provided. Being elected to this committee by the employees at CMHIP gave me the opportunity and put me in a position to speak to executive staff on a regular basis regarding the need for compression pay for the Social Workers. This was one of the last items CDHS supported in the legislature before their 2nd term was completed. Recruitment and retention have increased since compression pay was implemented with only 2 resignations in the last 2.5 years.","This is exactly what the profession of Social Work does. Social Workers looks to right injustices, advocate for victims, community advocates for change. I have wanted to be a Social Worker since I was 5 years old, it's in my blood. As I stated in my statement above fairness is one of my core values. Though I am not applying for a Social Work position I believe my experience as a Social Worker makes me an excellent candidate for the commission.","I donate monthly to ActBlue, I have donated several times recently to the Biden/Harris campaign. I donate monthly to PushBlack and Colorado WINS/COPE. I have been a moderator for question and answer sessions of political candidates that wanted to be endorsed by Colorado WINS.

Community service is extremely important to me. I have always served my community in some capacity wherever I have lived.  As a child and grandchild of immigrants, I have always felt it is my duty to contribute to democratic establishments in the United States.  Serving on the Commission would give me an opportunity to represent the interests of rural Western Colorado and at the same time different constituencies that are important to the vibrance of Colorado – ranchers, small businesses, tourist economies, the ski industry, parents and schools.  I feel my voice will be valuable to the Commission because I am a good listener, I have intellectual curiosity to learn more and I am fair and polite when working with others who do not share my values.  I did not learn English until I went to kindergarten and I am the first person in my family to attend college. I have lived in cities and now in a rural area.  I am the mother of two adopted children from Kazakhstan and I now consult for my home county on COVID-19 response.  All these diverse experiences will allow me to help the process of creating fair maps, which are instrumental for future voting and representation at the federal and legislative level.",I worked for two years to advocate for a school bond in Steamboat Springs meeting many community groups in the area.  I now work for Routt County providing information on COVID-19.,"Since 2015 -- I am a board member of Routt County United Way, Routt County Integrated Community, Chair of the Steamboat Springs High School Parent Information Committee, Community Committee for Education (CC4E).","Throughout my professional career, I have had to use my analytical and critical thinking skills in a variety of situations.  I am skilled in strategic communications, coalition building and partnerships, change management, influencing public policy, training, and coaching leaders and staff to reach their optimal potential. I have developed strategic plans for non-profits and government programs like First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move initiative and the Department of Defense’s Healthy Base Initiative to improve nutrition and increase physical activity at military installations.  I have collaborated with many types of constituencies. For example, although I never served in the military, I worked with leaders at the Pentagon and local military installations in the U.S. to improve nutritional options.  Speaking three languages has also attuned me to listen and gather information about different cultures.  I am comfortable researching different issues, brainstorming, collaborating, developing budgets, analyzing options and communicating with different types of audiences.","Throughout my career, I have had to build consensus and agreement.  I have found that setting clear expectations is the first step in building consensus.  In addition, using techniques like developing SMART (specific, measurable, actionable, realistic and timebound) goals helps focus teams on what we are trying to achieve instead of personalities, tactics or disagreements. I have numerous examples of practicing empathy and collaborating with others with different opinions.  From 2000-2004, I worked in Greece for the Athens Olympic Organizing Committee setting up the International Media office and supervising media strategy and operations.  Aside from working in an environment where I was usually the only women at senior staff meetings, I managed many Greek staff with very different levels of experience and understanding of how to work in an international environment.  My way of working with them was to always be direct, honest, share information and focus on the ultimate goals.  Along the way, I taught them as many skills as I could on how to handle top level sports reporters from around the world. One of my most enduring legacies is the number of Greek staff that now serve in leadership positions in Greece, England, and Australia and how they credit me with giving them the foundation to working on teams and at a high level of expectations.  In addition, locally in Steamboat Springs, I worked on the Community Committee for Education (CC4E) which was created after a failed bond initiative. Our diverse committee spanned many different perspectives from old time rancher/bankers to restaurant owners to mothers who volunteered in the schools.  We did not come from the same perspectives, but I believe my leadership and communications skills led to a strong proposal that was presented to and supported by 28 community groups in Steamboat Springs.  Even when discussions were heated, I was always open to suggestions and ways that we could move forward as a committee.","I have worked on presidential campaigns in 1988, 1992, 1996 and 2000.  I worked in the Clinton Administration and Obama Administration from 2010-2011.

Problems can arise from all sorts of angles and it’s my job to anticipate and mitigate those potential issues. In my brewing career, problems were often more acute and required immediate, effective action to resolve. There is little time to deliberate when an enormous tank is leaking, and so I developed a quick response time to problems that does not compromise the effectiveness of the solution. In my academic training, I built a foundation of logical and reasoned analysis since the field of chemistry tolerates no other type of analysis. In my leisure time, I’m always eager to learn a new board game or puzzle because they help me think about strategic problem solving in a new light. Tasks like the Commission’s are a good fit for me.","I have found success throughout my personal and professional life in guiding meetings and conversations to a place that promotes consensus. I once managed a 30-person team of graduate student volunteers, which is a fragile coalition to hold together since students always have competing interests for their time and, being volunteers, I could offer them no material incentives. I was ultimately able to keep the group engaged, and on this and other teams I have relied upon a few key building blocks to set the stage for productive collaboration.


First, confirm goals and check assumptions. Do we have a common understanding of our purpose? Are there facts we all recognize? Many disagreements can be forestalled by establishing a baseline of goals and information that the entire group accepts.


Second, match outcomes to goals. What does success look like? Does this hypothetical result comport with our mission? Why or why not? Holding up possible outcomes for consideration helps ground the group in the reality of their decisions.


Third, connect actions to outcomes. If we take this step, will it lead to the result we want? The result that we agree will help achieve our goals? Actions can be more easily agreed upon if their connections to prior points of consensus are made clear; it is also important to deliberately give proposed actions a reality check for unintended consequences.


Half the battle (at least) of gathering consensus from a diverse group lies in simply avoiding derailment, since tangents constantly threaten to intrude and have a tendency to build their own momentum once instigated. Furthermore, it is crucial to follow good evidence wherever it leads and to be an active listener who strives to hear the truth in the experiences of one’s peers. These steps, attitude, and adherence to evidence are crucial ingredients for impartiality and consensus-building, and I believe a good process leads to good outcomes. While a harmonious ending is never guaranteed, these factors maintain a focus on the right questions and lead to the right conversations. I will strive to foster this collaborative process on the Commission.","Small amounts (<$150) to:

During my time at CDC, I was routinely called upon for special assignments – establishing high-profile programs, leading rapid decision-making units during pandemics, rescuing and rehabilitating programs decimated by political budget cuts. After retirement, I committed to myself that I would use those skills and that passion to help find solutions in my own community and state, rather than just at the Federal government level. I have long been interested in Congressional processes. During my time at CDC, I had the privilege to meet regularly with members of Congress and their staffs to educate them about our programs and answer their questions. I love the idea of democratic representation and finding ways to make that representation really work. Spending the bulk of my career living in a state that was heavily gerrymandered (Georgia) was exceptionally frustrating and something I vowed to take seriously when I was free of the Hatch Act restrictions I was placed under as a Federal uniformed services officer. When I retired and moved to Colorado in 2016, I knew I was moving to a state with many fewer Congressional districts, and that the population size and distribution was the largest determinant of how those districts are structured. The degrees of freedom for creating districts are extremely limited because of this. But the issues facing voters in CO-3 – one of the largest geographical districts in the nation with a relatively small population – must be considered and forcefully advocated for during the redistricting analysis and decision-making. I want to represent that perspective while also recognizing that the commission must make the best decisions for the good of the entire state. I want to apply my analytic, strategic, and negotiation skills to this big, difficult challenge to help the commission succeed in its work.","Upon moving to Colorado, I became an active member of 4 volunteer music organizations – the Cowboy Corral, Symphony in the Valley, the Aspen Choral Society, and High Country Sinfonia. In each, my goal was to serve as an outstanding musical contributor. With Aspen Choral Society and High Country Sinfonia, I quickly became more deeply involved in the organizational and business aspects through appointments to the Boards of Directors. I joined the Board of the Aspen Choral Society at a time when many important organizational changes were occurring. I quickly recognized that the Board would benefit from having the bylaws updated and a more aggressive public relations and fundraising posture. I led the revision of the bylaws, facilitated the entire board in reviewing and discussing options for important changes, identified a volunteer to serve as our general counsel for review and advice, and assisted the Board President with socializing and approving the new bylaws among the full board. I also worked closely with a public relations contractor to develop press releases and a more active social media presence. Behind the scenes, I provide guidance to the Board President based on my previous experience and training as a member of a board for a large national organization. High Country Sinfonia appointed me to their Board in 2020 to assist with their efforts to become a registered non-profit organization in the state of Colorado. That work is ongoing and draws from my experience developing the bylaws and procedures for Aspen Choral Society. My approach to organizing, representing, and advocating for both organizations is to serve the three “duties” of a board member – duty of care, duty of loyalty, and duty of obedience. My aim is to improve their business operations through careful shifts in policy and activity, while honoring the long local traditions of each organization and the deep relationships among and between the long-standing members, board members, and the community members who are our donors and audiences. A second way I actively consider the interests of Colorado organizations is my professional consulting work in public health and strategic planning. I have worked with several governmental organizations or associated entities within Pitkin County including the Board of County Commissioners, the Department of Public Health, the Aspen Pitkin County Housing Authority, and the Pitkin County Elected Officials Transportation Committee (including the Pitkin BoCC, the Aspen City Council, and the Snowmass Village Town Council). In each engagement, I have strived to build rapport, guide the group to a strategic solution, and identify and resolve areas of disagreement all while adhering to the parameters provided by the sponsor/client. This work has given me deep insight into the political structures, realities, and foibles of the government entities within one county and, critically, how those entities relate to their neighboring counties of the Roaring Fork Valley.","• American College of Preventive Medicine (a 501c3 national professional medical society, member since 1996; Fellow since 2004; Board of Regents President-Elect 2017-2019, President 2019-2021, CEO Search/Selection Committee Chair 2018) • US Public Health Service Commissioned Officers Association (member, 1991 - present) • Aspen Mountain View Homeowners Association (homeowner, 2016-present) • Aspen Choral Society (singer and member of the Board of Directors, 2017-present) • Eagle County CO Democrats (volunteer, 2020) • Symphony in the Valley (Glenwood Springs, CO, musician, 2016-2019) • High Country Sinfonia (Basalt, CO, musician 2017-present, board member 2020-present) • Valley Gardeners (Carbondale, CO, member 2017-present) • Cowboy Corral (singer, 2016-2019)","Medical and public health academic work and applied General Preventive Medicine and Public Health medical residency training all focus on analytic skills. I have an extensive background in conducting analytic studies documented by my publication record (see CV). As a supervisor and manager, I was also responsible for reviewing and approving analytic studies using numerous statistical data sets (including census data). In approaching problems of all kinds, I first look to the available data, seek other sources of information, and apply the strategic negotiation and planning skills described above to best analyze, generate options, and solve a problem.","In my facilitation and strategic planning work, I use several techniques to promote consensus. Chief among these is to ask questions to make sure I fully understand the perspective and contribution of the group members. I also make sure that I carefully draw out both the explicit and implicit criteria people are using to make decisions so that I can find areas where negotiation is possible. I always try to understand my own and others’ self-interests. I also work to reframe conflicts – what is it we already agree on? How can we use those points of agreement to find solutions to meet the enlarged interests of the group – in this case the entire state? When disagreement continues it is usually because the “right” solution has yet to be found. Being creative and drawing on the entire group’s creativity is key. And finally, I aim to always articulate how the group came to its recommendation or solution and what the criteria were. This contributes directly to communications that generate buy-in among stakeholders and so that each member of the commission can faithfully and enthusiastically promote the results of the work. My training as a scientist, manager and leader and my experience in the highly politicized environment of Federal public health instilled in me the need for fairness and impartiality. One cannot lead a team without being fair. Serving as the steward of a Federal budget requires one to be impartial. Federal procurement rules build fairness and impartiality directly into the systems within which I was trained. It is my instinct – through disposition and training – to make decisions based on facts, after considering the pros and cons of all the options, while making the decision criteria explicit, and with a deep understanding of how all stakeholders will feel about the decision. Finally, the most important aspect of promoting consensus and contributing to a fair, impartial and agreeable process is getting to know and appreciate the perspectives of my fellow commissioners. Learning about each other – including who we are and what we value – will be key to the commission’s success.","During a 25-year career as a Federal uniformed services medical officer (1991-2016), my political activity was limited due to Hatch Act restrictions. Following my retirement (September 1, 2016), I participated in house-to-house canvassing during the 2016 general election. During the 2018 election, I did a small amount of letter writing for the Diane Mitsch Bush campaign (CO-3). During 2020, I have participated in the Eagle County Democratic Caucus and as a district/state delegate in March, served as an Eagle County citizen election judge during the June primary, and briefly volunteered for and participated in one meeting of the Eagle County Democrats this summer.

As I wind down these consulting activities, I plan to serve as a citizen election judge again for the general election in November.

At the University of Colorado, I implemented a new program to promote graduate level work by students underrepresented at the graduate level, and coordinated the efforts of faculty committees in grant awards for their peers.  For the city of Boulder, I provided the staff leadership for a task force of members of the development community advising the city on a new development review and structure of fees for services.  For BVSD, I organized activities and advocated for students with special needs, and for ""I Have a Dream"" I was able to practice all these skills as I coordinated with more than 100 community partners to match resources with children and families.  In addition, I served on a preschool advisory board, many parent committees, and have volunteered to promote and celebrate diversity.","""I Have a Dream"" Foundation of Boulder County, Dream Big Task Force, Casa de Paz Colorado, City of Boulder task force to consider redevelopment of Washington Elementary School site, BVSD committee for renovation of Casey Middle School, and Boulder’s Community Foundation.  More recently, I participated in the Forever Indivisible community action group to learn about local and national issues, hear directly from representatives/candidates, and take action in my areas of interest.  I am both a volunteer and a sponsor (financial contributor) for the ""I Have a Dream"" Foundation of Boulder County, and a contributor and volunteer with Casa de Paz -  assisting newly released detainees, from the ICE center in Aurora, reunite with their families.  The Dream Big Task Force was a collective effort among government and nonprofit agencies to explore opportunities to provide educational and mentoring resources to more of the students living in poverty in Boulder County.","My education and professional experience were in these exact areas.

Throughout my career, I worked to build consensus and to draw upon the strengths and expertise of all involved, recognizing that the best outcomes are always the result of teamwork, respect, and diversity. Again, my entire career was spent analyzing systems, designing and managing projects, and providing leadership that ensured the meaningful participation of all stakeholders.","I have extensive experience, both professional and personal, in team-building and promoting consensus.

It may seem like an abstract or incidental process, but it is absolutely essential to the correct functioning of our republic as well as fairness to the public.

Furthermore, incorrect districting leaves many with no voice in their government; politicians should not be allowed to pick the people they serve. It is absolutely critical that politicians serve the people who reside in their neighborhoods and districts as they naturally stand.
Moreover, I am extremely interested in maps, cartography, and geography - all things that are closely tied to redistricting. When I was an undergraduate at the University of Denver, I was the research assistant for Dr. John Livingston, chair of the Department of History. In this capacity I poured over maps with him as we analyzed geographic information that he needed for his scholarly writings. Eventually I was made curator of the map and slide collections for the Department of History, a job that I absolutely loved.

This love of maps has served me well in other capacities as well. As a Social Studies teacher for my entire career, geography was a cornerstone of the curricula I taught. Additionally, this propelled me to become a National Geographic certified teacher, which required a rigorous process of online learning, collaboration with a cohort of National Geographic staff and other educators, design and implementation of lesson plans, collaboration with colleagues, and creation of a capstone project. In addition to that, I was chosen by National Geographic from an international pool of applicants to attend their Summer Institute for a week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. This week entailed intense training in geographic issues, including redistricting. At the conclusion of this workshop, the participants were tasked with training other teachers on the National Geographic framework for educators. This framework includes a commitment to diversity, collaboration, helping students become active citizens, and empathy for all who share our planet. I was able to lead the middle school where I worked through this process during a day of staff development that met with great success. Although the pandemic has brought this collaboration to a temporary halt, I fully intend to continue training other teachers and helping them earn their National Geographic certification as well.

Last and perhaps most importantly, I want to give back to my community. As a recently-retired teacher, I do not want to spend the rest of my life loafing or resting on my laurels. Civic engagement is a core component of who I am and one of the primary reasons I chose to teach Social Studies, rather than any other subject, for my career. Serving as a redistricting commissioner would allow me to continue to engage in very important matters, but in a different capacity. I would be extremely honored to be considered for this position.","As a founding member of NASTAP (Native American Sacred Trees and Places), I have been heavily involved in preserving, interpreting, and educating the public about historic and archaeological sites on both public and private lands in Colorado.This group is dedicated to identifying, interpreting, and preserving important Native American cultural sites. Additionally, we have been able to collaborate with members of the Southern Ute Reservation who have helped this group interpret important sites and communicate their importance to land-owners, public land administrators and other stake-holders. Even more importantly, NASTAP has been involved in bringing Ute youth from the reservation back to their ancestral lands along the front range. I have participated in numerous capacities with these young people in roles ranging from cook to video session moderator. NASTAP holds an annual conference that includes Ute youth, and provides an all-expenses-paid trip to the conference for Ute youth and elders. Additionally, this group funds the research of Dr. James Jefferson, a Ute elder who holds a PhD in linguistics, is the president of NASTAP, and carries out field research throughout Colorado. The work of this group is extremely important to me because of my family’s dedication to preserving Ute and Comanche sites found on my mother’s ranch and also because of the importance of Native Americans to our nation’s history and culture. And, on a personal level, I have learned a tremendous amount from the Native Americans, especially the elders, who participate in the group.

Another group that I have advocated for in a variety of ways is new teachers and teacher candidates. As an experienced teacher working with a high percentage of diverse and at-risk students, I felt that I needed to pass on the knowledge I had gained throughout my career. I served in the official capacity of mentor for many years as part of the Colorado Department of Education’s licensing requirement for new teachers. I have also had seven student teachers and have helped all of them gain their Colorado teaching certificates. Helping forge new teachers involves a variety of skills, with empathy being one of the most important. For example, one of my student teachers was involved in a program through UCCS that helped former military members become teachers. This person was a Marine who had seen front-line action in Iraq, had lost several members of his unit in combat, had sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and a broken hip. Needless to say, there were days when he needed a great deal of support from me, which I was more than willing to provide. At one point he needed a break away from the rigors of teaching, and so I house-sat for him and took care of his dogs so that he could take a much-needed break. I was also able to diffuse a tricky situation with a parent who was unhappy with my student teacher simply by drawing out her empathy. Patience, collaboration, and clear communication are other skills that are very necessary for working with those just entering the teaching field.

Additionally, I brought the National Geographic Geography Bee to Skyview Middle School; this is an international competition, similar to the National Spelling Bee, which encourages students to become well-versed in geographic fundamentals and concepts. I was able to persuade the principal to foot the bill for this activity and then became the building coordinator. In this capacity I was able to help formulate teams throughout the school and oversee the implementation of the competition. At the end of the competition, one student emerges as the school winner and is then able to compete at higher levels. Being the coordinator of this project for a building of more than seventy faculty members and over 1200 students helped me use my organizational and collaboration skills. I was particularly pleased to see that I build a robust organization that continues at Skyview even though I retired at the end of last school year.

Another organization that I worked with at Skyview Middle School was Knowledge Bowl. I was the co-sponsor of this activity, which consisted of daily practices with a team of sixth-graders followed by competition at a regional event. My team placed in the top three teams at the regional finals every year that I coached them and provided an excellent opportunity for our gifted and talented students to participate in an intellectual event while developing social ties with other gifted students. Advocating for advanced students continues to be one of my passions as they are a group that is often underfunded and underserved.","As a classroom teacher, I have belonged to the National Education Association (NEA), the Colorado Education Association (CEA), the Pikes Peak Education Association (PPEA), and the Falcon Teachers Association (FTA) for thirty-five years, from 1985 to the present.  These groups advocate for public schools and public school children in a variety of different ways. I have participated with the groups by not only being a member, but by also serving on outreach committees to advocate for new teachers.

Additionally, I have been very active in 4-H, a group that provides leadership training and other skills to youngsters aged six to eighteen. As a child I was involved as a member and as an adult I have been a leader at the Kit Carson 4-H club where I was able to mentor children and young adults who were involved in the poultry and leadership programs. This meant preparing for the state and county fairs and resulted in my club bringing home many prizes including Stockman of the Year, Grand Champion, Bird of Show and many other awards. Through this process I was able to help students grow in terms self-confidence, empathy, creativity, and collaboration.

Further, I hold membership in NCHE, the National Council of History Educators. I was honored to be chosen to present at the NCHE conference in Richmond, Virginia as a representative of the Teaching American History grant (TAH). I moderated a session at this conference as well as submitted a peer-reviewed video I created on the importance of the horse to Plains Indians culture. The theme of that year’s conference was, “Recounting Emancipation: Women, Circumstance and Jazz.” This event brought together educators from throughout the United States as well as from abroad, and we were able to meet to discuss continuing the work of emancipation by building on the legacy of the past.

Additionally, the Teaching American History grant was a multiple-year program that I participated in, geared to improving the civic engagement of public school students. TAH stressed the importance of critical thinking, creativity, leadership, and collaboration in teaching School Studies, and also identified these as measures of success for students in Social Studies classes throughout Colorado. As part of this program, I was instructed by university professors, historians, authors, and other professionals. I was also able to collaborate with and learn from some of the best teachers throughout the Pikes Peak region. As a result of this program, Social Studies instruction has dramatically changed. No longer is this discipline one of rote memorization of names and dates—it is now a vibrant field dedicated to building skills including critical analysis, creativity, and civic action.","Using, developing, and fostering the use of logic, analysis, and reason, rather than emotion, is very important to me. Teaching Social Studies is, in fact, instructing students in the development of analytical skills, logic, and reason. I was one of the first teachers at Skyview Middle School to bring the use of document-based questions (DBQ’s) to the middle school. This pedagogy involves teaching students to read and analyze primary source documents and then apply that knowledge to answer open-ended questions. Unfortunately, this strategy often is limited to high school instruction, something that I was determined to end and—I am happy to report—that when I retired from Skyview Middle School, most, if not all Social Studies teachers were using this instructional strategy. So, I have had a great deal of experience in not only using logic, analytical skills, and reason, but also in teaching its use to other teachers as well as middle school students.

Additionally, I have more than ninety post-graduate recertification, college, and CDE credits. This is far beyond what is required to maintain my Colorado teaching license. I have chosen to spend a great deal of my time furthering my education, especially in the areas of critical thinking, applying logic, and problem solving. One example of this is that I have accrued many credit hours from the Bill of Rights Institute, an organization that promotes clear-headed thinking and teaching about the US Constitution. I will continue to pursue professional and personal development through continuing education classes, despite my retirement from the education field.

One of the activities that has helped me hone my analytical skills is debate. While I was in high school I was on the debate team and proudly brought home many trophies for participation in both cross- examination debate and extemporaneous speaking. When I began teaching at Sierra HIgh School, I volunteered to be the assistant debate coach. Both the participation and coaching of this logic-based activity helped me develop critical thinking skills and also the ability to see the merit in both sides of an issue. The structure of competitive debate is that all participants argue both sides of an issue, so it is important that facts and logic—rather than biases or passions—rule the day. Similarly, in extemporaneous speaking, a random issue is given to the competitor who then has twenty minutes to prepare a speech over the topic to present to judges. These issues usually relate to current events and, again, the use of logic, reason, and analytical thinking rule the day with the judges.

In short, being selected for this commission would be the culmination of much of my life’s work. My recently completed career in education, in addition to my own ever-continuing education, have given me the analytical skills, steady-handed leadership in teamwork, and ability to apply logic and reason to make me an excellent candidate for this very consequential redistricting commission. I thank you for your consideration.","Fairness is a value that is very important to me and is why I became a teacher in schools with a high percentage of at-risk, poor, and disadvantaged students. I felt that it was very important that these youth receive an excellent education, and I was determined to provide this to the best of my ability and I pursued this throughout my thirty-five year career in education. This is the same spirit that I would bring to the redistricting committee.

Additionally, I have had a great deal of experience with building consensus. With the exception of my college years, I have always lived in rural areas. This has resulted in me having quite different political views than my neighbors. However, this has also led me to being very open-minded and objective on many levels. It is impossible to live in a community and be at odds with its members, so I have learned to carefully listen to varied opinions while gently yet firmly sharing my own ideas. This process is a careful balancing act, but it results in harmonious relationships and community building.

Similarly, I have had a wealth of experience with consensus building in my job as a public school teacher. This position brings with it a variety of stakeholders from students and parents, administrators, the Board of Education, the community, and others. Navigating this labyrinth of conflicting ideas, agendas, and backgrounds has led me to understand the importance of holding true to one’s own values while also incorporating the views and ideas of others.
Pursuant to my quest for fairness and opportunity for all, I have also participated in the Educating Children of Color Conference, held at Colorado College, every year since its inception. This conference emphasizes the important role played by teachers in helping children of color obtain an excellent education, and features nationally recognized speakers and thinkers on this topic. Again, I was able to bring new ideas back to my school and other teachers at the conclusion of each of these workshops.","I have always been very involved in politics on  the local and state level. For this election cycle I have written to registered  voters encouraging them to get out and vote. Additionally, I have been involved in phone banking  to help folks formulate a plan for actually voting. I have also participated in door-to-door canvassing in Colorado Springs on weekends and after work. I find this work extremely rewarding. Additionally, I have acted as an election judge on several previous elections. Furthermore, I always attend the caucuses and have stood for a candidate at several of these. This grassroots political activity is very important to me and is, I feel, the lifeblood of our democracy. I fully intend to continue my political activity in the future.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/1354,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/legislative/1354.html

I believe that every person running for office owes the voters a clear explanation of why they should be elected or re-elected.  That means creating districts that are competitive or more nearly competitive.  I think that is what the voters of Colorado voted for and why the commission exists.  I also very strongly believe in the power of cognitive diversity.  Challenges are overcome by leveraging the power of the different ways in which different people see the world, solve problems and make predictions.  Cognitive diversity is not the same as identity diversity (diversity based on race, gender, etc.), but it does correlate with it.  The challenge is to actually put cognitive diversity to work.  That's hard.  I've tried and both failed and succeeded as a VP with Boeing and with my own LLC here in Colorado.  It takes positive leadership to most effectively address problems and challenges, not directive-ship.  For example, extroverts are important to a good team (as important as introverts), but one extrovert, uncontrolled, can destroy the cognitive strength of a team.  I want to serve because I've spent well over a decade learning and understanding cognitive diversity and over fifty years as a leader, both in government and industry.  I want to help bring cognitive diversity to the challenge and to help leverage the diversity of the team.  I can be equally effective as a team member or as a team leader.","As a member of various Lafayette, Colorado, boards, committees and Councils, I have actively represented the interests of, those people that I consider pragmatists.  I take the position that it is all well and good to support lofty goals, but it is more important to support those goals that are actually achievable.  I have found that a common human failing is committing to some initiative without considering how the people involved in or affected by the initiative will actually respond to that initiative.  Human beings behave in ways that satisfy their personal goals and well being - not the ways in which councils, commissions, boards and legislatures want them to behave.  I participate in boards and commissions by encouraging my colleagues to engage in thorough discussions of the basic goal and how to achieve that goal. I don't believe in attacking or challenging the ideas of others, but I do believe in asking “why” and “how” questions to get to the very root of the idea and the potential ramifications and consequences of implementing it.  Why do we want to say/do that?  Does saying that commit us to some course of action?  If so, what?  How will we achieve such and such goal?  What are the measures that will help us understand whether or not we're making progress toward the goal?  What is the benefit to the citizens?  People are reasonable when they take the time to approach a task cognitively vs. intuitively   I believe that I am aligned with intent of the recent ballot initiative to re-draw Colorado’s legislative districts.  In redrawing Colorado’s legislative districts, it is vitally important to work from the basis that the goal is the creation of districts that are most fair to the voters in each of those districts – not to make the districts the same “size” or to ensure that they are homogeneous.  Competitive districts are fairer because candidates must actually engage voters and present their “platforms” and philosophies of government and allow the voters to choose.","Lafayette, CO Senior Advisory Board since 2018 Currently Vice Chairman

The trick, of course is to separate the facts from the junk.  As an engineer and a flight-test lead, it was imperative that I was able to conduct my own analysis and to understand the analyses of others.  That meant having a working knowledge of probability and statistics as well as an understanding of the limits of sampling and extrapolation.  It also means having an appreciation for the power of analytic theories like Bayesian probability.  While I'm certainly no expert in Bayesian probability (or statistics), I understand the concepts, can work with them, and understand (most importantly) their limitations.  

As the Boeing VP for Analysis, Modeling, Simulation and Experimentation, I led a global team of analysts and successfully applied analysis to successfully win new business.  I had to both understand the analysts and to explain their findings and recommendations to the most senior levels of the Boeing company.","I have always strongly disliked the idea of consensus -- consensus is the answer that everyone can live with, and that's usually the “least bad” solution.  What we need to do is take ideas and proposals and leverage the cognitive diversity of the commission to build the best possible solution through a virtuous spiral of improvement.  Sounds like buzzwordism, but it isn't.  By listening to everyone's ideas AND understanding those ideas, it's not only possible but relatively painless to build good solutions.  A good redistricting solution is one under which candidates for office cannot rely on some ""base"" to get them elected, but one under which every candidate must go and listen to and understand his/her potential constituents.  They need to appreciate that they are interviewing for a job, not selling some preconceived ideas to the unwashed masses.

I'll promote the creation of agreement among the commissioners by actively listening to each commissioner's ideas and concerns, by asking questions to ensure that I do understand and then by working to leverage the best of each proposal to achieve the best possible solution rather than the “least bad” solution we can all live with.  Part of that is to help every commissioner understand the power of cognitive diversity and how the team can harness and use that diversity effectively.  

I believe that the best solutions are those that are arrived at through fact-supported processes of discussing and overcoming challenges.  I recognize that I, like all humans, am subject to biases -- biases that, once recognized, can be overcome.  Since the best solutions are achieved through the active participation of a cognitively diverse group, it is absolutely mandatory that the inputs and ideas of all members of the group be seriously considered, incorporating them when those inputs and ideas will improve the outcome.  To my mind, the outcome, in this case, should ensure that competitive voting districts will make it necessary for candidates to engage the voters and propose solid, logical platforms.  That can only be accomplished in an impartial manner.  Pushing a pre-conceived agenda on the populous is the antithesis of achieving the best outcome.","I have engaged in no political activity since November 10, 2015",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/208,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/legislative/208.html

I also completed the welding program at Pickens Technical School in Aurora, CO a long time ago (I was certified but it has lapsed).  I also maintain a CDL with tanker endorsement.","Quite simply, I want two things:  
1. I want rural Colorado to have more of a voice in Colorado politics and decision making.  I believe a thoughtful redistricting will help this.
2. I will be perfectly honest and say that I want to influence the districting.  I have no interest in political office, but I have been concerned at the direction things have taken of late and want to have a hand in shaping the future direction the state goes in.","My experience thus far has been mainly in contacting elected officials, unelected officials, and the media concerning issues that are of importance to me.  My main focus thus far has been in advocating for privacy rights and transparency in using cell phone data to track citizens' movements, advocating for having the (once the initial emergency has been cleared) Colorado Assembly decide how to respond to pandemics rather than one man in the Governor's chair, and advocating for the rural parts of the state to have more of a voice in Colorado government.  I contact people via phone, via email, and have begun using social media as a way to contact officials and to reach directly through to people using my Facebook group Colorado Accountability Project.  I am also trying to encourage others to get involved by contacting their elected officials.","Outside of being a registered Libertarian since I first started voting, I am not a member of any political organizations.  I am not a member of any civic organizations or community organizations either.  Outside of commitments at my work (which wold be mostly internal committees like the Human Resources Leadership Committee) I am not a member of any other associations","I am not sure how to take the word “analytical” in your question; i.e. I am not sure if you mean analytical in terms of the ability to understand and parse an argument or position, or whether you mean analytical in the mathematical/statistical sense.  In either case I feel that I am well suited in this regard.  I did not take the road into academia, but most of my education has been along that line and I regularly work on learning new things in physics (which requires the ability to understand and break down mathematical/logical arguments and the ability to apply math to them).  I will be honest and tell you that my knowledge of some higher level statistics concepts is incomplete, but I learn quickly and don’t anticipate a problem.
As regards the second part of your question, I do not feel as though I will have an issue applying logic and reasoning to a problem.  When you go to solve a problem in physics or mathematics (especially once you are beyond the level of memorizing a formula and into the areas of novel study) that’s exactly what you do.  Interestingly, it’s also what you do when trying to fix something (I’m working on restoring a track loader and help my dad in his semi restorations) though perhaps with less or a different form of math.  I feel as though I am well practiced in this regard.","I am glad I’m coming upon this question a few years after I got married, because I believe being married has greatly shifted (for the better) my perspective on reaching consensus among two people who have strongly-held, opposite opinions.  If you’re also married, I’m sure you understand as well.  My experience thus far has taught me that promoting consensus or agreement starts by recognizing that people of good will can disagree, and that someone else not seeing things the way I do doesn't make them ignorant or careless or etc.   Starting from that point, I think consensus building or compromise takes the form of outlining why you feel the way you do, what your goals are, outlining what you can't live with, and then finding areas of agreement.  For the things that you cannot agree on, you return to what you can't live with, and start saying what you'll tolerate.  I think keeping in mind that the essence of good compromise means that you (and all other parties) will be a little unhappy helps too.  It keeps you focused on what a reasonable outcome will look like.
I would like to say that I’m perfect in regard to being impartial, but I cannot.  Being fair to others, however, is a big value of mine.  In my experience as a teacher, I have had numerous times where I’ve had a student that I didn’t like, or one that sent a nasty email to my boss, or some such.  I have then had the chance to catch that student in a “gotcha” situation—a situation where they’d broken some minor rule or forgotten a homework or some such.  I cannot tell you how good it would have felt to bring the hammer down, but if I allow everyone else one free mistake, I must allow the troublesome students the same grace--difficult as it is.  That’s plain fairness.  It’s how I would want to be treated.  As another example, you may have been able to read between the lines thus far and know that I disagree vehemently with many things that Gov Polis and others have done.  Perhaps not, but let me know make it explicitly clear.  I disagree vehemently with many of the policy decisions and actions that Polis and others have undertaken.  In my Facebook group posts (Colorado Accountability Project—you’re welcome to go see), I do my best in posting to not step outside the truth and to be fair.  For example, in a recent post (recent as I write this on 8/13), I wrote some notes on Polis taking grant money to fund some of his political priorities.  The very first thing I wrote is that it’s not illegal and he has not been the first governor to do so","This one will be brief.  My political activity is mostly recent.  I have, of course, voted in every election since I was eligible and try to do my due diligence on informing myself of the initiatives and etc. on the ballot, but it wasn't until recently (actually it was Gov Polis emergency declaration and state shutdown that spurred it) that I became more actively involved.  I have not ever, and do not plan to ever, donate money to any campaign, candidate, or political organization.  I have, however, spent a great deal of time emailing and talking to both elected and unelected people in the areas of interest to me in an effort to influence and change what I have seen happening lately in Colorado.  I have also (because the response rate from officials and the media can be dishearteningly small) begun to create groups and use social media to expand my reach and to go directly to people.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/79,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/legislative/79.html

I want to make a difference for Colorado voters.  As Booker T. Washington noted, “Those who are happiest are those who do the most for others” 

And, what can we do for others that is more important than ensure Colorado’s voters are fairly represented in our state’s Congressional and state districts?  The doctrine—one person, one vote—requires that electoral districts be apportioned fairly and accurately.  The 2021 redistricting of Colorado is extremely important.  Our state’s population has grown over the last 10 years.  Based on new census data, Colorado could gain an addition seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.  That would expand our state’s influence in national politics and increase federal funding for state projects.  Redistricting also impacts representation of Colorado’s growing diversity.","When I arrived in Washington, DC, there were two women working in the government affairs area.  One worked for the railroads and the other was with the International Ladies’ Garment Workers of America.  Those of us being hired for similar positions had few mentors.  We needed direction.  Twelve of us in the food industry founded Women in Government Relations.  Monthly luncheons featured effective speakers who gave us confidence and professional guidance.  For example, Elizabeth Dole spoke at a luncheon when she was serving on the Federal Trade Commission.  We shared books on effective management.  Our first salary survey resulted in 15 women getting raises after they presented the data to their bosses and demonstrated they were underpaid.  My work with the Front Range Community College Foundation includes writing pieces some of which emphasize the importance of scholarships in graduating skilled employees who meet Colorado businesses’ needs and how important they are to the state’s economy.  I gave an endowment to the college for needed equipment for students enrolled in our new Center for Integrated Manufacturing programs.","Current:  Front Range Community College Foundation – Board, Executive Committee, Chair of the Communications Committee; National Marine Mammal Foundation – Board, Secretary, Chair of the Communications and Investment Committees; Women in Government Relations – retired/emeritus/one of the 12 founders of the group
Past:  Ranch Reserve Homeowners Association, The Senior Hub, and Susan G. Komen Colorado","You cannot successfully run an organization without realistic budgeting.  You cannot successfully run a homeowners association without realistic budgeting and sufficient reserves for the future.  You cannot chair an Investment Committee without a Board-approved investment policy.  You cannot hire a new investment manager without a Request for Proposal.  You cannot look forward without thoughtful strategic planning.  No new challenge is unsurmountable.  You analyze.  You do research.  You learn.  You get it done.  While head of the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums, mediation was rarely needed.   But, a few situations demanded it.  A member was doing or saying something to the media that embarrassed another member.  Changing behavior and coming to an agreement takes patience, empathy, and persuasive skills.  
And, then there is communication.  A messaging strategy is the key to successfully marketing a business, a product, a political campaign, or a new concept, as well as effectively meeting both professional and personal goals and objectives.  The Front Range Community College Foundation depends on generous, caring donors to fund scholarships for needy students and capital improvements.  I draft many funding requests for Foundation staff to distribute.  The challenge is to understand your audience, analyze their motivations, and identify what has value and will motivate a potential donor to give.  This has been especially important during this pandemic, which caused students to lose their part-time jobs and their parents to lose their jobs and businesses.  The Foundation created a High Needs Fund for both students and adjunct instructors.  Many needed help, which required constant fundraising.  It was very rewarding when donors reacted positively and we could help so many students continue their educations.  One story we told often is that of a single mom who lost her job because of Covid.  She could no longer afford her apartment.  She moved in with her grandparents.  Because they are elderly, she could not search for another job, fearing if she brought the virus home they could die.  She needed help paying basic bills once she lost her income.  Booker T. Washington’s words ring very true when helping FRCC students reach for their dreams.","My Washington, DC, experiences and the various positions I held were centered on finding consensus among members of these organizations with different points of view and varying political perspectives.  I could not have succeeded without being fair and impartial.  I have never worked for any organization where I did not discuss issues with a team in the course of making a decision.  It varied from working with the Board to working with members of a committee.  Yes, I analyzed the issue, researched it, and crafted a recommendation.  But, it was only through consensus that a decision was reached.  Cognitive empathy is essential in coming to any agreement.  Active listening is effective.  It requires listening attentively and paraphrasing what has been said in any response, underscoring that you have heard and understand the point being made by another team member.  I socialize monthly with a neighbor who supports the opposite political party.  I bring up many, many subjects for discussion on which I know we can agree as caring women.  It underscores that we all have more we can agree on than disagree on in this sadly divisive time.","I was a volunteer in Dianne Primavera’s last campaigns for election and reelection to Colorado’s House of Representatives.

both in and out of the classroom. They are generally more candid and to the point than adults and seeing
things from their viewpoint is a valuable tool that I will bring to the commission.
I am a woman, of Asian descent, from a rural community, currently living in a suburban area. Growing
up, I understood the high cost of farming, and how things could turn with an untimely storm or drought,
as well as the magic of watching a crop grow, and the value of a hard day's work. My Asian heritage
provides background knowledge on the minority experience of racial and cultural discrimination. Being a
woman and adoptive mother provides additional lenses to view life. Finding one’s identity is especially
difficult for an adopted child who must sort through abandonment issues, and racial issues compounding
the already complex task of growing up. Women face every day challenges of balancing work and family,
often providing care for elderly parents and sick family members.
Fair maps will help ensure that each vote counts equally, and areas will not be skewed to the advantage of
any particular group or party. Fair maps will ensure our election officials accurately represent their
constituents.
Volunteering on several campaigns at the local, state and national levels has shown me the importance of
the election process in the preservation of our democracy. Working in public schools and engaging kids
in extracurricular activities gave me the opportunity to work with parents, professionals in the community,
and motivated students. These groups see things from slightly different viewpoints and it is a valuable
lesson in broadening my perspectives when interacting with a wide variety of groups.","As a member of Heritage Camps for Adoptive Families, we advocated for transracially adopted families
of all ethnic groups and genders. I helped organize family camps for several ethnicities as well as other
activities for families to educate, and provide social spaces for children to be with families who are in
similar situations.
In TUFIR we actively supported students and adults who were in the GEO ICE facility, and also
immigrants that were newly released from the facility. We provided food, clothing and money as support
as well as letters to ICE and our school district in support of immigrants. We also held training seminars
for adults and students on knowing your rights.
As the lead mentor for our FIRST Robotics team I advocated for kids of all ethnicities, genders and
abilities to have a true STEM experience. I started two teams, one in each school I was at, and
spearheaded fundraising for each team, and outreach to elementary and middle schools about robotics and
STEM.

our learning team, as teachers, we collected data, analyzed, reported out and modified by consensus our
teaching methods to improve student achievement. We always worked within a strict budget to purchase
chemicals and equipment. As a teacher, I taught students about the importance of producing data,
analyzing the data, checking for error and causes of error, and coming to conclusions based on data and
analysis.
As lead mentor for robotics I was in charge of creating and maintaining a budget to build the robot and
participate in competitions in and out of state. Engineering requires critical thinking and analytic skills to
design a robot that not only functions on paper, but also in real life competitions over several days.
During the build season we strategize, prototype, analyze and communicate to determine the best design.
We are constantly testing, analyzing and reworking designs. As is evident, I am very adept at not only utilizing analytical skills, but also teaching them.","When I had conferences with parents and students, I always allowed the parent and student to speak first,
so I could understand where they were coming from and gauge their level of frustration with the situation.
Using appropriate empathetic verbiage, I could attempt to get us both on the same page for goals, and
work backward to determine what actions would be needed to achieve those common goals.
Each year the robotics team has to tackle the challenge of designing and building a robot to play a new
game designed by engineers at FIRST. Our team consists of high school students, teachers, and engineer
mentors from the community. We established norms developed by our leadership team and mentors. At
the brainstorming session we announce and emphasize that everyone's opinion is important and worth
hearing. We divide into small groups, and after everyone has presented, make a list of pros and cons for
each idea. This helps make the process objective and is a framework for collaboration I would bring to

Accurate representation which is focused on solving our most pressing concerns as local communities, while advocating for those communities when solving the concerns of broader shared communities is how our representative democracy works most effectively. The only way to achieve that pillar of our us government is to make sure the resulting representatives most accurately represent the opinions of the voters. This needs to hold true whether their opinions are based on profession, age, ethics, ethnicity, faith, culture, interest or any other trait or belief. I want to help find a districting solution that makes sure the biggest stresses of the most Coloradans are the primary concerns of the our representatives while not suppressing the most critical issues of the minority groups. I want to help make sure every unique minority facet of our beautiful state can see themselves reflected in the advocacy of their representatives. More personally, I’m 29 years old with a unique skillset with a background in gis and data communication. I will be impacted by the echoing decisions of the committee for not just the next decade, but also by precedent for censuses to come. Likely though, age wise I will be under represented, particularly considering I am near the minimum age requirement of Colorado General Assembly. Despite my age though I have a wealth of experience and skills in geolocational and data based problem solving which is key in districting. I want to do this because I think I am a rare and valuable view point.","I have advocated for myself and the interests of people that share my profession, culture, ethics or region. As well as for those who I don’t immediately belong such as the bleeding disorder community, which I joined when I was a teenager because of a close relationship with someone with hemophilia. A recent example of success I have had organizing my community would be solving a storm water drainage issue in my neighborhood. I worked with my neighbors to define the problems causing water to pool in our yards, worked with civil engineers and contractors to develop a solution using chase drains. Then worked stakeholders like my neighbors, the town of Frederick public works, and our metro district to execute that solution while following requirements like permitting, the drainage plan and funding. The metro district then expanded that solution to other drainage issues in our subdivision.",National Hemophilia Society Colorado Chapter,"I have worked for the USGS (DOI), IBM and Maxar (formerly DigitalGlobe) working as a software developer on several missions in a variety of industries aerospace, meteorology, natural disasters, and shipping logistics. All of which involve logic and reasoned problem solving with complex GIS data. I daily: define problems, collect (physical, digital, legal, and financial) requirements, design solutions, communicate those solutions to clients, and implement those solutions. For example, when I worked for the United States Geologic Service a division in the Department of the Interior in college for 5 years; made earthquake risk maps. These maps are provided to first responders within 15 minutes of an earthquake to best make decisions about where victims meed help and what help they will need. I also made earthquake hazard maps for legislators and policy makers to use when designing building codes. I frequently worked with audiences like first responders and government officials to explain natural disaster risk and refine the information I provided to best serve the common goal of keeping people safe in the most extreme disasters.","I can reach a consensus for two reasons: Im an political independent use to finding common ground with both parties, and I am good at communicating complex data driven solutions particularly with maps. I believe the most stark differences in our political beliefs is not our political party, despite our representatives voting on party lines the majority of the time. When I talk with my diverse neighbors about how legislation would impact them in a way divorced from party and focused on their family, I find the divisions much more tied to their professions, faith, and interests. When I became an independent, it was to find candidates from both parties that shared my opinions and focus for political issues that impacted me. I think I can convince people from both parties of the real contrasts in our communities rather than focus on party and how best to make every diverse voice be represented. Additionally, I have worked on map and data presentation design to lay out non-partisan intents and draw a solution in a simple and understandable way.

There are many who don’t feel heard when they raise concerns.  Where I live, in Longmont, I know that the chances of electing a person to the Federal House of Representatives who reflects my community are almost nil.  
It is crucial that our political landscape become more about representing people and the local/ regional aspects of the communities where we live. My hope is that by serving on the committee, I can advocate for a fair map where everyone can know that their voice will be heard when voting.  A map that realizes the dream of equal representation, without favoring parties or special interests, while also acknowledges areas of our communities have special circumstances, such as
race and economic status that must be reflected in the maps. I continue to hope for a return to civility in politics where we listen to and learn from each other.","I am a long time environmental advocate.  Now that I am retired I have time to become personally engaged by working on issues important to me.  I bring my skills that include close to 40 years in management to this work. I am able to bring strategic decision making, collaboration, planning and financial ability to the organizations I work with.
Building support for sustainability throughout our community is vital to the work that Sustainable Resilient Longmont (SRL) undertakes. SRL engages residents across the community, including  youth and people of color in events such as earth day.  SRL Earth day is a focus on children and how they interact with the earth.  In 2020, the event moved on line with youth from local high schools discussing what climate change means in their lives. 
Another important aspect in community/ grassroots activism is working with city government.  I know all of the city council members personally.  I frequently speak at council meetings to advocate for environmental issues.  This relationship was a key element in achieving a Longmont Resolution to commit to 100% renewable energy by 2030.","Climate Reality, trained climate leader

Coloradans Resisting Extreme Energy Development","My success in Nursing Administration was based on my ability to analyze issues and apply data to arrive at a solution. I will relate a quality improvement project in my last position.  There were three ICU’s.  A QI project to reduce ventilator associated pneumonia was very successful in 2 of the 3.  The third, the Neuro Trauma ICU, was difficult, but knowing that there had to be a reason, a team explored the differences.  We discovered that patients who had head trauma were being transported daily for head CT scans.  The transport was putting them at risk and we were able to define some simple steps to prevent this complication.  
I apply the same type of skills to my activist work. When planning educational events about topics, such as renewable energy, exploring data and research studies informs how we plan events. Reading through online records of meetings and attending board meetings at Platte River Power Authority gives me the ability to discuss electricity generation with our city council and to speak with other community members.","As I look at the current political landscape, I see so much division. I grew up in rural Nebraska.  I know and love many folks who are conservative.  I am not afraid to reach out to those who do not share my political views.  In my work in Nursing Administration, being able to build relationships with people in other divisions was paramount to the success in my area of responsibility.  Also, working on projects that involved caregivers on several shifts, in several units on two campuses,  required skills in building consensus.  To bring in physician acceptance required negotiating skills.  I use these skills of negotiating, relationship and consensus building, plus willingness to work with people of diverse backgrounds to my activism work.  I also bring the nursing art and skill of empathy.  Stepping back to see the people behind decisions and how they are affected is needed in any work.
My work with SRL provides an example of how I can apply these skills. Acceptance of the possibility of renewable energy is difficult for many people.  Acknowledging that jobs in the fossil fuel industry will be lost, then discussing the potential of jobs in renewable energy requires listening first instead of arguing. This usually leads to a good conversation while planting seeds that may change minds.","Being involved in our democracy is important to me.  My involvement includes donations to candidates at all levels of our government, working with organizations to promote candidates, and personal engagement such as door to door campaigning. 
Locally I work with a grassroots group that delivers candidate information to residents in Longmont.  Through my local Sierra Club group in Boulder County, I work on candidate endorsements based on environmental priorities.  Also, I am on the board of Sustainable Resilient Longmont.  This organization holds candidate forums where candidates are asked questions about sustainability. 

This election season, I determined that I needed to engage in the Presidential Election.  I wrote letters, texted and made phone calls to battleground states through  Sierra Club Independent Action.

I want to serve on the commission because I believe that I can contribute thoughtfully to creating districts that are as fair for every voter as possible.","I have not done this type of work on any large scale.  However, I work very hard to seek out and understand many perspectives on societal issues that I encounter.  I was also on my HOA board in Denver back in 2014, so had to do my best to represent the needs of all owners in that capacity.","I attended Foothills Parks & Recreation's South Jeffco Business Alliance meetings regularly throughout 2019, as an Usborne Books & More consultant; and this year I made calls to voters as a volunteer for the Colorado Democratic Party.  I also attended a few School Advisory Committee meetings at my local elementary school, when my son was in preschool there last year.","I am someone who analyzes just about everything, and picks apart what I read.  I check sources, seek out faulty logic, and criticize lop-sided and poorly-researched arguments.  If I don't know about something that I want to discuss, I go and learn about it first.  Government matters should not ever be about personal preferences, but about how best to serve the constituents.  It should be based on data, reason, and empowering the people.","I believe that finding consensus among a group of commissioners that seeks fair representation for everyone in Colorado should be relatively straightforward.  In the event of facing a decision that involves trade-offs somehow, I would do my best to refer to the data and encourage others to do the same.  It is the data, the voters, and the extent to which each vote matters (which we should be maximizing), that should guide decision-making and help us to find consensus.
Fairness has always been incredibly important to me.  As the youngest child of three, I felt that much in my life was unfair, and from that I learned how to empathize and also how to work with others to find solutions that work for everyone -- so as to not leave them behind, as I had often felt left behind as a child.  While I realize that life itself is certainly not fair, we, as a commission with the intention of drawing fair districts for our state, should strive for fairness -- for making each vote count as best we can, regardless of who is casting it.","I definitely lean liberal and Democrat, though I was registered as Independent for several years.  I believe it is incredibly important to vote, and that civic engagement is crucial in a Democracy.  As I recall, I donated to Obama's campaign in 2012, and I definitely contributed to Amy McGrath's campaign in Kentucky this year, but I believe those are the only times I've contributed directly to a person's campaign.

Considering all of these pieces, I often also conduct my own research, through surveys, comparisons, or other methodology, to ensure I am on the right track. I firmly believe in a data-driven approach to applying best practices. That also means that if the data shows something to be ineffective, then I make adjustments, no matter how committed I was to the process originally. Additionally, I always try to look at the complete picture before forming decisions, not jumping to conclusions or making assumptions.","With my volunteer work, I facilitate difficult discussions to deepen people's abilities to resolve conflicts and find consensus. Through my volunteer and professional work, I regularly practice and teach active listening, the process of consensus, and effective communication. I will apply these skills in the commission and work to understand what my peers are saying and where they are coming from, and clearly state my views, and work to identify the compromises and agreements between them. I practice fairness and impartiality in my life regularly, including taking steps to fully understand others' points of view. For instance, when arguing with friends or partners, I often do a mental exercise with a third party where I take the argument of my ""opponent"" and let the third party argue my side. This allows me to more completely understand their perspective and adjust my POV or argument to better resolve the conflict. This, along with active listening and a deep care for others and all humanity, has provided me with the skills to manage and develop all sorts of relationships. Although, I am a registered democrat, both of my parents and much of my family are ardent republicans and we regularly have civilized discussions and come to agreements on topics that we initially disagreed upon.","I have no professional or formal experience organizing, advocating, or representing.

I sold the company in 2018 and have been a consultant since that time.",I graduated from the Ohio State University in June 1972 with dual bachelor’s degrees in aerospace engineering and in computer & information science.,"I believe that the process of creating districts for state legislature and national representatives has long been one that was hidden from public view. Whichever party was in the majority used its position to carve up the state to its own advantage. I believe the process should be open to and performed by the general public, and it's the reason I voted for the propositions to move the process to the citizens in 2018. It is also the primary reason for my interest in serving on the commission.

The 2020/21 redistricting for Colorado will be more difficult than the past several decennial redistricting efforts. Colorado has seen significant increases in its population since 2000 and the population has migrated within the state as well. Colorado’s increased population makes it highly likely that we will gain a U.S. House of Representatives seat and the allocation of seats in the state house and senate will also be significantly modified. For these reasons I think the redistricting commissions’ actions will be challenging. 

I believe that my analytical and organizational skills developed from my academic background in engineering as well as my real-life experience organizing and managing a company and a nonprofit give me the necessary qualifications to participate. I don't believe it's enough to merely shout about why something is a problem. When the opportunity presents itself, it is important to step up and offer your capabilities to improve the situation.","The founding and management of my company, Meeting the Challenge, certainly is my greatest example of all these areas. MTC competed for and was awarded a federal contract to operate the Americans with Disabilities Act Information Center for the six-state Rocky Mountain Region in 1991 and continues to operate the Center today. The company grew from a single person to over 20 employees and expanded its operations to organizations across the country. 

I would also point to my organization of the All Colorado Beer Festival as an example of my organizational skills. The ACBF's 1st festival in November 2013 attracted just under 1,000 patrons and 19 brewers and donated $10,000 to local nonprofits. In 2016 the festival had grown to over 2,600 attendees and 75 brewers. We donated $85,000 that year.

The ACBF raised and distributed over $500,000 during its 12 years of active operations. 

I was on the advisory board for the Home Front Cares from 2016 through 2019 and on its case review committee in 2018 and 2019. THFC gives grants to veterans and active duty military who have financial difficulties of many kinds. 

From 1974 through the present I have been a member of Theatreworks in Colorado Springs. I was a long-time board member, a technical director for several productions, and part time development director for the organization.","My training is as an engineer. I deal in analysis and logic. I have applied this training in nontraditional areas. Whether it was the founding and operation of a company devoted to disability rights, a beer festival to raise money for nonprofits, or our HOA, I have used my analysis and logic skills from engineering to present data for others to consider and from that data to build consensus for moving forward.","While I have strong views in politics - I am a registered Republican - my political outlook is more libertarian. I believe this outlook allows me to see the positions of both left and right more objectively. My goal if selected for the commission will be to move the process forward by listening to all comments and positions and to present my view objectively. Most people can come to consensus when provided with facts even when that consensus is not entirely their opinion. Several of my past experiences have helped me develop my consensus-building skills.

I was active in the Association of Computing Machinery starting in 1982. ACM is one of the largest professional computing societies in the world with over 80,000 members. I became the chair of the Special Interest Group (SIG) on computing and disability in 1987 and the chair of the SIG Council of over 50 individual SIGs in 1991. As the chair it was my responsibility to run semi-annual meetings of all the SIG chairs and ensure that all the disparate views and needs of the SIGs were fairly represented. In 1992 I was elected as vice president of the entire ACM organization. My experiences at ACM, while somewhat in the past helped me to understand how to get large groups of very disparate individuals to come to consensus.

From 1994-1999, I sat on two federal advisory committees to establish accessibility standards for electronic and information technology and facilities. I was a member of the U.S. Access Board’s Americans with Disabilities Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) Review Committee which was responsible for a complete assessment and rewrite of the ADAAG. The process took two years and required consensus-building to ensure that the new standards met the needs of the various disability groups while still being feasible for the construction industry. The Committee received the National Performance Review Award from Vice President Gore. I was also a member of the U.S. Access Board’s committee on Accessible Electronic and Information Technology and was on the ANSI A117.1 Working Group on dwelling unit accessibility.","I ran for and was elected as precinct chairman in the early 1980s and subsequently ran for and was elected as an elector to the district republican assembly and as an alternate to the state republican convention. 

In 1982 I attended a program oriented to teaching business-people and then encouraging them about running for public office. The program was organized by Steve Schuck. One of my co-students was Gale Norton who went on to hold positions in the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Interior and then Colorado Attorney General. I worked on Steve Schuck’s campaign for Colorado Governor in 1986.

I chaired the unsuccessful primary campaign for district attorney Ed Arcuri in 1984 when he ran against longtime incumbent, Robert Russel. The race was close enough that it triggered a recount which I was required to monitor. Barney Iuppa defeated Russel in the general election.

I provided data analysis for several of Mike Bird’s campaigns for state house and senate in the 1980s.

Our committee had to craft careful, fair evaluation reports that could be understood and accepted by advocates both for--and against--expanding charter schools, and also ones that would hold up to subsequent review and appeal.","I am mostly active in my local school district (serving on the BVSD DAC), and local school (University Hill Elementary). I also served on a state-wide commission to evaluate accountability measures for Alternative Education Campuses (AECs). Through my work and research at CU, I've organized a number of outreach events to help communities better understand--and deliberate about--standards, accountability and assessment. I'm committed to working across political lines to build opportunities for dialogue. I've worked both on the Front Range and also in NE Colorado to hold community forums and smaller school-based dialogues.","I am trained as a philosopher, and enjoy thinking through the various reasons, criteria or values at play in discussions. For instance, what principles or values might shape or guide redistricting choices? How might these principles be applied, fairly, and with an eye to their consequences, and the perhaps disparate consequences for differently situated groups? I also like careful and analytic writing, from meeting notes to final reports (sometimes an under-rated part of committee work!).","I am a Democrat, but grew up in a small town with many different political allegiances. I believe that I have a strong ability to hear--and empathize--with other viewpoints. As a faculty member, I have participated on many standing and ad-hoc committees, and often find ways to listen to different viewpoints, forge consensus, and move groups forward productively. I believe my colleagues would say that I am kind, a good listener, and someone who can always keep a sense of humor. While I am a registered Democrat, I strongly believe in fair play, equal representation and respectful debate/ conversation across political positions.","I am a registered Democrat, and have volunteered for the campaign of Dan Feehan (doing GOTV calls, mostly), who ran for the 1st District Congressional seat in Minnesota (the district where I grew up). I have donated (very modest amounts!) to mostly MN political campaigns: Dan Feehan (2018 and 2020), Amy Klobuchar (2020 Democratic primary) and Biden/Harris (2020 Presidential election). I have also given money to Wellstone Action (a MN organization).",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/2545,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/legislative/2545.html

Unbiased electoral maps in our state is the first step in creating a true and just process through fair and equal representation at the voting booth and thus through elected officials.

My studies included both traditional Mathematics, statistics, and computer science.  The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of formal systems and the deductive power of formal proof systems.  Understanding the philosophy of logic was key to achieving my Mathematics degree.  Mathematics and mathematical logic is an excellent preparation for law school and practicing law.  My legal career necessitated proficiency in analysis, logic and reason.  If a lawyer lacks any one of those skills, the lawyer loses his/her ability to reason and persuade, and will not succeed.
As but one example, I worked in the United Kingdom for several years during which the UK government decided to develop a regulatory framework for trading certain commodities for companies based there.  The issue became how to develop regulations that were at once transparent, provided accountability to government and yet fostered development of a robust and reputable industry would benefit the UK and EU.  My role was part of a 35-person business and government task force that over several months developed what became the regulations for regulating commodity trading in London and Brussels. If our task force had failed to equally address all aspects of our charge, we would've failed our assignment.  That process involved constant focus on solutions that would withstand inquiry, examination and criticism from every angle, recommendations that would be understandable, reasonable and logical.","I represented international, privately-held companies for over 35 years, in the US and outside the US.  This offered countless opportunities to work for solutions with diverse constituents around the world.  An advocate by training, I was taught (and lived by) the tenet that in order to represent one's client ably, one must be able to articulate the opposing side's position as well as one's own.  My professional success was attributed directly to my ability to help my clients see all sides, i.e., what my mentor described as the ability to let my clients have things my way.  I believe I have the ability to articulate without being pedantic, and most importantly, I have the ability to listen, learn and adjust my views, necessary skills to achieve consensus.
As an example, much of my business life involved clients who traded commodities and were among the very best in the world.  The trading business is supremely humbling.  Those who are convinced of their own correctness, who are unwilling to fairly judge the situation, risks and rewards, are doomed to quick failure.  I succeeded in that business for over twenty years until I was hired by Buckman Laboratories International to be their chief lawyer in 2002.  My success was directly attributable to my ability to be objectively assess facts and reject every possible decision bias.
From 2002 until I retiring in 2012, I was the Chief Legal and Compliance Officer for an international specialty chemicals company.  We did business in over ninety countries and our associates spoke over a dozen languages.  My job necessitated regular travel to Asia, Africa, South America and Europe, but it was common to hear several different languages spoken daily at our headquarters.  Because our organization pursued excellence in science, we developed and benefitted from a very diverse group of employees from around the world.  Daily I encountered diverse people and unique problems that required listening, interpretation, understanding and achieving consensus, and I excelled in our company's decision-making process.  My job as board secretary and general counsel required continually achieving consensus and agreement among a diverse and very talented board of directors for a company that was owned more than 50% by women, and I was pretty good at it.
In sum, I've been traveling and working around the world from a very early age.

Later, in a corporate development role at Madison Square Garden, or in operations with K1 Capital, I had no formal control over the people I needed to accomplish my professional goals.  I have always done this by understanding the perspectives and goals of each person around the table, and articulating why said initiative can help to further their goals, and focusing on other people's strengths in accomplishing these team goals.  I find that finding the common thread - the common purpose - brings people naturally onto the same page.

Starting in electronics, communications/rf, systems engineer & repair,  leading to networking, and computer repair. In all cases solutions to problems had to fit the conditions -- you can't fake data to solve a problem.  Research often solved problems (similar problems, or seemingly similar problems often lead to accurate answers).  Sometimes you found out that you didn't have enough information; I couldn't be afraid to ask for additional resources when potential solutions didn't work, or results didn't meet expectations.  In other words, sometimes you have to start over, as the apparent scope of the problem didn't fit the results.  It happened occasionally -- let your customer know that a problem remained unresolved and add additional resources to the data gathering (where often information about prior work changed the resulting efforts).   As well as add additional 3rd party technical expertise (more finite analysis of the symptoms).    With my business it isn't much different.  If a customer wants some work done I am not particularly familiar with, I research the request:  process, materials, tooling, time required, ability to master the techniques in a timely matter; will it be financially worth it to do the work (do I expect to do it again, not make as much margin; will the first customer be willing to pay enough to do the work, etc).  If it's a small enough part of a job, do I take a loss for the work in the rest of the project?  Do I know someone better suited for the work?  Do I want to do the work?","Most of my life I have been in repair in one field or another, the past few years in a new career field running my own business.

Considering a large list of inputs, then whittling them down by the conditions to the best or most likely results.  Everyone wants to contribute -- it's voluntary to even be on the committee. And everyone has something of value to contribute. Some will contribute ideas, some will contribute by asking hard questions or requiring accurate data.  Others simply by putting together data.  Even those that aren't in agreement force the rest to confirm their reasons for a decision.  Being fair is usually as simple as being polite -- let the other person have a say, wait for your turn, etc.  Being impartial shouldn't be an issue for anyone on the committee -- leave it at the door; this is a job as much as it is a civic responsibility.",Nothing in particular.

Legislative districts should fairly represent communities of interest and be balanced sufficiently to allow the votes of all community members to be influential in the election outcome.  Based on my experience representing a legislative district where the voting performance favored the other party, I believe that competitive districts make for responsive representation and accountability to the most people.  I also recognize that given the concentration of partisan affiliations in certain areas, drawing competitive districts is difficult, and in those cases, retaining communities of interest should be paramount. 
I also want to serve because I would like to use my decades of experience and knowledge to continue giving back to Colorado through the important process of legislative redistricting. It would be an honor to serve on the Commission.","I devoted my life for the last 35 years to making Colorado a better place to live through advocacy and  considering interest groups.  I have come to know all regions of the state extensively and to appreciate the different regional economies and cultures. 
As the lone Democrat in the House from El Paso County, I advocated for change in air quality, mined land reclamation, school finance and tax policy (before TABOR) in ways that differentiated me.   At the same time, I listened to and represented other views (e.g. home schooling, support for death penalty).  I worked with state and local agencies to solve every-day constituent problems with government. I was re-elected twice and did not run in 1992.  
Gov. Romer and Ken Salazar (both as AG and Senator) actively traveled to and involved all regions of the state. Both believed that governing was the art of the possible, while making decisions based on principle and rarely for politics.  One good example was fashioning the refund mechanism for the first TABOR surplus in 1997. As the Revenue Director, I played a key role in presenting options.  The Governor favored a per capita refund and the Republicans (who controlled both houses) favored an income tax reduction (which benefitted upper incomes.) During a special session, all eventually agreed on the sales tax refund based on tiered income levels, which required a compromise by all and a lot of negotiation, in which I played a role for the Governor.
Sen. Salazar had a specific set of goals to achieve for each region of the state which involved federal policy (e.g. water, agriculture, job creation, public land use.)  In my role as State Director, I worked with the Senator and our state staff to listen to local citizens and elected officials, turn these needs into a plan and track progress. 
Colorado Nonprofit Association is a statewide organization with 1,500 nonprofit members.  We advocate for public policies and public awareness that support a strong nonprofit community, such as charitable giving. My knowledge of and relationships across the state have helped for the Association to advocate for the essential community work of nonprofits.  The Association has spearheaded several legislative policy initiatives to grow charitable giving, most recently Donate to a Colorado Nonprofit that enables a taxpayer to donate their state income tax refund to an eligible nonprofit of their choice.  In 2018, we also merged with a similar organization in Colorado Springs which required balancing the interests of two organizations and their members and merging two organizational cultures to better serve the Pikes Peak Region and nonprofits statewide.
In sum, I believe that representing, advocating for and considering the interests of groups in Colorado is what I have done and do every day.","Mile High United Way, Board of Trustees, 2010-present

Applying rules to a set of facts, through analytical skills, logic and reason is what lawyers do.  As director of the Revenue Department, we faced several dynamic problems requiring solution, including a new vehicle emission testing system, modernizing legacy computer systems, revising tribal Indian gaming compacts to name a few.  As CEO of the Colorado Nonprofit Association, I negotiated agreements to form a collaborative shared space, sell a wholly-owned insurance agency and merge with another nonprofit, each of which involved problem solving within a framework of logic and law.","Consensus begins with agreement on a shared set of values and guiding principles. In this case, the laws setting forth redistricting criteria provide most of the guiding principles.  These principles establish the framework for fairness and impartiality.  As a group, we should always refer back to the law when considering options.  The commissioners should also establish a set of ground rules that allow for all views to be heard and respected.  When disagreements arise, we should work for compromise as a group and be willing to compromise individually in accordance with the law and guiding principles.  My experience as a legislator, attorney, board chair and CEO negotiating agreements has all involved establishing guiding principles and then listening, negotiating, and suggesting language acceptable to all.","I served in the Colorado House of Representatives from 1987-1992, representing a district in El Paso County as a Democrat.  My public service also includes Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Revenue for Governor Roy Romer (1992-1999), Deputy Attorney General for State Services for Ken Salazar and John Suthers (1999-2006) and State Director for U.S. Ken Salazar from December 2006 to January 2009.  Of these roles, State Representative and working for Sen. Salazar were inherently political. In the other positions, I worked for a Democratic official (except two years with John Suthers) who won re-election during my service.  During all of this period, I was actively involved in the state and local Democratic party.  While partisan, the politics of that era were practical and required compromise and working across the aisle.  After becoming CEO of the Colorado Nonprofit Association in March 2009, I was not involved in the party except to make a nominating speech at the Jefferson County Democratic Assembly for Dave Ruchman, a long-time friend, when he ran for state Senate (2010.)  My campaign contributions until the 2018 election cycle were mostly to friends with whom I shared public service.  In 2018 and 2020 election, I made contributions to candidates to support change in our country.

I also have experience with the Gerrychain software developed by the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering group of Tufts University and MIT. I can use it both to measure the qualities of a given map (compactness, competitiveness, proportionality) and to perform an ensemble analysis. This technique involves teaching a computer to draw several billion legal maps that then serve as a representative sample that you can compare any given map against. My core concern is that the map drawn by the commission fairly represents the population of Colorado and has neutral to no impact on the outcome of future elections.","As a teacher it's my job to communicate complicated ideas in an accessible way.

Especially with our ""first past the post"" system, dominated by two political parties, allowing voters the ability to pick their representatives (and not the other way around) is critical. I strongly believe that a large contributing factor to our current political extremes is due to parties controlling redistricting, almost guaranteeing their victory, which leads to politicians having to go further and further to extremes. If districts were created with voters in mind, it would likely help to act as a moderating effect on candidates.

As the “bond counsel” (the lead lawyer) for hundreds of complex public finance transactions involving billions and billions of dollars, it has been my job: to identify the legal, financial and operational issues involved in the transactions; to facilitate negotiations among the parties until everyone agrees on all the rights and obligations of each party; to draft the legal documents governing the transactions; to revise and rerevise the legal documents until everyone’s issues have been resolved and written down; and, finally, to deliver legal opinions that the financing transaction described in the legal documents complies with a complex array of federal, state and local laws.

legislative,845,2020-10-15T22:53:20Z,David Gray,,Democrat,Male,m,Caucasian,False,81224,Retired,"Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Political Science, Michigan State University
 Masters of Public Policy, University of Michigan","I have a life long interest in government, public policy and politics.  As you can see from my resume I studied Political Science as an under graduated and received my masters degree in Public Policy.  In my first career I pursued these interests by working for a member of the US House of Representatives (William Ford, MI) and then by working on political campaigns for US House, State Senate and Governor.   
I was fortunate to work for a US House member during redistricting after the 1990 Census and witnessed first hand some of the inner workings of this process as well as seeing how critical district boundaries were in shaping the composition of future governments and ultimately influencing future public policy.    As a graduate student in Public Policy I was able to take a seminar on apportionment and redistricting and learn of some of the academic work around these subjects and some early proposals by academics to limit some of the partisan influences from the process (my favorite from the time was proposal that representatives from each political party would take turns drawing a single district boundary line on a redistricting map – the theory being that by forcing them to alternate turns each side would reduce the ability of either side to maximize the boundaries to their advantage).
I, like many of our fellow citizens (as demonstrated by the passage of the redistricting commission ballot initiative) have become concerned over the increasing bitterness in partisan politics over the last decade.  While I have strong opinions and beliefs over what is “good” policy and advocate for those positions (and the candidates who support them), I also recognize that others hold just as strongly held beliefs that differ sharply from my own.  As we have grown more polarized I have worried that our governing institutions have struggled to perform in ways that serve our common good.  I have come to agree with the position that a significant contributing factor to this polarization has been the process used to draw district boundaries for state and federal elections.  With the massive increase in availability of detailed data about the electorate (by every conceivable dimensions – age, gender, party affiliation, race, ethnicity, income, education, ……) combined the geospacial computing technology available to use this data, we really had reached the point where the party in power during redistricting can maximize their partisan advantages in unprecedented ways. While Colorado’s previous process what not nearly as bad as other states, it still led to may inequities in district boundaries that contributed to this problem.  
The creation of politically motivated boundaries lines resulted in far too many uncompetitive districts where one political party was almost assured of election. The only competitive elections in these districts where in primary elections, which often resulted in the election of candidates that take the most extreme partisan positions.
It is my strong hope that through the new redistricting commission Colorado will draw election boundaries that will result in as many competitive seats as possible, thus improving the opportunity for candidates who will have motivation to seek out solutions that represent that views of  citizens from across the political spectrum.",See answer below regarding promoting consensus,N/A  In my career as a healthcare consultant I traveled around the country on a regular basis which did not allow time for this type of volunteer activity,"In my career as a health care consultant I specialized in the use of data and analytics to drive strategy development and implementation.  I was privileged to work for some of the pioneering healthcare information companies (HCIA, Sachs Group, MedStat – which were eventually purchased by IBM Watson Healthcare) and develop a strong set of technical and analytical skills to use information to drive decision making.  At IBM I led a group of PhD data scientist, health care analysts and consultants to develop data driven solutions to some of the most challenging problems in the business of healthcare.  In this role we used the same type of data (demographical, education, income, location….) and geospacial technology that are used for redistricting.   I was responsible for leading and challenging this team to turn “data” and “analytics” into actionable information and insights to drive decision making processes.  Through this work I believe I have a strong foundation in the technology, analytics and logic required to develop districts that meet the criteria for determining congressional districts.","Prior to my retirement this past year I worked as a Strategy and Business Development consultant in the Health Care sector.  I this role I would often be hired by large health care systems to work across their organizations - with Board Members, Executives, Physicians, Front Line staff, Community members…. To develop a strategic vision and implementation plan for how an organization was to achieve their strategic goals.   In this role I would have to facilitate a process to bring diverse constituencies to a consensus on a common set of goals.  At the same time I was also responsible for providing my own inputs into this process – advising senior leaders on strategic options based on my industry observations and expertise.  I believe my years of professional experience in strategy and facilitation combined with my passionate believe in the objectives of the redistricting commission will allow me to contribute to a commission that would be able to arrive at a consensus for the good of the citizens of Colorado and not for any individual position or faction.","Early in my career I worked for a member of the U.S. Congress (William Ford, D - Michigan) as well as worked on campaigns for candidates for  for U.S. Congressional, State of Michigan Senate and State of Michigan Governor;

It is a critical element of our democracy and I find it sadly frustrating that so many people choose not to participate, and yet, still want their voices heard. After decades of discussions and study, I know that people fail to participate because they feel that their representatives don't listen or have their own agendas. I believe much of this attitude is the result of gerrymandering and it has caused great dissatisfaction among the voting population. All people want is for their vote to weigh equally with any other vote. Gerrymandering has inhibited fair elections in the US almost since our inception and it is simply time to put an end to the practice. It will encourage more people to participate and will result in more fairness in election results. Additionally, people are sick of the same representatives and senators representing them term after term. The system, as it stands now, is designed to encourage incumbents win re-election, which limits new ideas and voices in our system.","Advocacy has been an integral part of teaching the Social Sciences and Special Education for me.

This requires open and honest communication and keeping an open mind to others' ideas.","My political activity has been limited due to my teaching position in D20.

Bachelor of Social Work degree University of Nebraska at Lincoln","While employed in leadership positions it did not seem feasible for me to take on responsibilities such as this one. My whole adult life I have wanted to be more involved in public service at a governmental level. I was asked to run for office on a couple of occasions and decided against it. Since retirement, I have evolved to a place where I am ready to dedicate myself to something special and different. I am a bit of a “policy wonk” and when I voted on the ballot initiatives that created these commissions, I was already thinking about how I could get involved once the process began. I heard about All on the Line and attended one of their trainings in Fort Collins. I was impressed by Olivia Mendoza and became really excited about applying for the commissions. I believe I have the temperament, experience, and skills to play a valuable role as a commission member. I am also dedicated to seeing our State be successful as we take on this cutting edge and forward thinking process that can become a model to the rest of the country for creating fair and just representation within government.","During my 25 years with Project Self-Sufficiency (1989-2014) my focus was on assisting low-income single parents as they moved from poverty to financial independence. I continue to have relationships with many of the parents who either graduated from the program or participated in services during my years there. I often serve as a mentor and write letters of recommendation. As Executive Director I represented our organization at the Women's Foundation of Colorado in Denver, attending advocacy meetings and helping with research projects. I also coordinated services with other community based organizations here in Larimer County. During the years of Welfare Reform I was very active at the State and Local levels in advocating for families living in poverty. While Executive Director, I also served as Program Manager as we did not add that position until later. I expended a good deal of creative energy and networked extensively to establish programs for single parents like the Cars for Families program and special child care and scholarship funds. I sought out partners like the fleet services staff at Larimer County, the City of Fort Collins, and Aims Community College to arrange for volunteer car repair. I worked closely with local housing authorities to secure rent subsidies for families in the PS-S program. I developed quite a local and even statewide reputation and received a number of awards mentioned in my resume.","I have consistently been a volunteer for Project Self-Sufficiency of Loveland-Fort Collins since retiring from that organization in November 2014. I was Executive Director for 25 years. Since leaving employment there, I have continued on the Scholarship Committee and meet periodically with my successor as well as helping out with newsletter articles and special events. After leaving Project Self-Sufficiency, I worked for the Colorado State University School of Social Work for three years placing undergraduate and graduate level students into internships with organizations around the State. Since retiring from CSU, I have continued to serve as a volunteer Field Instructor for various Larimer County organizations accepting students. As recently as May 2020, I was the Field Instructor for two social work students at Alternatives to Violence in Loveland. I have been serving on the Board of Directors for the Sam S. Bloom Foundation (based out of Centennial, Colorado) for over six years and chair two committees. We distribute grants to nonprofit organizations around the State of Colorado. In recent months, I served on a Larimer County advisory committee distributing federal COVID funds to local organizations. We made recommendations after reviewing funding requests.  I have also volunteered with the City of Loveland, helping with resource distribution for people experiencing homelessness. The attached resume provides some additional information on my experience and service over the years.","I tend to be a cautious thinker, looking closely at the details in any situation, considering worst and best case scenarios, anticipating unintended consequences, and looking at the long term effects of decisions made now. I continue to marvel at the forethought New Yorkers exhibited when they created Central Park so many years ago. I like to do research and look at best practices to discover ideas and examples of what can work and under what circumstances. My mother was an amazing problem solver and could rig up the most fascinating solutions to a practical problem. I have tried to learn from her example. I look at common sense solutions as well as the spirit of the law.","My social work education and many years of experience have helped me build a skill set that would assist with this process. As a nonprofit leader, it has often been my goal and my role to build consensus by finding common interests and concerns among participating individuals and organizations. Digging deep to identify my own personal experiences that relate to the topic at hand, as well as helping others do the same, creates an opportunity to build consensus. Story telling and other real life examples of how people are affected is often an effective tool. It is important to see beyond the obvious and look for unintended consequences. I would listen to all points of view and differing opinions, especially coming from local communities and special populations that would be impacted. It is critical to consider diversity within populations, issues that bind communities together, and special circumstances experienced by varying communities. I am rather obsessive about fairness and go to great lengths to make sure a process is fair. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt while gathering more information. We each need to look at our own potential biases and rise above those. In my leadership role at Project Self-Sufficiency, I was known for my inclusive and demographic style of decision making. I worked closely with staff and board members, while also seeking input from program participants. While serving as an Election Judge for Larimer County in 2018, I worked side by side with Republicans and Unaffiliated coworkers to successfully review the status of individual voters at a polling place.","I am currently assisting with phone calling for the Harris-Biden Campaign and assisted Gordon McLaughlin for DA Eighth Judicial District with yard sign delivery.

In my view, both Democratic and Republican parties have become too self-serving in a way that seeks to concentrate and solidify political power instead of representing their citizens' membership with an intent to govern responsibly. One of the approaches that the parties have taken is to seek to gerrymander various systems to favor their party interests at the expense of individual citizens.

Under my guidance, the USFS continues to partner with various State (CDPHE, CDRMS, CGS & others), federal (US EPA, US DOE, US DoJ, DOI (including BLM and NPS) to address remediation of abandoned hardrock mines throughout Colorado. At home, both as a BM HOA board member and citizen of the Bear Mountain neighborhood, I shared my 20+ years of experience as a volunteer firefighter, red-carded wildland firefighter and emergency response manager at both federal and local levels to advocate for FIREWISE implementation in our neighborhood.

I believe that our Colorado representatives should represent constituents of similar local concerns and not be far removed from many constituents located in the far reaches of a gerrymandered district.

I think we can do better. I think we can make fairer districts.  Colorado is a purple state that has had a tilt to either blue or red depending on the election in the last 25 years.  In most years, we should expect Colorado's 65 state house districts to have a 55%/45% split of major parties serving in the state House. In years, with significant sea changes or ""waves"" of one party preference, the split should be no more than 65%/35% split.

All too often members of both parties seem more concerned with solidifying their own interests and political purposes than looking out for constituents and the greater good -- this is something George Washington specifically warned us about and we're seeing come into fruition. 

Especially in a state like Colorado, where so many voters are unaffiliated, the power of parties to draw districts should be minimized or eliminated. I'm grateful that Colorado has independent commissions to do so, and I know the importance of well-drawn non-partisan districts. I'm honored to be considered for the opportunity to ensure the next 10 years are designed to serve the citizens of Colorado, not political parties.","My entire job is advocating for under-represented voices in our community -- I'm the CEO of Minds Matter Colorado, which connects driven and determined high school students from low-income families with the people, preparation, and possibilities they need to succeed in college, create their futures, and change the world.

I do this all rationally and logically, and lay out steps in a clear process, but with an emotional connection to the end goal, and bringing along teams of volunteers to achieve that goal.","People who know me will vouch for my willingness to engage with everyone, put judgment to the side, and have meaningful conversations with people who disagree with me.

I speak French and Portuguese, in addition to being bilingual in English and Spanish.","I want to serve on the commission because I know that the geography of political districts has a large effect on representation. The legislative change that put decennial redistricting in the hands of independent commissions in Colorado is a move in the right direction, as partisan gerrymandering has made congressional races less competitive. In addition to creating safe seats, gerrymandering reduces the incentives of elected representatives to be responsive to the median voter, as gerrymandering allows districts to be ""packed"" with like-minded voters, and is an obstacle to pluralism through the practice of ""cracking"", or diluting the vote likely to elect the opposing party. These factors combined contribute to higher barriers to entry to political office and lower bi-partisanship.","Through my volunteer work with the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network (RMIAN) I seek to ensure that all people have knowledge of their legal rights and receive due process. My work with RMIAN, however, goes beyond my interpretation assignments and extends to helping immigrants become successful members of our community.",I am a pro-bono interpreter with the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network since 2017. From 2017-2019 I worked alongside Humanitas360 conducting research on prison work cooperatives in Latin America.,"Perhaps the most intense period of training in analytical and logical skills happened for me during graduate school. There I learned to ask questions that lend themselves to empirical testing and to chose and apply the methodology most appropriate to evaluating potential answers. We delved into topics such as whether we can establish a robust relationship between cause and effect and eliminate alternative explanations for a finding, and whether the same findings can be replicated in other settings. I later taught research methodology for the social sciences at the Colorado School of Mines. With my students I explored issues of omitted variables, selection bias, and missing data. My training as a researcher and my experience teaching others how to ask questions and test answers are well suited to the tasks of the redistricting commission: absorbing large amounts of information, analyzing data, and weighing competing interests. I am experienced in the use of statistical software and familiar with geospatial programs as well (e.g. ArcGIS).","My ability to be fair and promote consensus comes from my years teaching college students and working in the courts. One of the goals of teaching about politics and government is to give students the knowledge and skills to form opinions and defend them. It is the instructor’s responsibility to facilitate class discussion and model appropriate behavior. One technique I have used to facilitate the free exchange of ideas is to collectively agree on a short set of beliefs for opposing points of view on a policy issue, and then assign students to defend a belief, regardless of his/her own stand on the issue. This exercise illustrates that competing points of view can be grounded in acceptable ideas and be the result of sound reasoning. From there, the exercise moved on to the construction of a counter-argument, where students would choose what position to take on an issue. A similar process can be used in other contexts to facilitate consensus. Working in courtrooms I have learned that impartiality is as much a state of mind, as the result of adhering to procedure. Jurors, for example, can be instructed to follow a set of rules in the evaluation of evidence. This, in turn, can lead to a shared understanding of the evidence and to a consensus-based decision that is informed but not pre-determined by prior held beliefs. The process of first reaching an agreement on the steps to be followed in the evaluation of information can be used in other contexts as a way of facilitating joint decision-making. Perhaps the hardest goal to achieve in the process of redistricting is fairness. The American system of representation rests on the idea of equality of representation of all people, yet we know that the same vote will either fall in the winning majority or in the losing minority, depending on the location of the district line. If selected to serve on the commission, I will bring all my energy, knowledge, and experience to achieve this ultimate goal.",I volunteered for the campaign to elect Phil Weiser as Colorado's Attorney General and for Mike Johnston's primary campaign for the Colorado governorship.

I keep focused on our purpose, our commitment to our community, and how we can contribute to a process that allows all to be heard, where those with the least resources and access are sought out, that is respectful, and comes to a conclusion that works for all of Colorado.

Finally, I am a mom of three young children living in a multi-generational household in the suburbs. I was born and raised in a rural farming community that strongly formed my values, I have lived in and currently work in our state’s largest urban center. I have travelled to nearly every county and town in Colorado. The outcomes from the redistricting commission are crucial in how we value all Coloradans. I am an experienced representative of my congressional district on a commission and a committed community member. I want to model for my children that a good process requires people of all backgrounds to come forward to serve and work together for our future.  It would be an honor and a pleasure to serve Colorado in this way.","I have lived in Colorado for 20 years. I started by living in an intentional community where all residents of the program served as full-time volunteers in Denver. My experience supporting participants in programs for food assistance and basic services informed my interest in public policy and informed decisions that serve, respect, and represent all residents of our community.

In my work and leadership through Housing Justice and the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, I traveled to most cities, towns and counties in our state. I organized in faith communities to inform and equip people of faith as advocates for affordable housing and for our neighbors who need housing stability. I worked with school districts, county and city leaders across the state to inform and educate on fair housing laws, organized in rural and frontier communities to support women’s health, and communicated with as many communities and residents as possible to understand, inform and shape public policies that moved us toward better health and increased housing stability in our state.

Specifically, I have served as Chair of the Colorado Housing Investment Fund Coalition where I supported the growth of the organization from a couple dozen to more than 200 organizational supporters and hundreds of individual supporters. My role was to help facilitate constructive conversations that shaped our proposal to fund affordable housing throughout Colorado in a way that served all contexts and communities in Colorado. There were a variety of opinions, needs, economic factors, and people to serve. Many of my skills in bringing people together around common purpose, finding compromises, and articulating policies that are flexible to support needs in the variety of communities throughout Colorado were honed in this experience. I participated in community forums in gyms, county courthouses, community rec centers, schools, faith communities, nonprofits, and businesses in congressional districts across the state. This is how I discovered many of my favorite cafes, mountain passes, and county roads in Colorado. This is also how I got to know more intimately the flavors of government and economic conditions that vary from our plains, to our rural resort towns, to our ranching and mining and extraction areas, to our suburbs and urban centers.

I was in the 2009-2010 class of Leadership Jefferson County. We looked in depth at policy areas and government functions in the county. After graduating, I continued as a volunteer with the State Day Committee, where we plan and support the current class on the day they dive into State Government. These experiences have led to lasting relationships across the county and with the West Metro Chamber. 

My most similar commission experience was in serving on the State Housing Board representing Colorado’s 7th Congressional District. I served as a member, then Vice Chair, and finally Chair in my eight years and two terms on the board. We carefully considered many complex investments, regulations and rules, and complicated matters. We worked together as a diverse body with balanced political affiliation and made considered decisions and recommendations. On almost all matters we worked to consensus and hammered out to agreement. I can only remember less than a handful of votes that were split decisions. I presided over meetings and public hearings. Our environment was always respectful and collegial even when matters were complicated and passionate views were expressed.

My most recent experience was on the Advisory Committee revising the Code of Conduct for the Regional Transportation District. This committee met for several months this spring and summer and was conducted virtually. There were complexities, legalities, and a variety of opinions. I asked questions that grew insight for the body and utilized my representation as a mom living in the suburbs and traveling the system for commutes and recreation to give insights. We waded through considerations for customers and employees, as well as organizations, persons experiencing homelessness, and the community at large, and considered equity as we worked through the material. We came to compromises and worked out a unanimous recommendation that was ultimately approved by the board.","Colorado State Housing Board, appointed to represent the 7th Congressional District, Chair, Vice Chair and Member 2012-2020

I find it useful to write the argument or logic flow down to better understand perspectives that differ from my own. It helps me dispassionately evaluate where I could learn or improve the logic of the argument, including my own.

I have found being approachable, building individual relationships, and being steady and consistent have been important to building trust and creating agreement in any body. I will ask respectful questions and articulate why I support a particular approach. That said, I am persuadable and open to being shaped by the experience of my colleagues as well as the presented information. I will articulate why I found something persuasive and this transparency has contributed to consensus building in the past.

Democracy asks that the people participate in their civic society and I celebrate the freedom that is contained in civic participation. We citizens get to come together and listen to ideas other than our own, understand that the people speaking are just as passionate as I am, that they too are participants in a democracy and by listening to them, I learn about how they come to their own conclusions. I like to do the work necessary to not only collaborate and compromise but within that energy-filled exchange of ideas, philosophies and principles, I thrive and ferret out common places where we can work to resolve our differences without attacking each other personally. I find it sad the way public discourse has dissolved into ad hominem attacks, petty jabs and purity standards that few if any can achieve. We all lose when we do not listen and talk with each other - not at each other and I would prefer to help create a win-win scenario for all involved, and while some may think that is naive, I believe in it firmly until all other options are completely exhausted.","I was actively involved in organizing for JCEA for many, many years as I really enjoy helping people understand the collective power they have as members of a democratic society.

Was also a board member of Facing History and Ourselves. Currently, I am a member of JCEA Retired.","SKILL #1: GATHER DATA 
I really believe it is very important to collect all necessary information (documents, facts, data, numbers - any information that pertains to the topic) to provide the opportunity to make a well-informed decision. As a bargainer, I had to have a wide-variety of information before me - budgetary numbers from the state and the District, survey data from teachers I represented, bargaining information about what other Districts were asking for, etc. and use all of this information to help frame a sound bargaining position and help create an ratifiable agreement. 
SKILL #2:  LISTEN 
As a member of the bargaining team, I felt it was my responsibility to listen to all members - from both ends of the spectrum. As the bargaining chair, I recall visiting a high school and listened for two hours as a few members aggressively told me what needed to be done and how I needed to bargain. I listened to them get all of their frustrations out (and I did not personalize anything). I have learned that there are many, many reasons why people will lash out at someone. Often it is out of frustration and I was simply the person nearby. When people feel they are not being honored, or appreciated, they oftentimes lash out at someone they are comfortable with. It is safe, and so I ""put up my shields"" and work to actively listen and ask more questions when I did not understand. I began to address many of their concerns and was interrupted by a teacher and as he began to challenge me, his peers asked him to quiet down. ""She listened to us for two hours so let her answer.""  As I walked out of that meeting, one of the most vocal critics walked me to my car and thanked me for coming ""to the proverbial Lion's Den."" I asked him to join our team, and he declined but got another member of his faculty to join. It was a good day!
SKILL 3: HARD ON ISSUES AND SOFT ON PEOPLE- Tough decisions must be made when I agreed to be a bargainer, to be on a hiring committee, whenever I stepped into a leadership role.  I worked with limited resources and budgets, with ideological purists in labor issues, with apathetic members who just wanted an agreement reached - but none of those issues were one person's fault. Complex problems oftentimes create complex solutions and I believe in communicating often to keep people informed, as best we can, which leads to skill #4.
SKILL #4: COMMUNICATION - Keep people as informed as you can, know your audience and respect your teams and the tasks you have been assigned.
SKILL #5: RECOGNIZE WE ARE HUMAN -Emotions and reason do not mix well and yet they both emerge when difficult topics are being worked  on. Processing information when solving problems is critically important, and I believe a process must be honored. As a member of the bargaining team, I recall hearing ""I hate this process it is tedious and takes time and why can we not just get to solving the problem."" Members from both sides of the table, would make comments like this. And whether it was because I had bargained for so many years and understood the process, and of recognizing the role time plays in creating a ratifiable document, or because I was the oldest, I counseled members about the importance of time. Good wine and cheese need time and the historian in my reminded people that the Founding Fathers worked on the Constitution for four years and still they did not have the Bill of RIghts in the document. That came a few years later after members of this new society saw what needed to be tinkered with and what truly needed to be enshrined in a document such as the US Constitution. Now, that all being said - time is not something to be used to delay, or prevent a solution from being achieved - so I manage the process as best I can ( to both honor the time needed to craft a good agreement, to allow people the time they may need to think out loud, to get frustrated, and then when we need to push through - do and get the work done. It is a balancing act that I believe in the end more accurately ensures a better agreement.
SKILL #6: Celebrate in the end the good work of the people involved and thank them for their work, time and commitment.","I operate with a single principle: difference is not synonymous with deficient. Other's opinions and values reflect a human being before me who is just as passionate as I am, and I want to know and understand (deeply) how they arrived at those conclusions. I also believe that I do not need to make others wrong in order to make me right. I have a personal anecdote I wish to share to demonstrate this philosophy. A former student Austin Ness sent me this letter in May of this year as I was retiring. Austin graduated four years ago and I asked him if it was alright to share this with you. ""Of the near endless memories I have of my time in the collective annex of WRHS with you, one that consistently springs to my mind comes from your AP Psychology course my senior year. I can’t remember why the topic came up in such a course, but during one of our discussions another student, XXXXX XXXXX, commented on what he took to be the over-reach of the “femi-nazis”. Understandably, many of the students in class had a quick and impassioned reaction to this term, and the class threatened to devolve into a shouting match. However, you were able to wrangle it back into order (well, as much control as any high school class has order). You admitted that the term had initially engendered a similar reaction in you, but that you took a deep breath and a moment to collect your thoughts and asked the student to clarify what he meant. While his further explanation left a lot to be desired, quashing that initial spark of emotion ended up allowing us to have a genuinely interesting conversation about feminism and areas it could go too far, fall short of its goals, and need to be reimagined. I remember this instance fondly, I think, because it's so out of place with our modern debate. Initial, emotional reactions are all we can muster today, partly due to the 24/7 news cycle. Nuance and understanding, even if it ends in continued disagreement, is lost to us. You and I never had this difficulty when we talked, so I’d never had the chance to see you so effectively reframe an outburst into a conversation before this. In fact, this is a skill I've seen multiple of my college professors fail to employ on the same level. To me, it’s a consistent reminder to slow my mind, take a breath, and listen to learn rather than to reply, and I think it has benefited me in many of my classes and my own learning. "" Throughout my career as an educator, I wanted all my students to know they belonged; they were entitled to their opinion (with facts cited to back them up of course) and that an open, honest discourse is necessary to maintain the health of a democratic society. I poignantly remember the days after the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 and a young man in my class proclaimed ""All of those people deserved to die. I don't feel sorry for any of them."" The class took a collective breath and my thoughts raced as the emotional outburst was surely one option, and yet I said. ""Can you please help me understand how you believe this and what led you to this conclusion?"" He explained himself - and it had to do with the events of Ruby Ridge and Waco, and by the end of the year, he apologized for his comments about Oklahoma City. That dear child was truly my teacher in helping me understand the skill of listening and asking more questions over assumptions and condemnation.","In the past five years, I have donated both time and money to national and state congressional campaigns.

With the passage of Amendment Y in 2018, we the citizens of Colorado blazed the trail by being one of the small handful of states (perhaps one fifth)  in our country with independent redistricting committees where the will of the people can be applied without direct political pressure or fear of influence. I feel this provides the rest of the citizens a perspective of democratizing the decision making when gerrymandering is a concern across the political spectrum. 

Being a registered independent ever since I first registered to vote, I feel my perspectives of having seen so many different cultures and people of different backgrounds gives me the empathetic foundation of both the right and the left. I do not believe I ever know more than everyone else about anything, but I enjoy the learning and the ability to get diverse ideas and personalities to come together for extremely relevant common causes like this. Our state is changing just like the rest of the world, and I feel my perspectives and experience working with people around our country and world coupled with my love for Colorado, will make it easier for the committee to be  the fair representation of the citizens in achieving its mission.","I’ve been involved in several civic and community organizations since 2015. 

My primary volunteer experience since 2015 has been as the Founder, Board Chair & Executive Director of the Colorado Fine Arts Association, a 501c3 non profit founded in 2011 whose mission is to increase cultural understanding between our local communities and South Asia through arts. Over the course of the past decade my team has been able to present close to 200 events presenting our events to thousands of coloradans and people around the world to promote our mission. 

The organizing aspect of this is the effort I’ve made successfully in collaborating with the local communities and gone beyond sustaining such a niche area. Our organization is today the second largest receiver of funds from our home counties scientific and cultural facilities district. 

In addition, I have served in multiple capacities as part of various governance board committees at my local charter school for several years since 2015.

For the past 3 years, I have been serving in the Home Owners Association, currently as the President, of my community, one of the largest communities in Broomfield. 

On a professional note, I’m regularly invited to present at various technology conferences and committees around the world.","I have had no political organization affiliation since 2015. However, I’m involved in several community organizations as listed below.

1. Founder, Board Chair and Executive Director of Colorado Fine Arts Association, Colorado’s premier 501c3 organization that is involved in bringing together local Colorado communities and South Asia through arts

4. Founder and Chief Technology Officer of a very popular worldwide website on the arts & culture","I have been fortunate to have worked in the high tech field around various software, semiconductor, financial and professional services companies and organizations for the past 3 decades. During this time, I have applied the analytical skills to make complex organizational and technical decisions that have a direct impact on the lives of millions of people around the world.

In my community organizational experience, the challenges are similar but different. The budgets are tighter, success is measured with a different set of OKRs and KPIs, but I've tried to manage community organizations with the same analytical approach to set the clear goals, agree on the metrics of success and tracking them and continuously improving.

Having managed large set of geographically dispersed diverse people as part of my team across various cultures and languages all working towards a common mission has given me significant insights into looking at all aspects of a problem and solving them by applying analytical skills of observing, listening, researching, interpreting the options as applicable to the problem domain and validating the hypotheses before building an eventual solution.

I have in-depth technical expertise and advanced training in computational science including a popular US patent, data analytics and cognitive science.

We all have unique perspectives we bring from our diverse background, but in order for any cause, community organization or our country to be successful, it is imperative that we find ways to work together under the guardrails provided for us to live in a civilized society. 

In my field of work, I deal with solving extremely challenging and complex technical problems. However, one thing I've learned is that even the most complex technical problems has an overwhelming people side to it. When faced with a situation like this, I use data as the backbone to build consensus. But, I do not believe that data alone is compelling as data can sometimes be manipulated to suit your point of view. This is where we have to find the middle ground that works reasonably well for everyone, not perfectly for a selected few.

I expect the commissioners to be truly representing the changing diverse culture of Colorado. They will be from different political, religious , gender identification, and other beliefs. It is extremely important that the eventual results are reflective of who we are. End of the day everyone irrespective of their race, education, opportunities and accomplishments want the same thing.

I have been interested in redistricting since college, when I participated in a 1985 project led by Common Cause in Indiana. I demonstrated that it was possible to create a city council district in South Bend, Indiana, that united much of the central-city African American community in one district rather than dispersing the members of that community among districts that extended from the center to outlying neighborhoods. I continued working with Common Cause in Indiana in a citizen-led effort to show how single-member state legislative districts could be created that respected jurisdictional boundaries. At that time, in the early 1990s, Indiana used multimember districts around some major cities that diluted the voting power of certain communities by merging them with outlying areas that would drown out their voice.
I resumed engaging with redistricting after my retirement from the Air Force. I provided comments on El Paso County Commissioner districts, where the process was particularly disturbing. The county would tweak its maps frequently, shuffling precincts to ensure that one party would win every seat. Sometimes a precinct would be swapped so frequently that its citizens would not be able to vote for commissioner for several cycles. In recent years, the county has gone to extremes to imagine communities of interest that are not based on the real identities of local citizens. My dismay at this process was one of the reasons I ran for County Clerk and Recorder in 2010.
After being defeated by Wayne Williams for county office, I actively participated in the public comments for 2010 statewide redistricting and also became involved in a successful effort to reduce the proportion of at-large city council seats from 5 of 9 to 3 of 9. Prior to this, no city council members were living in the central areas of the city. I then engaged with community groups to argue for a district that would unify the southeastern portion of the community, with its distinct interests, rather than splitting and dispersing that community among several districts.
My overall takeaway from these experiences is that elected officials have an inherent conflict of interest in redistricting: preserving their own power and that of their political party. These override an important principle of living in a democratic republic: that the voters select their representatives, not the other way around.","The longest and broadest example of such advocacy stems from my service to the Public Trustee Association of Colorado, on its board and on its legislative committee. Working with representatives of all 64 Colorado counties helped me develop a deeper understanding of the variety of interests in different parts of the state. While I represented a very large county, I recognized that proposals that might make sense in Colorado Springs would not meet the needs of rural counties. At the same time, I also learned how to help the elected officials in those counties understand the needs of the larger and urban counties. 
Since 2007, I have also advocated for the protection of public lands in Colorado. I helped lead an effort to map out the boundaries of a large roadless area in the Rampart Range and promote awareness of the recreational opportunities in that area. My work resulted in the addition of over 1000 acres to the roadless area by discovering mapping errors. I have continued my advocacy through developing and coordinating public comments on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management proposals and by helping Wild Connections develop reports on lands with wilderness characteristics. I also take direct action in this area: as a certified trail crew leader, I have led teams to design, build, and repair trails in El Paso, Teller, and Douglas counties.
From 2008-2014, I served as an at-large member of the Community Advisory Committee to the Pikes Peak Area Council of Governments. In that role, I heard the concerns of different groups within the region and helped evaluate priorities for infrastructure and parks.","Throughout the period, Conservation Chair of the Pikes Peak Group of the Colorado Mountain Club
2018-2019 Member of the Board of the Public Trustee Association of Colorado. Also served on the board earlier in the decade, and a member of the association throughout.
2008-2019 Public Trustee for El Paso County (appointed by Governors Ritter, Hickenlooper, and Polis)","I have strong mathematical and linguistic skills. I taught research methods for several years at the Air Force Academy and now coach graduate students through the development and execution of research projects. This requires me to help them use logic and reason to develop methods that will answer their questions.
While my graduate degrees are in political science, I am trained as an engineer. My Air Force acquisition assignments fell into the realm of systems engineering, which is defined by bringing logic and reason to problems. Early on, I conducted a safety analysis of the Air Force One wiring system that became the basis for a high-level decision not to retrofit the system because the risk was acceptable. Soon after that, I helped Strategic Air Command develop workable solutions to a problem with isocyanate hazards in missile maintenance facilities. Toward the end of my time in weapons system acquisition, I was in charge of ensuring that the implementation and installation of a new pilot training management system would meet the needs of the Air Force and the country.
I spent fall 2004 in Baghdad, where I served as the political strategist for the military coalition. To an even greater extent than other assignments, this work required me to obtain and synthesize a vast amount of information—on militias, the campaign plan, the Iraqi election, a Sunni Arab engagement strategy, and many other topics—and develop succinct summaries and recommendations for command. As one of the most junior officers in the strategy office, I had to rely on tight logic and reason when presenting information that was often not what senior leaders wanted to hear. This work was also conducted in a fairly high-stress environment.
A particular strength that sets me apart from others in these areas is my skill at mapping and spatial representation. While it may not translate directly to the work of a commission member, I am very good at understanding geographic relationships. Beyond my comments to public lands management plans, I am a skilled land navigator in the backcountry and have designed and constructed new trail alignments in the forest. Both of those tasks require an agility at abstract manipulation of space to understand how to best create a route, either for the day’s hike or for a trail. Similar abstract manipulations may be helpful in envisioning options for develop legislative districts that serve the interests of the people of Colorado.","I demonstrated my ability to be fair and impartial while I was serving as Public Trustee for El Paso County for 11 years. In that role, I had to ensure that my deputies and I administered foreclosure law fairly and equitably, setting aside any personal feelings about particular cases or how we might wish the law were different. 
I will be able to promote consensus and contribute to creating agreement because I am good at listening to others and understanding their interests and preferences. That allows me to reflect on their argument and show good faith by reconsidering my own positions and where they could be more in alignment with those of others. At the same time, I am able to couch my own views in ways that appeal to the values that others hold. This was particularly useful as a member of the Public Trustee Association Board and Legislative Committee, during which time most of my colleagues were elected officials of another political party and had been representing rural counties for many years.
My ability to promote consensus in those ways largely stems from my Air Force career, as described in more detail in the next answer. In most assignments, I was by rank the junior person even when I was a peer on the organization chart. That meant that the only way I could promote safety, design decisions, or a wartime engagement strategy was by persuasive discussion and making sure that I had data to back up my position. I also found it helpful to let others take credit for my ideas as if they were their own rather than merely coming into agreement with me. These experiences also taught me to engage when I thought it really mattered and hold off from trying to get my way for its own sake. 
I have also used these skills to build coalitions during public lands discussion periods. While environmental groups share broad common goals, they do differ in their priorities. It was important to find ways to get several groups to sign on to a single letter rather than taking divergent positions that would not help land managers reach the decision we preferred. The comments I developed for these federal decisions were always richly detailed in maps and coordinates that provided rich detail about facts on the ground that were the basis of our response.","I ran for El Paso County Clerk and Recorder in 2010 (lost).

I have NEVER belonged to a political party, and I absolutely revile the use of government systems to benefit any political party. The idea that political parties have used their power to redraw district lines to benefit the parties is in my mind the antithesis of what a representative democracy should be. And while I don't believe that Colorado has a major Gerrymandering problem like other states do, I don't want Colorado to have such a problem in the future.

Additionally, as a resident of very rural Clear Creek County, I believe that I can bring a ""mountain perspective"" to the commission. I also am privileged enough to enjoy a career and a job that would allow me to participate in this critical process, without major disruption of my professional life or paycheck.

Helped draft a campaign ethics bill for the city/county of Denver (the bulk of it's language was adopted as Denver Referred Measure 2E) working with other non-partisan and cross-partisan groups to draft said language. I have circulated petitions for a small number of ""good governance"" measures (the Denver Democracy for the People Initiative--that became 2E). I have supported Colorado ""good governance"" measures to include Amendments Y and Z (for example: https://denverite.com/2018/10/18/jennifer-lawrence-wants-you-to-illegalize-gerrymandering-in-colorado/).

International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 357 (airline union)--union member (and previous executive board member)
Air Line Pilots Association--union member","My professional life consists of taking a packet of information (weather, aircraft mechanical state, airport conditions, terrain considerations, and in some cases geopolitical considerations) and distilling that information into a useable plan to accomplish a given task (to fly from point A to B). This involves the rest of the flight crew I am operating with (I have been a captain, first officer, and relief pilot at various times, all of which involve different leadership gradients), a dispatcher with joint responsibility, and many other entities during complex flights. All of this must end up with a consensus on how we should operate the flight. From the moment that plan is agreed to, it is continually monitored and re-evaluated, and adjusted should conditions warrant. All of this while weighing pros and cons, and operating under a continually ticking clock and continually depleting fuel reserves. In less time critical situations (which is how the commission would operate), I tend to prioritize a task by critical criteria, starting with what seems most pressing. Once prioritized, I seek to apply any desirable criteria--especially if I am working with others who might rank the criteria differently than I do. And once a workable plan appears to be presented, I seek ways to test that plan against the criteria, and adjust it if necessary.","I have spent over 10,000 hours flying airplanes, which is mostly an exercise in assessing information, and building consensus amongst the operating crew members, a skill that I have honed to a pretty high degree. I also served a term as an elected leader for a pilots union (IBT Local 357), during one of the most contentious bargaining environments in Railway Labor Act history. It was one of the driving factors for me running for that position, and I largely acted as the ""independent"" board member making peace between factions on our board. As part of my experience in union representation, I eventually developed the skills to handle EXTREMELY sensitive discussions (including high stakes discipline, substance abuse issues, harassment cases, hostile membership, and negotiations) respectfully amongst parties who typically displayed open disdain for one another. 

As a dyed in the wool independent, I would be unencumbered by partisan pressures entirely, while being naturally inclined towards consensus building as the most effective form of agreement. I operate in a world that requires a shared mental model and buy in of any decision in an airplane, it's a way of life for me, and has been for over 20 years in my professional life. I also like to think that I am really good at letting bygones be bygones. A disagreement with another person on one topic does not need to effect other attempts to build consensus with that person, and it is incredibly important to disagree without being disagreeable with one another. I basically cannot recall the last time I disagreed with someone I was working on the same task with--I believe because my skills at building a shared mental model lead to consensus so efficiently that things never rise to the level of a real disagreement. Impartiality is achieved both by my fierce non partisan belief and lifelong devotion to non partisanship, along with the inclusion of fairness and impartiality as critical criteria to work for. People are allowed to have their own beliefs (including partisan motivations that I might agree or disagree with), but that does not necessarily mean that their viewpoint is not valid and deserving of thoughtful consideration.","Represent.US

Longmont spent the better part of a decade represented by an individual from Lafayette and an individual from Boulder even though the town of Longmont itself would've been big enough to have one district dedicated entirely to the town, a seat that would've been competitive and would've guaranteed the election of a Longmont resident.

My husband and I moved to Colorado 20 years ago from Iowa where we had lived all our lives. Being able to move to Colorado was a dream come true. Finding Durango, was not what we anticipated, but it was just right for us.
But what we did not expect, was that our nightly television news would come from New Mexico, and that we would come to know more initially about Albuquerque than we would about Denver; more about New Mexico politics than we would about Colorado’s; and more about the government and the governor of New Mexico than we would about our newly adopted state’s. Especially in Election years it’s easy to feel overlooked and disconnected if you live in La Plata County. Over time, however, we’ve come to appreciate New Mexico, but we’ve had to make effort to know and find out about Colorado and what’s happening here, how things work here, and who our elected officials are. As a consequence, I think we have paid more attention and gotten more involved than we ever were previously.
We have always enjoyed getting out and exploring, and I think there may be a county in Colorado that we have not been in, but I’d have to look carefully to find it.
I think I am aware of the diversity of our very large state, and I am familiar with not only the geography of it’s various parts, but of the people and how they live and make their livelihoods; not only the Western Slope (which was a new concept and distinction to me), but the Front Range and Eastern Plains as well. I’ve acquainted myself with all parts of the state, maybe even more so than a native might, because we were transplants who wanted to be here, and to participate in this great state.
Being sure that each and every person is fairly represented is not an easy goal to attain, but I believe that it should done with as much fairness and convenience as possible, and I would pledge to do to the best of my ability, and be honored to be involved in the endeavor.

Recently, our state and nation has experienced notable division on numerous cultural, political and economic issues. We have a lot of challenges that our government might possibly address. It all begins with our citizens feeling and, in fact, being represented. The redistricting process must be interpreted as proper and reasonable. The resulting districts are the basis for representation to our government and the foundation of political participation. I believe in the principle of fair representation, that I can be impartial and respectful of the rights of Colorado citizens. Serving as a member of this commission would be an honor and opportunity for worthy investment in our democracy.","As part of the Highlands Ranch Community Association (HRCA) Backcountry Planning Areas Advisory Committee, I was part of the effort to create a Community Involvement Process to represent the various interests of homeowners, developers and the community association for proposed/allowed development in Highlands Ranch open space areas. The final process acknowledged the frequently competing interests of stakeholders while providing for balanced dissemination, review and comment. This reasoned approach was tailored to work within prescribed HRCA and county structures while providing for project revision opportunities and evaluation of whether to advance to the next step in the process. I’ve learned that success is greatly enhanced when the group’s goals are first and foremost in mind. Whether it’s a community or school advisory committee or planning/leading numerous mission trips to the Czech Republic, I’ve found that understanding the human, material and structural resources available and anticipating possible difficulties lead to the best organizational outcomes.

Understanding what you want to accomplish and the information you have is essential to solving any problem. For example, during my college engineering education, I came to understand if you didn’t have the correct data or the right equation for the necessary analysis, no matter what you did, you wouldn’t really be getting anywhere. So rather than wasting time, I discovered it was important to define the goal and go about gathering the data required. Turns out that it’s also necessary to assess progress towards solving the problem. Am I still headed in the right direction? As an airline pilot, during an airborne emergency situation, it’s imperative, also, to define the problem. Through and training experience, I’m continually getting better at defining what the problem might be and methods on how to solve it. I also realize that I can call on experts to provide data and recommendations to help me make the best decision.","The most important aspect of creating consensus and agreement within the commission is to keep the redistricting criteria in mind. It’s a given that there will be differing, yet reasonable, opinions on certain issues among commission members. I think it’s important to recognize the value of other’s ideas and evaluate how that idea affects moves the commission towards the ultimate goal of creating fair and legal congressional districts. For example, as an airline captain, I’m tasked with making the best (safest) decision in any given situation. Consequently, I typically consider the given circumstances as I see them and call on the input of other personnel, whether they be a copilot, flight attendant, dispatcher or air traffic controller. Sometimes the best decision is not the one I originally envisioned, but one that’s enhanced with the perspective of someone who might see things from a different angle. I’ve found that making the BEST decision usually involves consulting others. The best decisions typically move toward more durable and fruitful success. I have the practiced ability to periodically step back from a discussion or situation, evaluate how the process is going, communicate my perspective and continue moving forward to accomplishing a safe flight, or in this case, the commission’s charter.","No organized political activity, donations to Dan Ward/ 2018 Virginia US House primary election and Act Blue PAC in 2020",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/2033,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/legislative/2033.html

DDS University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill","I feel our biggest political problem in this country is the Gerrymandering of congressional districts. A two-party political system with noncompetitive districts means primaries become too polarized. Candidates only must compete with a staunch base and not have to compete with the general population. That leads to a polarized legislative body unwilling to compromise with the opposing party. Scott Tipton was an effective, conservative representative for the 3rd District of Colorado but the hard-core base that shows up for primaries elected what I consider a ""fringe"" candidate. This has made the traditionally very conservative 3rd district competitive for Democrats. It should not take a ""fringe"" candidate's election in a primary to make a district competitive. They should always be competitive between the two parties they represent.","I feel that I have reached a point in my life where my commitments to my children and family have freed me up now to be able to devote time and give back to my community. I thought I had reached this point in 2016 when my youngest son graduated high school and was heading to Cal Poly for college but the injury, he suffered altered everything. He suffered a C-5/C-6 cervical neck fracture and is now quadriplegic. This injury changed everything for our entire family. His perseverance has pushed him forward and he is now in his senior year at CU Boulder and he has progressed immensely in developing his independence. There are still many challenges for him and my wife and I but I feel that I’m now able to look beyond the world we’ve had to adapt to over these last four years. The challenges we’ve faced have ranged from medical emergencies, to adapting living spaces, navigating government services, and providing reassurances when none seemed possible, all the while maintaining a dental practice that allows me to provide the income needed to overcome the many financial burdens. I’ve needed to juggle so many competing challenges that have made me more pragmatic and empathetic to issues we all must face.","Due to family commitments over the past 4 years I have had little time to volunteer to any organizations outside of career associated groups. My son experienced a cervical neck fracture shortly after graduating from high school in 2016 that left him in a wheelchair and quadriplegic. These last four years have been a challenge for our family, and I have devoted all my free time towards helping him achieve the goal of going to CU Boulder and completing college.","My undergraduate degree was Chemistry and prior to attending Dental School I worked for 3 years as an environmental engineer.

Administrator - LPL Properties","BA, Political Science, English minor, Colorado State University","I wish to serve on this commission because I deeply believe in our American system of representative government.  I hold a political science degree from Colorado State University.  During the course of my studies, I participated in the Legislative Internship Program, and was paired with the late State Senator Claire Traylor.  Senator Traylor was a Jefferson County Republican, and member of the Joint Budget Committee.  It was a great honor to learn from her how local and state policy making work.  This was before politics became so wickedly divisive. I witnessed someone with strong political convictions, which weren’t overly partisan, legislate in a responsible and respectable manner. It was during this time that I built a foundational belief in policy making that is incremental and consensus built. Over the past decade or so, our elected officials have moved away from this manner of legislating. I also believe that common people like me, with enough experience to understand how policy is made, but removed enough to be free of agenda and institutional political influence, are in the best position to advise on issues and policy that drive our representational government. I am so excited that Colorado is leading the way to restore districting back to a representational, not political process.
To this end, my work in advocacy for equitable public education funding has lead me to believe that our state and country has some work to do beyond just education equity. Non-partisan political districting is a fundamental way to achieve greater equity in our governmental representation.

I also understand Colorado and Coloradans, living here for all but the first (4) years of my life.  I understand what ‘Colorado Republican’ is. I experience the bluer wave happening in our more urban and suburban areas. And all the unaffiliated and smaller party members. I know old school Denver, when it was a ‘cow town’. I entered my young adulthood as the city of Denver became more cosmopolitan. I interacted with our agricultural and ranching communities while attending Colorado State.  I remember when skiing on the weekends didn’t involve a 4 hour drive, and the direction you put your skies atop your car said something about where you came from. I’ve grown as our microbrew industry has grown, and our outdoor recreation industry became more sophisticated.  Many don’t think of Colorado as being particularly diverse.  I know this isn’t true. And I believe voices from all of those sector of Colorado society and culture deserve representation on this commission.","I have participated and lead community advocacy in a few different capacities.  I was first drawn into public education advocacy when I began volunteering at my children’s school.  As I learned more about the state of Colorado’s public services funding mechanisms, I began to see what great inequity exists in our public schools, due in large part to lack of adequate funding. I began to participate with Great Education Colorado, learning as much as I was able about how to repair these inadequacies. I began to talk to anyone who would listen about what was happening, and what the voters of Colorado needed to correct course. I was a vocal community supporter and advocate for Amendment 73.
As a steering committee member of both our local school district’s bond and mill levy override campaigns, I advocated in a more formal manner to encourage members of my community to vote yes on these measures. I also formed an ad hoc committee of community members to organize and advocate for our neighborhood’s interests during the redistricting of boundaries in our school district. My interest and participation in our district’s accountability committee was borne from a passion for representing the interests of my children’s school. Through these experiences, the greatest lesson I have learned it that the best advocacy, whether in a formal or informal capacity, is respectful and informed discourse between people, even those that disagree. In my opinion, it is most profound way to create impactful change.","Citizens For LPS Debt Free Schools mill levy override campaign steering committee member, 2020

In my view, data is the most impartial place to begin a conversation around how to build new districts.  My strength however, is the ability to understand different perspectives in a fundamental way, while withholding judgement if those perspectives are different than mine.  I am also a natural mediator, process oriented manager and big picture thinker. Perhaps most of all, I understand people.  Most of us on some level are motivated by a basic desire to be heard and understood. When members of a group experience this level of understanding, they tend to be able to work together better and more productively, because a basic level of trust and cooperation exists. I think this would be one of my greatest contributions to the commission.","The ad hoc group of community members I formed is the best way to demonstrate my ability to build consensus.  Due to unusual school locations in the LPS district, our neighborhood was quite a distance from our home school, which created a situation where many people chose to enroll their children in closer-by schools.  This was a detriment to both our neighborhood community and our school community, but easy to understand why parents would make this choice. So with the prospect of a newer, nearby school opening due to the passage of a bond in 2018, I called on a group of 15 parents, mostly moms, to collectively advocate for our neighborhood to attend that school together.  Initial drafts of these boundaries split our neighborhood in two, which we had already experienced the negative impacts of. When considering the formation of this committee, one thing stood out to me; while I would be the person who organized the group, and the relationships I’d built in the district would be helpful, this needed to be a collective, communal effort. I wanted the direction of our advocacy efforts to be informed by what best represented the wishes of our neighborhood.  Parents with young children, maybe not even yet in school needed to be included. Parents who had children who had gone through the schools in a divided neighborhood need to be included.  And with those perspectives, a collective mission and voice was built.  Everyone had the chance to share ideas around what they wished to see and the best way to move forward. Everyone had the chance to contribute their strengths, whether it be letter writing, new map formation, local property value expertise, or representing the potential negative impact on other school communities.

I believe that I am a good listener but also have the ability to ask probing questions that help better define what the root issue or desire is. Learning as much as possible about an issue can make one appear fair or impartial but still negatively impact others who may not have representation. Just because a decision or process appears impartial on the surface does not mean it is fair in practice because existing conditions may not allow for true equality in an outcome. It will be interesting to see how decisions about fairness are implemented at a micro and macro level, and where the tradeoffs happen. Consensus has to be the goal from the beginning, not unanimity. Not everyone will be happy with all of the decisions that are made but I believe that a good map can be designed if members are willing to compromise.","In 1992 I worked on the Dick Lamm US Senate primary campaign and Pat Schroeder US House of Representatives general election campaign.

Now the citizens of the state have made concrete efforts to move the redistricting process out of politics and government (per se.) I believe individuals such as myself should volunteer to take the experience, training, and leadership learned over years of making people and systems work correctly and put those skills to use making the redistricting work for the citizens, not the politicized governmental establishment. All Colorado citizens deserve to have themselves and their neighbors properly represented in our fantastic democratic republic. Colorado is diverse from many different perspectives - some rural some urban, some mountains - some plains, some agriculture - some energy, some business – some labor, etc. The list goes on. Each perspective deserves the ability to express its collective, and sometimes unique, needs, desires, & contributions, via both the federal and state representations. Who wouldn’t want to be part of that?","In addition to the GOP County Central Committee above, I have been active in the non-profit Rocky Mountain Wing (RMW) Commemorative Air Force (CAF) serving on the Wing Staff as both Education Officer and as the Wing Newsletter Editor.

I also successfully campaigned to have the Wing's Grumman TBM Avenger Torpedo Bomber certified as both a Colorado State Historical Object and a National Historic Object (airplane), one of only two that regularly continue to fly.

I never considered flying these aircraft a ""profession"" but rather a diversion to hone both my mental skills as well as improve and maintain my piloting skills. Without question, piloting today's aircraft in ""the crowded skies"" requires logic and reasoning skills above the norm. Most piloting (with perhaps the exception of crop dusting)can be hours of boredom interspersed with moments of terror! Those moments of terror require logic and reasoning skills way beyond those necessary to put together a contract for a worldwide computer packet switching network. Operating within one environment compliments the other - I speak from experience in both cases. Gathering known reliable and meaningful data, using demonstrated means to analyze the data for information pertinent to the problem at hand, applying the information in acceptable means, and then making sound decisions based on the data - not other outside emotionally charged input - is the path to success - both in the cockpit and the boardroom. That same logic and decision path will serve the redistricting commission, and Colorado's diverse citizenship very well.","I spent my entire professional career negotiating - establishing consensus between groups and individuals.

For instance, a parent comes to me and says her 3 year old son cannot recognize the difference between numbers and letters and blames the teacher for lack of instruction. I know, developmentally, that children do not tend to learn these things until age 4-5. I contact the teacher to see what lessons she is presenting to the children regarding numbers and letters. She shows me how she introduces them one at a time through a game. I do some research and find that new concepts must be presented at least 500 times to children 3-5 years old before a concept gets incorporated into their brains. I sit down with both the teacher and parent and present what is happening in the classroom and what I found in my research.

Our task force wrote a proposal for consideration by Colorado's 208 commission on healthcare reform.  This proposal was later written as legislation that was presented in the Colorado legislator in 2009 and 2010.  We worked with business and community organizations and health care trade associations to articulate the significant issues in our healthcare system.  This advocacy for rational reform in healthcare, which would actually reduce the overall cost of the system, and the cost in the system to governments, business and individuals, has been revived this year.  In 2010 I cofounded and chaired the Coalition for Effective Healthcare a 501C4. 
 In 2012, at the request of the South Metro Chamber Board of Directors I wrote a white paper on the significant challenges for business of Colorado's very complex sales tax system.  That white paper was presented to the then Colorado State Senate President.  That led to my personal advocacy with mayors, Colorado Department of Revenue and some legislators.  Ultimately, after soliciting the involvement of American Furniture Warehouse and Colorado Automobile Dealers Association, we interested businesses and trade organizations in joining the effort to fix Colorado's Sales Tax System.  We formed the Coalition to Simplify Colorado Sales Tax, a 501c4.  The Coalition, working with legislators, has participated in the writing of and advocacy of 5 bills that have all passed the legislature and are step by step moving Colorado toward a far more user friendly sales tax system, that is revenue neutral, at worst, and very well may generate more sales tax revenue for the state and home rule cities.","State of Colorado Task Force to Simplify Colorado Sales Tax 2017 to present; Vice President Board, Coalition to Simplify Colorado Sales Tax; Board Member Cornerstone Productions, 2014 to present; South Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce, National Federation of Independent Business","With my healthcare reform advocacy, we engaged political leaders, business organizations, and even healthcare trade associations.  This is a really difficult issue to rally interested parties toward a common solution.  The actual fix to the healthcare system problems, is not that challenging.  Aligning the various players is very challenging.  The businesses of healthcare themselves are the most difficult to move as the American Healthcare industry is the largest industry on the planet with significant players who have a major financial stake in the structure of our system.  We were able to achieve alignment with many at the table including advocates for a single payer healthcare system, with whom we found significant common ground.  As part of my work in this area, I was a significant contributor to the legislation that enabled the Colorado healthcare insurance exchange.

I am a business owner and prior to owning my business was the Colorado senior executive of a company with 650 Colorado employees.  I have consistently in my life faced challenges that required analysis, consideration of multiple courses of action, developing strategic direction and decision making and implementing strategic plans.    We have successfully navigated very difficult situations.  2008-2010 was very difficult for most businesses.  We were no exception.  We developed strategies to navigate our business through a significant recession.    the shutdown of much of our economy as a result of Covid 19 has brought a whole new set of challenges that required fast assessment of the looming problem, multiple options to address the business challenges, selecting a go forward set of plans and implementing it.  Our business has been dramatically impacted by Covid.  Today, we have as many employees as when the pandemic first resulted in stay at home orders.  Our outlook for the future is strong as we have made and implement many decisions that have preserved our company and positioned us for future success.","In my sales tax simplifications advocacy I have met with and been in meetings with all stakeholders in the sales tax system - the Colorado Department of Revenue, Colorado Municipal League, individual Home Rule cities, counties, Colorado legislature, business trade organizations and individual businesses.  We were able to listen, respond to disparate interests, find common ground and common objectives and move the ball progressively toward a much better sales tax system for the state of Colorado.

During these years, I collaborated and joined other student organizations, La Xicana and MechA, in an effort to recruit and retain minority students on campus.  Our prize project was the La Alma de la Raza Curriculum Project, financed by President Clinton's Goals 2000 Grant program.  And during all this advocating, I obtained and developed new skills - the drafting of curriculum, the handling/bookkeeping of large and small state academic budgets, academic student recruitment, the handling of faculty searches, the hiring of part-time faculty, and interestingly, the handling of graduation agreements.

Working in the public sector can provide either great satisfaction or disarray; as a representative of our government, I feel, it is my duty to assure a consensus is not just heard, but heeded, by our administrators.  If disarray is visualized or experienced, advocates should be supplied to counter or meet the disorganization/disagreement.   Consensus is achieved by finding the middle ground, ideas that meet both or all parties needs; then working toward a mutual agreement on those outliers, merging them or redefining them, possibly allowing a better consensus.

I am committed to my community for which I have lived at the same address for thirty-five years. My family lives on a small acreage in unincorporated Larimer County just outside of Berthoud.

The unfairness of it can cause apathy and antipathy that lead to civic disengagement and civil unrest. For all their promise, Amendments Y and Z are not the end-all of redistricting reform, but they give Coloradans a shot at a fairer, more transparent process that can help reinforce the legitimacy of our system.

With so many factors at play, “fairness” (in terms of the final map) will be difficult to define and more difficult to achieve. But in Amendments Y and Z, the citizens of Colorado have provided a set of criteria that the commission must work to faithfully balance as they evaluate and provide feedback on proposed maps. They must also work actively to identify, understand, and accommodate communities of interest. I hope to go in clear-eyed on the challenges that come with this task and ensure that we make use of the analytical methods available as we work through this difficult, but necessary, process.","In Colorado, I've organized, represented, and advocated for the Secular Hub--a nonprofit community center for atheists, agnostics, humanists and their families. Bringing experience from volunteer leadership positions in Texas and Arizona, I co-founded the Secular Hub's Community Service Committee, organizing a team of community members to create volunteer and fundraising opportunities and to provide support for members of our community. As the Board Chair and as a POC for outreach events, I represented the organization at public events hosted at our facility and at local festivals like the People's Fair and PrideFest. As a participant in a lobby day at the U.S. Capitol, I shared my community's concerns about pending legislation with the staff for Senator Gardner and Representative DeGette.

I’ve also encouraged increased civic participation in our community by hosting debate viewing parties, a ballot measure Q&A (with an advocate and an opponent), and a Civics lesson with former State Senator Lois Court. More recently, I invited Dr. Beth Malmskog, an assistant professor of mathematics from Colorado College, to speak on how to use mathematics to assess the fairness of proposed district maps.","Secular Hub (a community for atheists, agnostics, humanists, and other nonbelievers):  Member, 2013-present; Founder, Community Service Committee, 2014; Board Member, 2016-2018; Board Chair, 2016-2017","Early in the COVID pandemic, I actively tracked, plotted, and shared information about the spread of the disease. I derived the formula for the exponential doubling rate to track how effectively we were bending the curve and sent (unsolicited) feedback to CDPHE on discrepancies I found in their data. More recently, to answer growing skepticism and my own uncertainty about whether COVID deaths could have been overstated (conflated with other comorbidities), I sought out data on monthly deaths in the US from all causes over the last 20 years and compared them to provisional data from this year. Plotting it, I was able to convince myself and some of my skeptical friends that this year is, indeed, quite an outlier. 

An analytical approach is in my nature and it is what my internal compass compels.

When possible, I try to go straight to the source(s), using intermediaries, analysts, and pundits in a supporting role. While they all have important information to provide, they also necessarily apply their own filters in selecting, organizing, and interpreting the information they communicate. When possible, I try to identify and ask challenging questions that get at the heart of the matter; ensure that due diligence was performed; and reveal weaknesses in assumptions, methodologies, and in interpretations and results.

Both my formal education and work life (in aerospace and software engineering) have had an analytical skew. My education led me to informal studies of deductive and inductive reasoning (i.e. the reasoning of mathematical proofs and of the sciences, respectively). An interest in political discourse led to informal readings on logical fallacies, cognitive biases, and heuristics, as well as the role of nonrational processes in political persuasion. I am no mathematician, but I do have some experience with (and an interest in) statistics, which I think will come in handy for this work. A recent personality/work styles profile (that I cannot endorse, but will mention) identified “analytical” as my dominant thinking style. And I relish opportunities to use my brain in analytical ways (even in non-standard ways, like in a recent review of professional journal articles on evidence-based volunteer coordination practices).","In various leadership and non-leadership positions, I have experienced some of the challenges of working with people with deeply held and diverse viewpoints. Staying clear on our purpose and the constraints in which we are operating will be important to keep the team aligned. As I engage, I work to avoid letting my ego get in the way of progress and I try to focus on getting to the best solution (wherever and whoever it is coming from). Being forthright, modeling humility and open-mindedness (by demonstrating a willingness to be swayed by new information), and keeping a goal-orientation can go a long way in eliciting the same behavior from others.

Filter bubbles--political or otherwise--rarely lead their inhabitants to broad-based understanding, much less fairness. Unaffiliated committee members will play an important role in helping hold the committee accountable, provided those (unaffiliated) members can show that they are well-informed and focused on faithfully performing their duty.

As a demonstration of impartiality (or at least an interest in it), I am an intermittent attendee at local house district meetings for both the Republican and Democratic parties. I do that because we all have blindspots, and hearing facts, values, and framings from multiple perspectives can help reveal some of my own blindspots. It has also shown that while the issues that divide us are often amplified in the media and in our minds, when it comes to many of the issues that face us, we have a lot in common.","I vote and have made donations to causes friends are passionate about.

From developing authentic collections and embracing the needs of diverse patrons to budget considerations within unique tax districts, the focus on analyzing data enabled me to chart a clear path for providing relevant and productive library service for all. My ability to apply logic and reason to a problem is perhaps best illustrated by my work as a reader for the College Board’s Advanced Placement United States History exam. As a reader, our job is to read and score (according to a pre-set rubric) student’s essays answering one topic question during a seven day session that begins each day at 8am and ends at 5pm. The same question over and over, but answered by high school students from all over the country (as well as those attending international schools). We each read hundreds of essays daily by students whose skill sets vary wildly. Our goal as readers is to award the students for what they know – not punish them for what they omit or get wrong. Many times logic dictates that the student answered the prompt correctly, looking at their writing holistically, and even though there might be minor errors in their writing. Reason takes that logic by the hand and reminds us as readers that the student wrote the essay in 45 minutes, under extreme pressure and without prior knowledge of the prompt. So when we spend the two to three minutes reading and scoring each essay we embrace that reason and logic and our goal to benefit the student’s effort is realized.","I will promote consensus by being patient in listening to all points of view expressed and by maintaining flexibility in my own opinions. I believe my career as a public school teacher has helped shape my skills in this regard. High School students share their thoughts and opinions about absolutely everything. An integral part of being a good teacher is listening to what they have to say without verbal or visual signs of judgement, and then working towards an answer, resolution or consideration. This skill was, and is, often tested when what is said clashes with my own ideas or realities. That is where the work gets more difficult and can be more rewarding. Often in committee meetings, parent conferences, as well as mentoring new teachers, the same patience and honest listening is needed. Especially in these challenging times, I have no doubt that building agreement with any diverse group of people will be difficult. I believe with my personal history and experience I am up to the task.","My past political activity has mostly involved teaching my high school Social Studies students about local, state, national government, civic participation and the U.S. Constitution. When applicable, I have encourage my senior students to register to vote. In line with district policy, I have always presented a non-partisan view in my teaching as well as in my professional profile. As a registered Independent voter I have been fortunate and honest in regarding the issues behind ballot measures and candidates, as opposed to being influenced along party lines. I vote given every opportunity not only because it is a privilege to do so, but also because I am answerable to my students as a person of responsibility and leadership. I have not consciously donated money to any political campaign or organization. I was a member of the teacher’s union DCTA and I withheld monies from them that were being directed politically.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/522,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/legislative/522.html

Voting has always been important in my family, but I would not have considered myself “political”. My dad was involved in town council in Pine Haven Wyoming and my aunt was mayor of Pine Knoll Shores in North Carolina.  They both leaned Republican and many in my family still are Republicans. I aligned with the Democratic Party in 2008 because I wanted to help with the convention.  As I have become more involved, I more closely align with the Democratic platform, such as health care and environmental protections than with the traditional Republican platform of less government involvement and conservative social values. With my background, I have cultivated skills that have built fairness and impartially in my core values.
I struggle with the current administration and it is my hope that after November there will be an increased desire for people to work together for the common good.  We can begin this ideal by working together locally. A couple of years ago, I attended an event at the Denver Film Society in which one of the panelists was Eleanor Clift, a Washington journalist.  She proposed that the intense political division was created in part because people did not know each other at the personal level. She mentioned that Tip O’Neill and Reagan could be friends because they created opportunities to be together after work.  With today’s politicians leaving Washington as soon as work is over and not cultivating after work relationships, the camaraderie is lost.  I will suggest that the commission meet on a non-formal basis to cultivate relationships with each other.

This experience was a launch pad for me to start my own non-profit called Zero Waste Services. For four years Zero Waste Services strived to increase waste diversion and recycling in Jefferson County. Our largest endeavor was to improve the recycling and composting efforts for Festival Italiano, an event that hosts 100,000 patrons each year.

I was a Park Ranger for Colorado Parks and Wildlife for ten years requiring me to be a certified Colorado Peace Officer and uphold the law in a nonbiased manner. I took my oath very seriously and treated all people with respect and dignity, striving to find common sense solutions to the various challenges I faced. This held true with the park management side of the job as well where I worked to address the needs of all park user groups.  I worked all over the State of Colorado, affording me the opportunity to truly get to know and appreciated the diverse makeup of our state. 

I also served as a Regional Representative for US Senator Michael Bennet, covering six counties across the western slope. I was a representative for all constituents, regardless of political background and I worked to ensure all voices were heard. I was a constituent advocate first and foremost and I came to understand the various challenges and opportunities that each individual, community and county faced. Finally, I now work for a nonprofit focused on river restoration in the west for the benefit of the multitude of communities who rely on them. I help to facilitate complex conversations with many user groups, figuring out ways to collaborate and work together to promote restoration work.

I have also been a youth mountain bike coach and mentor for several years, particularly for young girls.

I oversee all of the programs within the organization, each of which have different staff and partners who are involved, and unique grant funding and fundraising associated with them. On a small scale, I am the project manager for all of the secured grants at any given time, requiring me to track budgets, reporting, meeting deliverables and ensuring contracting is in place and payments occur in a timely fashion. I then look beyond secured funding, working with a fundraising coordinator to strategically plan for current funding gaps and look to how to fund future needs with the direction of the programs. From an organizational perspective, I ensure that each program is running successfully and in line with the current strategic plan. Often times, I analyze budgets both short term and long term to assess sustainability and whether or not it makes sense to continue with certain program aspects or divert to other opportunities both in terms of potentially diversifying funding, and providing additional professional development opportunities for staff.

The creative analytical skills that I am able to utilize at the nonprofit has been extremely rewarding for me. I really enjoy thinking outside of the box and I am a big picture thinker. If something doesn’t make sense as to why or how we are doing something, I am not afraid to ask the difficult questions as to why and look for other solutions.  My team was having a difficult time keeping track of so many disparate grant budgets so I researched possible solutions. I organized and talked with various consultants and integrated a budget tracking system into a grant management program we were already utilizing. 

Finally, I have strong communication skills. I help guide and lead various collaborative, watershed groups throughout the southwest, from small place-based groups to large multi- state, regional collaboratives. These groups are built on consensus building and are at various stages in their lifespan- some have been around for over a decade and some are just getting started. I help staff and partners think through intended outcomes and objectives, create strong meeting agendas, and navigate discussions, helping to keep them on task.","I will promote consensus among the commissioners by first and foremost being an active listener and respecting all opinions and perspectives, while keeping the main objective in mind. Diverse ideas and experiences are truly a strength when trying to find an outcome that will serve a multitude of people in a large geographic area. As a Regional Representative for Senator Bennet, I led a serious of health care roundtables throughout the western slope. The opinions and emotions at these meetings were highly contentious and I would lay out the ground rules of being respectful and allowing anyone who wanted to speak to have the floor.  Being empathetic to individual experiences was truly key, but the follow up and asking clarifying questions so the entire group could understand where the person was coming from was even more important. Getting to the ‘why’ and talking through this allowed for civil discourse. 

As an Associate Director for a nonprofit, I oversee a group of professional staff from various backgrounds, working in various geographic areas across Colorado and Arizona. I lead large, grant development projects, where often times, staff have very different opinions on what the project components should like, who to engage and collaborate with, whether or not the project promotes the long-term strategic plan and how much risk should be taken.  I ensure that all staff are first and foremost engaged and participate in every planning discussion. I also make sure everyone has a chance to articulate their thoughts, being respectful to differing personalities and learning styles and trying to make the atmosphere comfortable. This allows me to sift through a possible project outline by treating everyone fairly, and through open dialogue, also making sure we are staying true to the intended outcome. 

Through my background in law enforcement and park management, as a representative for a US Senator and as a leader for a nonprofit organization working with a diverse group of staff, stakeholders, as well as my involvement with the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board, I have been afforded the opportunity to learn and excel in various environments as a sensible, fair and unbiased leader.","I have been an active and informed voter since I was eligible to vote.

Fairly drawn maps are a pillar to making sure Colorado is prosperous and equitable for all who live here, not just those who live in the right district. 

I view drawing fair maps as the first part of a cycle. If districts are created fairly, then leaders who truly represent their communities will be elected. Citizens will feel their needs are being met and their lives will improve, and they will be more inclined to participate in democracy by voting and holding their elected leaders accountable.

However, both parties have strayed so far to the extremes that I don't feel like I have a real choice anymore, and I know there are many other people who feel the same way.  I've found in my relatively short lifetime that when two sides are very far apart, 80% of the time the best course of action is somewhere in between.  Right now, the loudest sides of both parties drown out any calls from moderates to have civil dialogue and actually create compromises.  There are many reasons why this has happened (media and social media bubbles on both sides, the current primary system weeding out moderates, etc...), but one of the primary factors is partisan gerrymandering leading to non-competitive districts.

This independent redistricting commission gives me hope that it's possible to make non-partisan districts that are truly competitive and where each citizen's vote has the same impact no matter where they reside.  I'm a firm believer in the statement ""citizens should choose their representatives, not the other way around,"" and this commission, if run correctly, is a good step in the right direction for this state.  It's one of the few ways I've seen available for moderate citizens like me to be involved in a meaningful way, and I would be honored to be a part of this effort.

MA Early Childhood Special Education, CU-Denver 2006","Having worked with diverse families as an educator, I have some insight into the social challenges faced by people who have languages, experiences, and cultures different from my own. 
Having my own children (who both have moderate special needs) and having to advocate on their behalf has increased my confidence in understanding dense legal jargon related to special education law (even moreso than when I was a teacher) and has given me insight into the struggles others face in simply trying to gain equal footing.

It's no surprise that our country is divided on many issues currently, so having the opportunity to do something cooperative and beneficial is something I don't want to miss. While I am fairly 'regular' as a white, female, middle-class mom, my experiences will lend themselves to advocating for those that don't share the same history as me. I do have some  have experience being a minority, as I am an atheist, and am comfortable dealing with the misconceptions that many people have about it. I believe that a secular perspective can be beneficial in these kind of matters.","During my Bachelor's degree studies I was a member of the Colorado Student Association. I represented Western State University on this board from 2000-2002, and then represented CU-Denver from 2002-2003. Additionally, I was a student trustee to the (now disbanded) State Colleges Board of Trustees in 2001-2002 for Western State University. After transferring colleges, I was a student representative for the Auraria campus Board of Trustees, representing CU-Denver from 2002-2003.

I advocated for the passage of ballot measures 4A & 4B in my neighborhood during the most recent election. I am a firm believer that schools need adequate funding to prepare students for the increasingly competitive world in which we live, and that teachers are generally underpaid and under-appreciated in our society. 
I am comfortable advocating for children with special needs and developmental delays, and often connect people I meet in passing to the appropriate services available to them in their community (i.e. community center boards, Child Find, Special Olympics Young Athletes, and social support groups).
I have also worked with volunteer groups in my community, such as Highlands Ranch Helps, and have organized donation drives to benefit Meghan's Wish Foundation (supporting kids in foster care), Together We Rise, and Aurora Warms the Night.","Democratic National Committee member, 2016-2018

I am passionate about bringing people together in positive ways. My neighbors joke that I am the community welcome-wagon, and I strive to make people feel welcome and connected. 
I am more than comfortable questioning why things are the way they are, evaluating the evidence, and coming to a consensus that is fair. I understand that there are often differences between the letter and the spirit of the law, and am comfortable discussing the reasoning behind both sides. I always want to know where someone else is coming from, especially when we disagree. If I can understand their point of view, it widens my perspective on the world, and I hope that by understanding my point of view others walk away with broader horizons too.

I have also been driven to explore areas in reading books about Colorado history and how important it is to know how history can shape our present and future. Through all these different lenses I have seen many changes both good and bad.  My jobs, personal projects and volunteer efforts have been focused mostly on customer service and have  involved strong listening and analytical skills to produce a workable solution.  I care very much about contributing to a process that will result in a balanced, healthy, and sustainable Colorado for all its inhabitants and environment.","Prior to 2015, I served on  four different non-partisan boards (Eagle Valley Humane Society, Eagle County Crime Stoppers, Vail Recreation District, and Western Pack Burro Association). I was a member and officer for three out of four.  I organized meetings, annual events, fundraisers and volunteers. I also advocated for victims of crime and represented constituents.  As an officer and a board member I was also responsible for an outcome that would take many ideas and opinions into consideration for the benefit of the community.","Virtual Legislative Volunteer for Representative Millie Hamner, May-January, interim sessions 2013-2018

The knowledge I gained from that has influenced my jobs, volunteer work and hobbies since then. My paralegal education helped me to understand legal issues and their applications. Serving on four different Boards of Directors has given me well-rounded experience with a broad range populations and situations.  Being able to consider different points of view and apply to a common goal has been essential for success. All of this has given me skills and experience to adapt and succeed in finding solutions to situations that presented challenges.  The new gymnastics center in Vail is the best example of how I was able to participate as a citizen and then a board member to bring about change and introduce a progressive eight years to Vail’s recreation community.","My work on four non-partisan boards that represent law enforcement, animal welfare, recreation, sports and balancing the needs of the members and their constituents. Through considering a wide range of opinions and balancing the needs and goals of different communities, we were able to achieve one shared goal: partnerships.  Victim Services based out of a law enforcement agency in Eagle County was new and I had to fund my job through a grant at first.  It eventually became a funded position through the Eagle County Sheriff’s Office (ECSO).  I formed partnerships with existing victim advocate groups and worked with other law enforcement agencies to incorporate how each agency could help. The new gymnastics center involved finding land and funding to relocate since the existing space was being used by Eagle River Water & Sanitation District (ERWSD) for a planned expansion.  Discussions involved the Town of Vail, ERWSD, Vail Recreation District (VRD) and Eagle County School District.  New partnerships and funding mechanisms were formed and the facility was built next to Red Sandstone Elementary School in Vail.  This project resulted in the VRD board moving on from this project and learning how to form other new partnerships with Vail Ski & Snowboard Academy and other recreation districts in the valley to share our field spaces for tournaments and training. Since the Vail Valley has limited space for field sports this was essential to keep and grow recreational programs for the entire valley. The new animal shelter was a new partnership with Eagle County Animal Control that was necessary since neither the Eagle County Humane Society or Animal Control could afford to build a shelter without help. These two projects were very successful, and they benefit these communities today.  I have learned through my jobs and volunteer work that different opinions can produce sustainable and productive results.","Millie Hamner, Gail Schwartz, Brittany Peterson, Julie McCluskie, Diane Mitsch Bush, Phil Weiser, Joe Neguse, Dylan Roberts, Mike Johnston, Colorado House Majority Project, John Hickenlooper, Matt Scherr, Pitkin County Democratic Party, Colorado Sierra Club, Colorado Democratic Party, ProgressNow, Protect our Winters, Conservation Colorado, National Parks Conservation Association, Nature Conservancy, American Solar Energy Society, Wilderness Workshop.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/1176,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/legislative/1176.html

Current political polarization requires a thoughtful approach to redistricting to ensure that all Coloradans' voices are heard.","I have served on the boards of trustees of two schools, a community center, and two cultural organizations.  During my board service I have learned to listen to concerns and build consensus among board members with divergent viewpoints.  I would draw upon my training as a lawyer and community volunteer to apply those skills to disagreements among the commissioners.","Since 2015 I have served as President and Board Member of Friends of Chamber Music, and in a volunteer position as Juvenile Justice Investigator for the ACLU of Colorado.  During the 2020 General Election I served as the Election Judge Supervisor at the Blair Caldwell Library Voter Service and Polling Center.","Lawyers are trained to examine information and identify the relevant facts and issues.  I know how to analyze facts to identify what is relevant, how to synthesize arguments, and how to explain my conclusions clearly.","I will promote consensus by looking for areas of agreement among the commissioners and seeking ways to expand those areas.  Where agreement is elusive, demonstrating that one has heard and understood different points of view is an effective method of reaching consensus.  As a lawyer, I understand that the best results come in cases where both my client and the opposing party feel their arguments have been heard and understood.  As a U.S. Peace Corps Volunteer in the 1990's, my job was to encourage environmental reforms in a coal mining region of the Czech Republic.  Finding common ground between environmental NGO's and mining interests required tact, diplomacy, and a sense of shared purpose.

I am specifically interested in serving on the commission, because the issue of redistricting has become so controversial nationally. I feel this community-generated commission is a genuine opportunity to change that narrative and move away from a non-productive, hyper partisan country. I also see great potential for this commission to become best practice nation-wide. I believe that this century will present unimaginable challenges and the current atmosphere in the country is toxic and will debilitate us a nation to respond to these challenges, unless we decrease the partisanship. We need to rebuild trust in community, institutions, and professionalism. I also don’t believe the level of partisanship within this country is inevitable, as I do not think that I have experienced such deep partisanship in other countries that I have lived.

I am also a founding member of an internet group called Ethiopian Architecture and Urbanism. I was in the Chair of Landscape Architecture at the Ethiopian Institute of Architecture, Building Construction, and City Development. There, I wrote the curriculum, launched, and lectured in the first degree for landscape architecture within Ethiopia.","I believe that by having a master’s I have demonstrated a commitment and ability to apply logic and reason to a problem. While I worked at the Ethiopian Institute of Architecture, Building Construction and City Development, I received the highest student feedback of any academic staff of which there were over 200, which testified to my commitment to my position, which was fundamentally about teaching students how to apply logic and reason to their own work. In Melbourne, I worked as a consultant for the City of Melbourne doing community engagement. Through this work, I learned that people are generally rather reasonable with their beliefs and issues. However, it takes listening with an open heart to understand their issues. This experience gave me direct experience with community engagement and consensus building. My background in landscape architecture will be directly relevant to this position. I use GIS and CAD and have made many maps within my professional life at different scales. I have analyzed and generated large watershed-scale areas as well as microclimates on a smaller scale. I have generated maps based on several specific parameters and then generated other maps with different, but similar, parameters and compared them. This experience has given me intimate exposure on how maps can be manipulated and the importance human generated lines can hold. Inherent to a landscape architecture education and the profession is the overlap it has with city planning. Therefore, I think this will also contribute to my ability to understand population dynamics. I have published several academic works, such as a conference paper and two book chapters. Such publications were all written in connection with various universities spanning three continents. In addition, in my personal life I enjoy continued learning.","I have spent nearly the entirety of my adult life living, studying, and working amongst different cultures and people often with opposing beliefs and values. I feel that the most important aspects to understanding and appreciating a culture or person different from you is deep listening and being open to what is being said. Therefore, I would use this same approach when beginning to promote consensus amongst the commissioners. However, as the process proceeds, the position I form will be based upon facts. Therefore, I would not approach this task with the aim of trying to convince others about my beliefs or political views, but rather about the facts and what they indicate. Therefore, responding to the facts would be the basis of my position and would be the means I use to attempt to convince others of my position. In addition, I do not think it will be possible to achieve a ‘perfect’ outcome with complete consensus with everyone. Therefore, compromise will be essential to how I approach challenges and situations and ultimately a fair result. My own family composition attests to an ability to compromise and thrive with difference. My husband is Ethiopian and we have different religious, cultural, ethnic and historic experiences, yet we have been happily married for over five years with a beautiful son. Beyond the belief that fair redistricting will also help to rebuild trust within communities and lessen the toxic partisanship of our nation, I feel that my background in academia and research will help me be fair and impartial.","I am politically active, but not in an official capacity. I have voted in every election since being of age. I donated to several democratic campaigns in the past year, including: Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, and most recently to the Democrats in Georgia to help flip the Senate. Before this year, I do not believe that I have donated to other political campaigns. I often write letters and call political leaders when there is legislation to be decided and I want my voice heard regarding that legislation. I have been doing this for years, including while I lived abroad. Lately, I have been regularly active in campaigning to end the culling of geese and for more transparency in the city of Denver. Through this process, I have become more aware of how the City Council, Denver Parks and Recreation, and the Mayor’s office operate. Together with other advocates, we are working to set up a community science group to watch the lakes and learn more about the geese. While living in Moscow, Russia, I volunteered with an organization that helps forced migrants and refugees, where I taught English on a weekly basis. I later started volunteer translating for the European Court for Human Rights. For this position I would translate legal documents from Russian into English that would be presented to the Court.

Before moving to Colorado I was Director of a research center in Mali. My managerial background also includes being Director of the Master in Biology program at CSU Pueblo for seven years. The outside collaboration with research scientists at other institutions in US helped me approach teaching and critical thinking from a broader perspective. I chaired and/or served on several committees at CSU Pueblo, including faculty senate committees and the University Board on Diversity and Equality.

While department chair and chair of various committees at Colorado State University Pueblo, I have skillfully worked with students, staff and faculty to solve complicated problems. As redistricting commissioners, it is essential that we address the following when we establish working ground rules: What is our primary function as apportioning congressional commission, a process that will impact Colorado for the next 10 years? What are the legal requirements? What are the strengths and weaknesses of current congressional maps? How do we plan to address the issues identified in order to achieve adequate representation of all the different stakeholders in our society, in a mutually respectful environment? How do we listen to one another first with an open mind before formulating our stands? How do we reasonably agree to disagree? What do we agree or disagree with, and why or why not? How do we overcome our biases (because these exist) and navigate this contentions territory? How do we productively capitalize on the expertise of staff and on data made available to the commission? How do we carefully read and analyze pertinent information, including 2020 Census data and computer modeling to reach conclusions based on data and evidence? How do we assign specific tasks to individual commissioners? How do we reach a practical compromise? Most importantly, how does the commission effectively solicit and receive public input in order for voters to actively participate in the process and help develop fair maps that are not skewed to favor a particular party or interest group, and that are best for Colorado as a whole?","Voters will not trust the redistricting commission’s work unless there is fairness and impartiality, regardless of the personal differences and various perspectives of the commissioners. As a Certified Mediator who was University Grievance Officer for five years, I understand the importance of practical compromise in consensus decision making. As Research Center Director, Chair of the Biology Department at Colorado State University Pueblo (largest department on campus), and chair of various University committees, including the University Board on Diversity and Equality, I have always listened to others first and tried to understand them, before making my point. The commissioner needs to effectively examine the situation from all angles and from all people’s perspectives, even when issues become contentious, in order to reach agreement.

Among other things, this means that district lines are not written in such a way to ensure a particular outcome, but rather that citizens in each district are given real choice with candidates that attend to the needs and interests of the population.  Second, I am a strong believer in shared community responsibility.  While it is easy to criticize the decisions of others, we often forget how difficult it is to shoulder the decisions.  I offer my time and effort to share that responsibility.","I have concentrated my efforts on addressing environmental issues and community support.

Not all social phenomena are measurable or accepted as valid, and thus I am also very much attuned to how ideas are communicated, sometimes very intentionally designed to divide.  I have also paid attention to the details of redistricting (legal rules, political manuevering, technology aids in achieving politically-favored results, etc.).  While I cannot claim expertise in mapping, I am an analytical thinker and balanced thinker who can spot bias.","Being even-handed and building consensus are critical practices in my teaching and community service.  I seek to identify needs and shared interests in building towards agreement -- moving away from hard positions to language that fosters a commitment to supporting our common ground.  I have long used the negotiation principles and practices developed in the book ""Getting to Yes.""  
In terms of my ability to be fair or impartial, these are practices critical in any effective community activity or in the teaching environment, and most particularly in the contemporary political science class. I communicate to students at the outset that we should expect disagreement and this is partly due to our different sets of life experiences.  Furthermore, none of us has a lock on ""the truth,"" and instead it is the collective set of perspectives that will help us to identify our common reality and get us closer to ""the truth.""  This is akin to the traditional Indian parable, ""the blind men and the elephant.""  With this at the foundation, I am committed to not only giving fair and equal voice to competing perspectives, but also asking individuals to ""step into the shoes of the other"" as we consider why we might disagree.  I favor coming to the middle rather than than win-lose outcomes.","As an academic focused on American politics, I am an avid observer of politics, including of redistricting politics.  I regularly teach undergraduates on issues of American politics, including on the US Congress, and oversee students engaged in political and campaign-related internships (for all political parties and a wide range of candidates at local, state and national levels).

An independent team to perform redistricting is a great step in the right direction for true representation of the people of Colorado. I would be honored to work with a team of people to achieve that goal in a bipartisan manner!,"Our HOA covenants was set up unfairly such that more than 1/2 of the community was paying more for HOA fees than others and the disparity was growing every time HOA fees were raised because of a covenant rule that stated a portion of the neighborhood was required to pay 1.5 times more than the other portion. The fees are used for maintenance of amenities in the community to which all households have equal access.  I lead the committee to research (with the help of a couple of board members) how we could change the covenants and educate the community on how the fees were used for amenities shared across the community. We learned that we would have to have an election to add an amendment to remove the 1.5 times rule. 

I sent out polls for the community to vote on preferred methods of equalizing the fees. Although this seemed like an insurmountable task, the poll indicated that 18 or 19 of the homeowners who were paying less would vote for the change to the covenants and increase their fees.  This was an indication that the task was not insurmountable and we proceeded with community meetings and presentations which I put together. Two board members and I presented the information.  An election was held and the committee and I canvassed the neighborhood to make sure everyone was aware of the amendment and voted.  All of the 153 households that were currently paying more needed to vote to pass the amendment since the margin was going to be so slim. This was a harder task than it would seem, since some of these homes were rented and/or the owners were hard to reach, or they were in the process of moving.  In addition, 20 households that were paying less were needed to vote for the amendment and increase their fees. 22 (2 more than the 20 needed) neighbors voted for the amendment and raising their fees, while 100% of the homes who had been paying more voted in approval of equalizing fees.

With my HOA committee team and a couple of board members were were able to resolve a contentious issue that had existed since our community's inception (around 12 years).  Nobody thought we’d be successful but we were! This involved some neighbors voting to pay more in fees until theirs were equal to what other neighbors had been paying (as detailed above in the volunteer experience section above).","It comes down to keeping the goals and requirements impartially in mind, communicating them, listening, and compromising where possible.

As a poll watcher, I impartially looked for inconsistencies and areas of weakness in the election system.  I worked well in a bipartisan team during the Risk Limiting Audit (RLA) of the primary election.  I was a team lead and applications architect for developing software.  In my software career, I worked successfully with intelligent co-workers to resolve and compromise on design issues.  
I and the rest of the HOA team was able to convince people that were paying less in HOA fees to see that it wasn't right that some people were paying more for the same amenities. I was also able to communicate effectively with people that were upset over changing HOA fee covenant rules by listening, discussion, and outreach via presenting researched information, and holding Q&A sessions.  One of the more valuable skills of being a health coach is listening and supporting a client in their goals.  It often comes back to establishing clear goals and providing support to reach them.","I was a poll watcher for the 2020 Jeffco primary elections and donated to Dan Rosier, Joni for Jeffco, Trump, Cory Gardner and other conservative candidates.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/616,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/legislative/616.html

I believe that the legislative redistricting commission has an amazing opportunity to ensure that Colorado's legislative districts serve as an honest reflection of those who live in them, without the partisan gerrymandering we've seen over so many years. I would be extremely honored to be entrusted with a role on the legislative re-districting Commission and believe its work will have a lasting impact on the State - for the better.","I think the only the only applicable experience I have to this question is my experience with CASTA - the Colorado Association of Transit Agencies. As president of the Board of Directors of CASTA, I helped represent and advocate for literally every transit agency in the State. As a Board member, I have worked hard to ensure that the voice of every member agency of CASTA was represented in Board discussions and outside lobbying efforts. Its not always easy to maintain a balanced viewpoint that represented interests from all across the State but I think we do a pretty good job at CASTA. I think the fact that I have been elected to the CASTA Board for two terms now illustrates that my peers and colleagues from around the state (those who elect members of the Board) trust my intent, judgement, and ability to lead.","- no political organizations or party affiliation since 2007.

As an executive leader with a proven track record working in the public sector with and on behalf of varied communities, I am always striving for consensus and agreement in difficult conversations. This can only be done by being fair and impartial - even in difficult or stressful conversations. I have found (for better or worse - and not always to my pleasure) that I am a natural leader when it comes to pulling groups together to develop mutually beneficial solutions. This has been confirmed by some work over the years with professional coaches and assessments such as Hogan Lead and Hogan Challenge - I'd be happy to share the results of those assessments if anyone wanted to see them. How do I do it? I'm just myself - no bull. I'm also a pretty nice guy who people respect and want to work with - even if they need to give a little.

If not me, who?’ moments.  I mean that, really.

I earned two political science degrees and taught American Government to future military officers.  That officer corps has a well-earned reputation for being the most trusted, least partisan group in our nation.  That’s how I taught as well; non-partisan.  The students still didn't know my political views at the end of the semester.  That open minded approach attracted me to Y & Z.  It’s also why I’ve been a member of both major political parties at various times in the distant past but have been unaffiliated for many years.

This commission’s goal of ending gerrymandering in Colorado is critical to our democracy and will be a model for our republic.  That’s well worth doing; it’s well worth a citizen’s time and effort.","Volunteer in the effort to pass Y & Z.

I also taught data analysis and forecasting to professional analysts in my small business.  And I have three US patents with a few more unsuccessful applications.  Patents require initiative and insight as well as analysis.

Building on that experience, my business partner and I created a method to measure group cultures empirically and despite the resistance, fear, delusion, etc. that often invalidates surveys.  That’s a current and concrete example of applying data analysis to human issues.

All of that means I see patterns in data and impartially follow them to their logical conclusion.","I have an acute sense of fairness.  I support the underdog and resist bullies.  At the most basic level, that’s why Americans with much talent and many options choose to serve our nation in various military and civilian capacities rather than follow easier, more lucrative paths.

I’ve also been a partner in a small data analysis firm, following facts where they led.  That background is certainly relevant to demographics, census data, affiliations such as minority groups, etc.

I believe such experience and qualities will be common among the commissioners and so will contribute to consensus, or at least agreement, that meets the commission’s charter and Coloradans’ intent.","I volunteered on two presidential campaigns and two congressional campaigns, all in Colorado and for both Democrat and Republican candidates.

I have previously worked in the ICU at the Denver VA Medical Center, as a hospice case manager, and in a sexual health clinic. I am currently enrolled in my masters degree in nursing with a focus in healthcare policy through Chamberlain University.","Over the past two years, I have been re-evaluating my professional career and thinking about how I want to best utilize my skills as a nurse. I have become very interested in the political process and the intersection of how healthcare and policy can ensure more people have access to high quality healthcare. I am currently working on my masters in nursing with a focus on healthcare policy and want to work at a state or federal level to advise, research and craft policy that makes our healthcare system more efficient, effective, accessible, affordable and equitable. Serving on the commission would be a perfect introduction into learning how individuals and communities engage with government and the civic process, and would allow me to use my voice to advocate for those who are unable to advocate for themselves.","As a nurse whose career has spanned age, race, economic, religious and sexual identity demographics, I have become passionate about using my voice to advocate for those whose voices are often overlooked. Since 2015, I have volunteered with Hope House Colorado, a nonprofit organization that provides educational and financial assistance to teenage mothers that come from generational poverty. In the past five years, I have created several educational opportunities to allow the teens to learn more about their bodies and safe sexual practices, while also occasionally being a professional mentor to young women who have expressed interest in pursuing careers in the healthcare field. I am additionally involved with Cobalt, which raises awareness and supports policies at a state and federal level that protect women's access to reproductive healthcare.","I volunteer with Hope House Colorado as the volunteer nurse educator. I have also previously been involved with National Nurses United, a nursing union that I was a member of when I worked at the Denver VA Medical Center.","Many times throughout my career, I have had to draw on logic and reason to solve a problem. Frequently in my time as an ICU nurse, I would need to utilize critical thinking and applied logic to determine why my patient was declining quickly, which involved referencing their medical chart, looking over previous lab values and anticipating what the provider might order to help resolve the patient's problems. In my current role managing calls from employees regarding COVID, I must use algorithms and policies to determine who needs to be tested for COVID and who is safe to return to work without potentially infecting other employees. I utilize logic and reason every day in my job as a nurse and as a masters student, and will bring that same level of commitment to the commission as well.","As a nurse, it is my responsibility to take medically complex information given by providers to give patients and their families the necessary information to make the best decisions for their care. Additionally, I take the expressed wishes of patient and their families about their goals of care and advocate for their needs to their medical team. A significant component of my job is creating consensus among many groups of people with often very differing views. As nursing is the intersection of science and caring, I am able to use both appeals to emotion and appeals to reason to bring people together towards a common goal. Nursing requires fairness and impartiality, as my job is to care for my patients and advocate for their expressed goals rather than applying my thoughts, feelings or opinions to their care. I will use all of the skills and knowledge I have generated as a nurse to promote consensus, agreement, fairness and impartiality on the commission.","I have only recently become involved with politics and civic engagement.

More broadly, I'm also an expert in epidemiology, research study design, and technical writing.","I believe districting must be scientifically based so that votes from citizens best represent the will of the people. Modern statistical and GIS should be employed so that demography and geography are leveraged for the representation of the people. Independence of the commission is of utmost value, so that partisan influence is minimized. Colorado's split demographic among Republicans, Democrats, and Unaffiliated is an ideal design for the commission.  I wish to represent the unaffiliated voter, since my political outlook is one that a centrist attitude, not skewed toward one party or another.

Prior to this, I was a member of the American Chemical Society for 8 years.  I am not a part of any political organization.","As a PhD scientist, on a daily basis, I employ complex statistical analytics to solve scientific problems (as demonstrated in my published scientific work). Before a solution is discovered, we must correctly frame a problem and the goals of any analysis. Without the correct scientific question, any analysis is useless.  Once a problem is correctly framed, then a solution can be sought. I build defensible bodies of evidence to support public health initiatives in my professional work. In this commission, I would employ the same skills to the redistricting task. The redistricting problem must be correctly framed, the tools to solve the problem characterized, and the solution well defended logically.","In my professional work, I regularly communicate complex scientific ideas to non-scientists in government and industry. We learn skills that help those not familiar with science to understand the science. I think this experience will be helpful in this commission. As commissioners, we must find consensus on the best districts to represent the citizens of Colorado. I would need to bridge understanding between commissioners and between the commission and the public.

I work for a nonprofit safety net hospital. We provide statistical analyses to the pharmaceutical industry and to federal government regulators, where our independence is crucial to our success. Our role is intentionally and specifically impartial so that we might provide the best analysis for government to develop policy, not favoring either side in an evaluation of drug safety. We must be impartial so that medicines are proven to be safe and effective for the benefit of the populace.

First, I strongly support the mission of this commission. I know from personal experience that competitive districts benefit our communities. I seek to help the commission fulfill its mission.

Second, I am uniquely qualified to serve on this commission. All of my experiences seem to be pointing to this particular opportunity. In other contexts, I have put into practice the skills and abilities called for—organizing, representing, advocating for, and considering interests. I have a proven track record of fairly and impartially creating agreement and promoting consensus. My experiences campaigning and as a candidate have provided me with analytical skills that are particularly relevant for this effort.

Third, I desire to leave a legacy. If this commission does its job well, its impact will be no less than 10 years, the period until the next census. I believe, though, that the commission’s legacy could be much longer. The precedents set and procedures put into place are likely (with tweaks) to be used by future commissions. The echoes may be generational. In addition, Colorado is a leader in the nation in the use of citizen-based independent redistricting commissions. We may be able to show the rest of the country how to be successful in putting an end to partisan gerrymandering. I want to be a part of this legacy. 

I am applying for both the Legislative and Congressional Redistricting Commissions. My preference is to serve on the Legislative Redistricting Commission. However, I would consider it a privilege and honor to serve on either commission.","Two experiences illustrate particularly well my abilities in organizing, representing, advocating for, and considering interests. The first is when I lead the Poudre Schools District Accountability Committee review of the first charter school application in Fort Collins. The second is successfully leading my homeowners’ association in changing the neighborhood covenants.

As an unpaid volunteer, I was an active participant in the Poudre Schools District Accountability Committee when the first charter school application was submitted. At the time, charter schools were a political hot potato. Following state law, it fell to the District Accountability Committee to review the application and consider the interests of the applicant, the school district, and the community as a whole. I volunteered to head the review subcommittee and organized four other subcommittee members. Under my leadership, the subcommittee created a fair and impartial process by first identifying 28 application requirements specified by state law and the school district. The subcommittee then painstakingly reviewed the application against these standards and evaluated whether required information was provided, whether it was sufficiently detailed, and whether the applicant's proposal for each requirement was acceptable. Finally, I represented the subcommittee by presenting to the entire District Accountability Committee and to the school board our findings regarding the merits and deficiencies of the application.

The subcommittee did a masterful job and, as a result, everybody was angered. The pro-charter people were upset because we did not unquestionably accept the application. The anti-charter people were upset that we did not flatly deny the application. These reactions are evidence of our impartiality. 

And the subcommittee? We had more than consensus. We were unanimous in our findings. By focusing on the standards set by law and first developing a fair and impartial process for review of the application against the standards, the subcommittee was able to stay above the political fray.

In the end, the applicant was able to address deficiencies in the application and the charter school was approved. Since then other charter schools have come and gone in Fort Collins but this school remains strong and successful. I truly believe our subcommittee deserves some credit for that. I am proud of my efforts in organizing the subcommittee, representing the subcommittee before the school board, advocating for the subcommittee’s recommendations, and considering the interests of the various stakeholder groups.

I envision a similar process for the redistricting commission. This effort has the potential to be politically destabilizing for some entrenched interests. After all, if the commission does its job well, some currently uncompetitive districts will made competitive... and some people are not going to like that. I believe if redistricting commission focuses on the standards set by law and develops and follows a fair and impartial process around those standards, it will be successful in achieving its mission.

More recently, as an active participant in my homeowners’ association, I served on the Board of Directors when it sought to make a covenant change. Want to take on a challenge? Volunteer for your HOA!

As President for much of this process, I organized most aspects of this effort. I sought to ensure that Board members were thoroughly informed of all available options. With impartially, I insisted that the Board patiently allow anyone to speak and that everyone be heard. In this way the Board was able to consider the interests of all our neighbors. I also stepped aside when others wanted to take a more active leadership role (and then stepped back into leadership when they decided leading really was not that much fun). In this way I was able promote consensus by building trust and creating buy-in.

In the end, the Board reached unanimous agreement on a proposal to present to our homeowners. We were able to achieve consensus among our homeowners with 150 of 175 voting households in favor of the proposal. These numbers are truly amazing--a very high level of neighborhood engagement with 86% of households in agreement!

Per state law, our final step was to obtain court approval of the changes. I represented my HOA in court and advocated on behalf of my neighbors.

Our efforts were successful. Following approval by the court, the covenant changes went into effect. They had an immediate impact on our HOA, greatly strengthening its financial situation. This summer costly repairs were made to the asphalt path through our neighborhood common area. The funds for these repairs were made available because of the changes to our covenants. I am deeply satisfied to see the legacy of my efforts and the positive impact of effectively organizing this project, representing and considering the interests of my neighbors and our neighborhood, and advocating for them.

These experiences give me confidence that I will serve well if selected to serve on this commission.","Since November 10, 2015, I have been a member of and actively participated in: Toastmasters, Timberline Church, Four Seasons Master Homeowners Association, North Fort Collins Business Association, Fort Collins Board of REALTORS, Colorado Association of REALTORS, National Association of REALTORS, and Council of Residential Specialists. My uninterrupted participation in all these organizations began prior to 2015.

In 2015 I was recognized as the Fort Collins Board of REALTOR Housing Hero for my affordable housing advocacy.","My two engineering degrees certainly speak to my analytical skills. More importantly, I have relevant analytical skills developed by working on campaigns and being a candidate. I am experienced digging into voter and demographic data to determine precinct and district composition and to assess likely electorate behavior. 

I am a people-oriented analyst. This means that I have the soft skills to work effectively with others while possessing strong logic and reasoning skills.

I have great confidence in my ability to serve well on a redistricting commission. It is my sincere hope that I will have the opportunity to do so.

Respectfully submitted,
Eric Kronwall","In my discussion of my experience in organizing, representing, advocating for, or considering the interests of groups, organizations, or associations in Colorado, I recount two challenging situations where I promoted consensus, created agreement, and was fair and impartial. Please carefully review that portion of my application.

I am a process person. How we get to an outcome is often just as important as the outcome itself. I have found it is much easier to get to agreement and consensus when processes and procedures are hashed out beforehand. If selected to serve, I will urge my fellow commissioners to first develop processes and procedures for how business and hearings are conducted and how proposed district maps are evaluated relative to legal requirements and competitiveness. 

Building trusting on a one-on-one basis with the other commissioners facilitates agreement and consensus. I have done this in the past by:
> Making and keeping promises,
> Transparency,
> Bending over backwards to elicit and listen to the input of others, and
> Assumption of positive intent.

In addition to creating agreement and promoting consensus, good processes help to assure fairness and impartiality.","For at least the past 15 years I have actively participated as a volunteer for numerous political campaigns, supporting candidates for Fort Collins and Loveland City Council, State House of Representatives, State Senate, and Larimer County offices. In 2011 on my own initiative, I developed a campaign training course for candidates and campaign managers. My current campaign participation is most often as an unpaid strategy and messaging consultant.

My most significant political activity was running for Fort Collins City Council in 2015. This non-partisan race was very competitive. In a district with about 14,000 registered voters, I lost by 140 votes. While I did not care for this outcome, I know in my heart of hearts that the citizens of Fort Collins benefited from a competitive race.

I have first-hand experience and a perspective shared by few others--that of a candidate--about what makes a race competitive and the benefits enjoyed by our communities from competitive races. This fuels my motivation to serve and partly explains my strong support for the mission of the redistricting commission. My experience and perspective uniquely qualify me to serve, having provided me with relevant analytical skills.

I've used these skills in getting bipartisan legislation passed in Congress and in state legislatures in the past.

The goal is to get a balanced outcome which all parties can live with and nobody feels like they were run over in the process.","I have always been someone who tries to evaluate plans, ideas or proposals based on how they match up to my guiding principles.

I worked with the County Departments of Human/Social  on providing education, receiving feedback and coming to consensus with program directors of the Medicaid and Human Services programs I worked, developed and administered.  It is important to remember that one size does not fit all of the state.  Colorado is very diverse and has different needs in each county.  I was able to work collaboratively with the Counties, service providers and clients to implement long-term care services in each county.  In the late 80's and early 90's when the Single Entry Points were being developed I was working with the different County Commissioners and County Directors to help divide the state into 23 different long-term service providers and case managers.  This was a difficult task as each County wanted to be the center, and some counties didn't want to partner and work with their neighboring counties.  In addition, when Medicaid started to serve clients through the HMOs I worked with various HMOs, state legislators, physician groups, and hospitals to make sure all services were provided to clients in all areas of the state.  Then when I served on the Colorado Commission on Aging representing CD3, which is a very large and diverse district, I needed to be sure that all the cities, counties, rural and urban areas were represented and needed to work with the other Commissioners who represented their CD.

legislative,2003,2020-11-07T19:11:10Z,Karen Larsen Tonso,,Democrat,woman,f,Caucasian,False,80005,retired,"BS Geologic Engineering, MA Secondary Mathematics, PhD Foundations of Education. Colorado Teaching Certificate: Secondary Mathematics. Undergraduate and graduate coursework in Philosophy, Graduate work in Applied Mathematics.","My reasons for applying to serve on the Redistricting Commission revolved around my desire to make political life in our society more just for all Coloradans. Though I am today well-educated and economically comfortable, I grew up in agrarian circumstances where I expected to be neither. As is the case for many from less fortunate childhoods, especially those plagued with violence at home, finding a better life and making life better for others cannot be disentangled. I grew up in rural circumstances in Oklahoma and Texas never expecting to attend higher education, then accepted an opportunity to study engineering Colorado. Education served as my steppingstone to a better life. I was very fortunate to arrive at Colorado School of Mines understanding the virtues of hard work and persistence. I am, thus, especially well-trained in mathematics and the sciences, and was the 21st woman graduate of Mines, with a degree in Geologic Engineering, providing unique experiences about being a member of an under-represented group. Though women were seldom hired for engineering jobs at the time, the Arab oil embargo made any engineer who could work in the petroleum industry desirous, even women. I worked in petroleum engineering (monitoring oil reservoirs and production) for 15 years: in a field office in very rural NM, in a research center in Littleton, CO, and at a regional bank in an energy lending group. In each, I was the sole woman engineer and know the isolation of being under-represented. Along the way, I completed graduate coursework in Applied Mathematics. 

I left engineering and retrained in education to address my life-long goal of making life better for others. I studied philosophy for a year to think about my goals. Since education had provided my opportunities, I decided to give back in this area. But since my worldview was narrow and specific to my circumstances, I needed to better understand the views of others unlike myself, as well as come to deeper understandings about life in a democracy and how education served democracy’s aims. I became a certified teacher of secondary mathematics in CO and earned a master’s in Math Education, then entered a doctoral program in foundations of education (the area where I could learn about education in a democracy). My goal was to become a professor and to teach on a campus educating under-served graduate students. I earned my PhD in Boulder and after a short time on the itinerant-faculty circuit landed my dream job in Detroit at Wayne State University, a Research-1 University serving Black, recent immigrant, and lower-income students. Thus, I spent the last 15 years of my work life serving these students, in particular guiding 26 of them through the doctorate and into leadership positions in their communities. Preparing new leaders is central to the aims of social justice in a democracy, which in the US has focused on equity in education, economic well-being through employment, and enfranchisement. Redistricting is part and parcel of how political structures enact long-standing ideals of our democracy, and I possess skills relevant to the Commission.

My two areas of academic expertise, research methods and social justice in education, contribute to my qualifications for the commission. My mathematical skills, background in geologic engineering, and abilities to manage both quantitative and qualitative information relate directly to the need of the Commission to understand complex data sets and their impacts on diverse people arrayed across Colorado. My expertise in social justice, my academic preparation coupled with my experiences living and working in both urban, suburban, and rural locales with socioeconomic-, racial-, ethnic-, and language-diverse people, provide me with unusual vantage points on the histories of injustice and misrepresentation in the US. These experiences also help me understand the need for justice through fair elections, and help me see not just my own needs, interests, and desires, but also seek to understand and to advocate for the needs, interests, and desires of those least likely to be included in making decisions that impact their lives. Granted I can never directly experience the discrimination felt by many in our society, but I have tried to become more knowledgeable about their circumstances. 

Fair election maps provide an avenue for ensuring that each person is included in political decision-making that influences their lives, the lives of those they care about and of those whose experiences they share. Election maps, when fair, encode our society’s promise that democracy be founded on mutual respect for one another, and on a commitment to participation that springs from thoughtful consideration of important issues impacting everyday lives. My engineering studies and career were underpinned by maps in every setting; in fact, geologic maps represent complex data displayed geographically. 

Thus, serving on the redistricting commission represents an additional way I might contribute to improving the lives of others. I seldom seek out “committee” work in my retirement, but agree to such service when my expertise is well matched to committee/commission goals. As my CV demonstrates, I have a long track record of committee work in my profession(s). In engineering work, teams of differently qualified experts and inter-corporate committees served as the primary way to share technical information and reach consensus on decisions where there were competing interests. At universities, faculty committees guide the institution. In fact, at WSU, shared decision-making was an integral part of the faculty union contract with the Administration, and faculty members took these responsibilities seriously. In addition, I served for over 12 years on the University’s Institutional Review Board. This Board protected diverse research participants’ rights (as I explain further in a subsequent section of this application).

In my community, I am active in a community chorale, a large church, and regularly contribute to food banks and serving homeless meals. I also participate in homeless services in urban settings. These activities provide insights into the wider communities where I have lived.

Thus, I am highly qualified for the task at hand, with my background in mathematics, geology (which in large part is a deeper dive into maps representing complex data displayed geographically), and in social justice scholarship, as well as by my persistent engagement in my profession with others who come from diverse circumstances. Throughout my career, I have worked primarily in settings where group (teamwork) decision-making was the norm. For myself, I have lived experiences with being poor, being hungry, and being the only person like myself in teamwork, offices, and large corporate settings.","I volunteer in online communities to help (women primarily) connect with like-minded individuals working for social justice: to engage in advocating for the rights of homeless, hungry, LGBTQI+, low-income communities’ access to clean air and water, and racial and ethnic communities under-served in especially educational settings. 

In my religious denomination, I advocate for the full inclusion of LGBTQI+ persons, and over the last 5 years have sewn over 500 rainbow stoles for church members to wear as a symbol of full inclusion.","I am active in my county party as a volunteer and in Arvadans for Progressive Action (a nonpartisan) community group devoted to social justice. In addition, I am a member of the Arvada Chorale, have sung with both the Spirituals Project (a group dedicated to preserving and teaching about Negro Spirituals) and the Denver Gay Men’s Chorus, and am a member of the Chancel Choir at my church. I attend Lukas Elementary School PTA meetings (where a grand-daughter attends) and volunteer at a community Arts Camp as a costume designer and seamstress. I was appointed to serve on the Jeffco Schools: School Safety Task Force. 

Most of my other community volunteer work is done outside of “organizations.” I am a sustaining contributor to The NOAH Project (homeless services in Detroit MI), to The Table (Arvada community food bank), and participate in meal service at The Rising and The Delores Project  (homeless food services). In addition, I sew about 250 fleece hats for the homeless annually, produce fleece blankets for homeless and lower-income families and, during the early days of the pandemic, I was able to sew (and donate) about 900 quilter’s-cotton masks for food banks, women’s shelters, and homeless food services, and for essential workers.","In both my engineering, academic career, and home life; logic, analytic skills and problem-solving have been central to my practices. Clearly, engineering and academic work overwhelmingly depend on mathematical science underpinned by logical decisions. I have for the last 50 years worked with maps and with large data sets of both quantitative and qualitative information, upon which decisions rested. As an engineer, I worked in 3 diverse settings, all of which depended on understanding how numbers represent the world around us, and how decisions I was in volved in making impact the lives of others. In the last of these I was the Senior Reservoir Engineer in a large state bank’s energy lending group, and the only engineer employed in the holding company. Here, I worked with technical and financial data to ascertain to what extent given oil production revenue streams might support loans. In fact, I held this position on Black Sunday, May 2, 1982, the day Exxon walked away from their holdings in the Piceance Basin, devastating Colorado’s Western Slope. My role at the bank required my participation in top-level meetings to ensure the bank not only met all guidelines for lending and asset management, but also supported long-time customers whose economic circumstances had changed overnight. I have also served on university-wide and college budget committees responsible for monitoring and advising administrations about budgetary matters during the recession of 2007, which was especially deep in Michigan. As happened in Colorado, significant changes in University and College operations followed, with reductions in faculty lines, shifts in enrollment, and changes in degrees and certificates offered.

In both careers, creative analysis proved central to workplace activities. All engineering decisions depend on strategic planning, optimizing production, collaboration between engineering and field staff, and creative brainstorming to find workable solutions to difficult problems. This is no less true of a faculty member’s responsibilities on a campus where the faculty are central to decisions about a College and University’s future given exigent circumstances. In both engineering and academia, industry downturns and state reductions in campus revenues created circumstances requiring mid-course corrections and restructuring, which were accomplished in academia through my budget committee service. 

Critical thinking skills are required for success in both engineering and academia. For instance, energy loans require persistent auditing to ensure they remain on track, and I was solely responsible for this aspect of a relatively large loan portfolio. I was also responsive to shifting circumstances, such as fluctuating oil prices, and monitored every loan based on its own production stream, but incorporating new information affecting all loans. To make a case attesting to each loan’s status required persistent development of case study information and data interpretation.","Collaborative decision-making, and consensus building, has been central to my committee work, and used both empathy and mutual respect for others. As to empathy, in engineering I was considered a “bleeding heart,” someone who incorporated empathy into routine engineering and corporate decisions. But an example from everyday life exemplifies how empathy is a core part of my character. One dark night as I drove home to Lakewood from late classes in Boulder, I encountered a car north of Golden with its flashers on. Of course, being from the country, I stopped to render aid. A first-language Spanish-speaking family was trying to reach the Jeffco jail where a family member was being released. I gave one of the adults a ride into Golden to connect with this family member. At the jail, the family member was repeatedly rebuffed by the clerical person on duty, who said,  “What? I can’t understand you. Can’t you speak English?” The family member was speaking English and I understood her. With the family member’s permission, I stepped in, introduced myself, and repeated what they had been saying. Only then did the clerical staff act as if they understood and the jailed person was released. I was very embarrassed for Jeffco, and ashamed of my community for being so callous. It was empathy that required me to stop and empathy that led to my providing a ride into Golden. But my shame and embarrassment came from my seeming to be (albeit unwittingly) a participant in this sort of callous treatment of members of marginalized communities in our society. This experience deepened my empathy for those who suffer persistent slights and insults in our society.

As to mutual respect of others, I held a wide range of leadership positions where I treated others with respect despite differing opinions. Engineering ethics requires that engineers recognize the limits of their own expertise and respect the expertise of others, and the same holds among the professoriate. Engineers work hard to get things right, which requires gathering information of both a technical and social nature. That is, like the commission's work, engineering problem-solving routinely situates technical issues within a real-world of people with diverse interests. Engineering work routinely influences the lives of others and engineers cannot pretend otherwise, requiring that these contextualizing situations be understood from the perspective of everyday folks impacted by decisions. In addition, as a professor, I served for over 12 years on one Committee of the University’s Institutional Review Board. Committees included faculty and community members, who guaranteed that every research proposal respected the rights to informed consent of every research participant. Faculty members of the committee spanned the University Schools and Colleges, and each faculty member served because they represented one sort of academic expertise. Research participants came from Detroit MI, a very diverse urban center in the US, as well as from third-world countries around the globe. Members of this committee were trained in, and guided by, community (cultural) expectations for lower-income residents, for Black Americans, for Middle Eastern Americans from diverse national heritages, for diverse indigenous communities, for diverse sub-communities within the LGBTQI+ community, and for recent and long-term immigrants from Central and South American, Middle Eastern, Eastern European (Balkan), and south and eastern Asian countries. I thus have deep training about diverse persons, their cultural practices, and the protection of their rights. Impartiality in both engineering and academic collaborative decision-making came from requiring that stakeholders be included, that their concerns be addressed, and their advice be followed, and fairness emerged through operational structures that encouraged, instead of blunted, participation. 

Taken together my childhood roots in settings quite unlike my adult situation, my educational preparation, and my work and life experiences as an adult provide me with especially well-informed vantage points on life in the US.","My political activity has been in service to campaigns and issues that revolved around improving social justice. I have volunteered for local, regional, and state-wide campaigns where candidates’ goals and integrity matched my expectations.

AB Economics and Applied Mathematics, University of California at Berkeley","I am 10-year resident of Colorado, and my experience living and voting in our great state has only been during this recent decade of change.  The Colorado of 2020 is not the same as the Colorado of 2010 (or 1910); and El Paso County is not the same either.  As a redistricting commission, we are going to need to be equipped to use today’s data to inform choices around district boundaries which fairly represent the all the people of Colorado.  As one example, Colorado’s population of school-aged children has grown by 230,000 between 2010 and 2019.  This is likely to be the fastest growing segment of Colorado residents as the 2020 Census reporting becomes available.  As mother of school-aged children, I want to be sure the commission members analyze fairly the data put before them before drawing districts which have implications for both our current and next generations of voters and elected representatives.","I have worked for 20+ years as a strategy consultant, advising private-sector businesses on how products and services can better meet their customers’ needs.  Across hundreds of professional engagements with business leaders, I have been asked to understand consumer populations, interpret multiple sources of qualitative and quantitative data, and clearly communicate recommendations.  As my resume highlights, I am trained statistician and social scientist.  I have also had roles in managing a statistical software start-up and as a college-level economics lecturer.","Multiple years as a PTO Board Member, School Accountability Committee, and Parent Sounding Board Representative for an Academy District 20 Elementary School; El Paso County Democratic Party member.","I organize, aggregate, and summarize multiple sources of information so that decisions makers can take action.  I have 30 years of experience with quantitative data analysis and statistical software packages, including performing analysis on US Census data files. I have taught quantitative analysis methods to 100s of business professionals.","I form my perspective based upon data.  I also believe that listening to others and discussing differences are critical skills to building consensus.  Part of my professional work is facilitating focus groups and small group discussions where I am asked to inquire actively, listen whole-heartly, understand empathetically, and manage time well.  Working in the consumer behavior field requires me to establish rapport quickly across people of different ages, genders, ethnicities, and life experiences around the world.  I believe these skills will serve me well in interacting with a diverse set of fellow commission members on a common set of objectives for the people of Colorado.","This is my first year of any notable political activity, and I have never run for or held any elected office.  In 2020, I served as a precinct organizer for the El Paso County Democratic party.  For the November 2020 General Election, I volunteered as a poll watcher for the Colorado Democrats, and I was hired as temporary Election Judge by El Paso County.  During the summer and fall of 2020, I have volunteered my time campaigning for several women candidates in federal and state-level offices.  Year to date for 2020, I have contributed about $375 in total across the following groups/candidates:  El Paso County Democratic Party, Meg Fossinger, Jillian Freeland, and Diane Mitsch Bush.

I have been in the business of victim advocacy for 17 years and have been working in cultural community-based nonprofits since 1990; whether I lived in urban Denver, or rural Nebraska, or in the growing and progressing Colorado Springs. You will see in my resume that I have served community in local, statewide, and national positions as a technical assistance provider for victim service nonprofits in a variety of settings.","I have earned a GED from the Emily Griffith School of opportunity in 1989 when I left South High School in Denver’s Washington Park neighborhood which is the same school from which my parents graduated and where they met. I attended the Community College of Denver until I became pregnant and left school to raise my children and take care of my family. As an adult, I attended the Women’s College at the University of Denver but have not completed the degree requirements
Over the past 20 years I have built a solid career as a victim advocate, a technical assistance provider, a researcher, and a trainer. I am considered a subject matter expert on the topic of anti-domestic violence and anti-sexual assault.  I have recently become an unlicensed psychotherapist in the state of Colorado and am attending a yearlong certification course for MindBody Therapy. While I continue to hold out for finishing my university degree one day, over the course of my life I have educated myself, being well-read and well mentored. I have attended at least 30 hours of continuing education training in each of the last 20 years.","I want to serve on the commission for multiple reasons.
First, I was asked to apply by someone I respect and admire as a leader in the city. I want to honor that request, and their recognition of me in the community, as a trusted person. 
Also, I love Colorado. This is my home, where I was born, and raised and have worked and built my life. I have benefited from this state and have on purpose made this my home. 
In different professional roles I have had the opportunity to see the majority of the state with my own heart and eyes. As a child, being a native of Colorado, I traveled and stayed with family in different parts in most of Southern Colorado and along what is now known as the Front Range. I feel connected to rural and frontier Colorado as well as urban centers because of my time in and connections with colleagues, friends, and family who span all of Colorado. 
I come from a multi-racial, economically and politically diverse family. This helps me to aim for options that serve the well-being of all of us. I also know what it is like to move through social tiers and change one’s life trajectory through hard work and participation in the system. I am a testament to that. 
Finally, having built my career and gained professional respect through what some would call, my own gumption, it is also through the network of generous mentors and knowledgeable guides. Many people of many walks have invested in my success. It is my purpose and choice to continue to invest in our collective good and my beloved Colorful Colorado. This commission has a worthy purpose, and I believe I will be able to contribute meaningfully to the commission’s work.","I have many years of experience in organizing, advocating for, and considering the interests of people impacted by violence crime, people impacted by social disparities, as well as with cultural communities seeking healing and well-being.  As an anti-domestic violence advocate, a trainer, a coalition staff member, a person engaged in community research, and through other related roles, I have worked to hear directly from people who are impacted, and to work with individuals and communities to find practical ways forward.  I look forward to bringing this perspective and skill set to the commission’s work on redistricting.","I am presently on the Domestic Violence Offender Management Board (DVOMB) under the Department of Criminal Justice (DCJ) in the state of Colorado. 
I am a member of the Colorado Association of Psychotherapists. 
The organization, for which I work, is a member of Violence Free Colorado (the state coalition against domestic violence).","My natural perspective tends to be strategy and reason. As a person who has had a life full of diversity of social conditions and variety of people and locations, I find that my logical mind is well-balanced with the human relationships that surround me in life. 
In my work I have worked on research teams as support and as co-investigator. I have the ability to connect, value and evaluate the data that research provides. DAta helps to shape policy. In my work, I have also provided connection and support for many victims of violence, having to provide a compassionate connection and support people in learning about and maneuvering with some sense of capacity, the various systems with which a victim of crime can come into contact. I have developed over the years a fair balance of logic and reason with humanity and fairness. Data cannot live in a vacuum, it must applied to the society in which we all live. Anecdote alone cannot be that which creates guidelines and policy, and it has a place to inform the rules of engagement.","Differing perspectives are important and valuable in building good solutions, so disagreement is not a problem, but rather an indication that indeed people are putting forward their contribution.  Moving forward once many views have been expressed is then the work of respectful dialogue, listening and considering as well as speaking. When others at the table feel heard and respected, we can talk about solutions or compromises without any personal disrespect. Keeping our eyes on the values and the goals that the commission is tasked with can help in seeing that we are all working on behalf of something none of us can achieve individually.  Fairness and impartiality in terms of respectful inclusion, while being values-led, is a cornerstone of much of the work that I do in my professional life.","My political activity has primarily consisted of being an informed voter.  Policy issues impact communities, and I take my right to vote seriously.  In addition,my very first donation to a political candidate was to Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary. I have since donated to the National Democratic Party over this past year, usually in amounts of $5-25 dollars.

Without it, the will of the people becomes distorted and subject to manipulation by a few.  While I don’t always agree with election results, I can accept them if I believe that they reflect the will of the people.  However, if I believe the elections were unfairly manipulated, the legitimacy of the results comes into question.  I believe that this commission is charged with creating electoral boundaries that will permit elections that reflect the will of the people.","In Colorado, I have been on several boards of directors, and planning committees where I have developed a reputation for asking insightful questions, and challenging untested assumptions.  After the Stem High School shooting, our church decided we should investigate how to reduce isolation and help build a more resilient society beyond the church.  A “Wellness Committee” was formed and the focus was narrowed the to young adults between ages 14 and18.  I was elected to chair the subgroup focusing on developing resilience in the 16-18 year olds.  To determine what mental health issues our target population were facing, I suggested that we add members to our advisory group who were in the 16-18 year old target age range.  We then consulted with private therapists, community mental health programs, Arapahoe/Douglas County Mental health consortium, researched the literature, and searched to find what services were already being offered to address those issues.  The Wellness Committee then made recommendations to the church.  While the Corona Virus has delayed an implementation of these recommendations, preliminary efforts are being made to establish an independent nonprofit organization to implement these suggestions to provide preventive services so that the mental health issues do not develop in the first place.

The most relevant example however, was when I was on the Interim Planning Group for the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services and I chaired a potentially contentious public hearing.  I was told that a group that was upset with HRS might attempt to disrupt the meeting.  I began the meeting by explaining the purpose of the meeting, and laying the ground rules that we would only be discussing issues related to the stated purpose of the meeting.  If people had other issues they would like to discuss, HRS staff would be available at the back of the room to discuss their issues in private.  When the first member of their group began to speak about their grievances, I politely asked if their comments were related to the topic of the meeting.  They agreed that they were not, and I suggested that they discuss their concerns with the HRS staff member at the back of the room.  This process continued through a third person from their group, after which their group no longer attempted to disrupt the meeting.  As I was leaving the meeting, by chance, I met the leader of the group in the elevator, and he apologized for his group’s behavior.  I was able to develop a solution where his group felt heard, but which did not disrupt the intended purpose of the meeting.  So often people who disrupt public meetings are doing so because they do not feel heard, and know of no other way to express their grievances.","•	St Andrew United Methodist Church,

We represented a wide variety of mental health professionals in private practice, including psychologists, mental health counselors, social workers, and marriage and family therapists, each with competing interests.  I called a board retreat to discuss what interests we had in common, and what services we could offer our members that they did not get from other organizations.  The previous President thought this would be a waste of time, but I convinced her to attend.  We looked at what we were currently offering, what other organizations were offering, and what needs weren’t being met, and decided to focus on private practice needs.  As a result, our membership rapidly increased.

As an individual investor, I have been highly successful in applying logic and reason to find promising stocks, analyzing their prospects for long term growth, and assessing obstacles and trends to obtain success.  While I pay attention to several newsletters to narrow the field of stocks to investigate, those newsletters may have biases or may discount important information which I find from other sources.  That is not to say that the stock market is always logical in the short run, or that my analysis is always correct.  But my performance beats the forecasts of many professional financial analyst’s.","In my book, Don’t Carve the Turkey with a Chainsaw: Resolving Family Conflict, I discuss how “conflict is not based on reality, but on people’s interpretations of that reality.”  To understand the other person’s interpretation of reality you must listen.  However, most people only listen to the other person’s reality 1% of the time, and when they do listen, it is to attend to information that confirms their own position and discounts contrasting information.  When you are more concerned with what YOU are saying than hearing what the other person has to say, you listen only long enough to defend your own position, or find flaws in your partner’s logic.  They do likewise, and the more they defend their position, the more they believe their own propaganda.

So, what is the best way to promote consensus?
1. First present our facts and our interpretation of the facts, giving reasons. 
2. Understand the other person’s thinking using sincere questioning and listening. Good listening involves detective work that helps uncover not only the content being expressed, but also the feelings, values, motivation, and interpretations behind the content. 
3. Focus on interests, not positions. Positions are the solutions you generate to solve a problem.  Interests are the underlying reasons influencing the decision.  It is frequently much easier to develop consensus about interests than positions. Frequently, a solution can be developed that addresses common interests, and develops a position neither party had previously considered. 
4. Brainstorm win/win solutions that focus on the future, then select the best options.  When we focus on what we want to happen in the future, rather than focusing on past misdeeds, we can avoid blaming, and the defensiveness that comes with it. 
5. Implement the solution.  
6. Evaluate the outcome using independent measures.

All this requires that the people we are dealing with feel safe, knowing that they will not be attacked, or humiliated.  Judgmental comments, insults, blaming, interrupting, interrogating questioning, all-or-nothing statements, and dishonesty all annihilate safety. “Respect is like air.  If you take it away, it’s all people can think about.  The instant people perceive disrespect in a conversation, the interaction is no longer about the original purpose—it is now about defending dignity.”

I believe my ability to be fair and impartial has been demonstrated in leadership roles where I have received considerable respect as documented by the provided letters of recommendation, and experiences.

3. Provide a voice--from someone who has knowledge & appreciation of the land, the wildlife and the growing
things in this state.","a. Along with another fellow employee–I organized & led meetings of a new employees’ organization--at Fitzsimons AMC/Dept. of Clinical Investigation (DCI) (1987-1988).  We two were responsible for (1) communicating with the employees–especially about the department head’s policy decisions and changes [A series of really sore points, at that time.] (2) communicating information about personnel policies (3) and reporting back to the chief of DCI. 

b. Currently I belong to a variety of organizations, including: Holy Cross Lutheran Church/Wheat Ridge, CO--Holy Cross-St Andrews church/La Junta, CO–Colorado Master Gardeners–Colorado State Parks Raptor Monitors–Colorado Mtn. Club/Pueblo, CO–the Danish-America museum & Genealogy Center/Elk Horn, IA–History Colorado (a.k.a. Colorado Historic Society)–& National Active and Retired Federal Employees (NARFE). 
I’m more active in some of these organizations than others–especially during this viral pandemic. I joined these organizations based on personal interest.  I try to use my interests & talents to benefit the organizations. 
For one example: I identify, & count the raptors at John Martin Reservoir State Park--every 1-2 weeks. (Raptor data–from the state parks--helps the Colorado Parks & Wildlife agency to track the overall wildlife health and food chain--in each state park.)
For another example: I have a genealogy hobby. This hobby leads me into a lot of information--about Danish & Slesvig/Schleswig immigrants, to the United States.  I’ve been able to give the Danish Genealogy Center a good amount of information–about my numerous ancestors--who immigrated from the 1870s to the 1920s.

c. On a personal level--when the COVID-19 pandemic hit Colorado–& my area (SE Colorado): After checking my own situation–I realized I was doing better than most.  But, I knew--that too many others, in Rocky Ford & Otero county--were out-of-work, out of paychecks, scared, and confused.  (There aren’t many economic opportunities or much wealth in this area.)  
I considered what I could do to help.  My “helps” so far: (1) pick up extra canned food–and deliver them, weekly-- to the local food bank in La Junta (2) pickup groceries, for my neighbor  who can’t drive, and (3) make phone calls and send cards--to friends & neighbors–who were also locked in--especially those in the senior living places.","1.

With each trouble call–I had to start by finding out what was really needed or what was really going wrong.  Then, I had to apply a good deal of reasoning/logic and computer knowledge–to find a solution. And last, I needed to explain the problem (as well as possible) to the user and tell them “what to do next time”.      

b. I’ve been a volunteer Colorado Master Gardener in Otero county–from 2007 to the present.  Most of my gardening trouble calls need my on-site investigation–gardening knowledge--research–and then reasoning--to determine (1) what the gardener’s/plant’s problem is and (2) how to resolve or deal with the problem.  

c. I am a volunteer raptor monitor at John Martin Reservoir State Park (2006 to the present). (Raptors are predator birds–such as hawks, eagles, harriers, etc.).  At the state park, I first locate  raptors. Then I use my observation skills--knowledge about raptor plumage, behaviors, and migration habits–and my logic/reasoning--to determine the actual species, I’ve found.  (I report the numbers & species to Colorado Parks & Wildlife.  They use this data to keep track of the welfare--of the state park’s wildlife.) 
						
d. One of my hobbies is genealogy: Genealogy takes a surprising amount of logic/reasoning. For example, how do I tell, if I’ve found the same ancestor--in two (or more) different records?  I need to judge dates–locations–the spelling of names & places–handwriting–handwriting, in a non-English language--other records, in a document–family stories, etc. Sometimes the records do not match up. Then I must use my reasoning–knowledge of history–and knowledge of genealogy–to make a best guess.","a. As to promoting consensus: When faced with disagreeing persons–I try to find & propose different points of view–or present other possible solutions.  
For example, I was placed on a Jefferson county jury in July 1998 (a child neglect case)–and somehow elected chairman of the jury.  At first, two or three, of the jurors--went on and on–“psychoanalyzing” and blaming the mother, for everything.  I realized--that line of debate would get us nowhere–because, you can’t get inside anybody else’s head.  So I suggested that we concentrate only on the actual physical evidence–i.e. what had been presented in court, and what had happened to the children.  That seemed to concentrate everyone’s thinking.  The jury was able to reached an agreement--and return to court--in a surprising amount of time. 

b. As to being fair or impartial: As an employee, I was recruited (occasionally), to go thru job applications or to join applicant interviews.  The applications & interviews contained all sorts of inputs–a variety negative remarks--bad grammar & spelling–”don’t care” attitudes–and political statements.  I found that I needed to “wall off” the negative & extraneous inputs. Responsibilities, experience, genuine qualifications, & awards are (hopefully) left. Then, I could make reasonable choices.","1.

For 46 years, my introductory graduate course in public service and public affairs began by teaching and modeling the “rules of civic engagement.” In a culture heavily influenced by rant-radio talk show hosts and ideologically charged political sound bites, people typically get little training on how to discuss policy issues on which they disagree deeply. This makes democracy less functional.

Groups are more effective when they follow the rules of civic engagement, which are:
•	No matter how much you disagree with someone, be more concerned with learning what they believe and why than with explaining or defending your own viewpoint.
•	No matter how illogical or uninformed they seem to be, do not shout them down, call them names, or tune them out by stereotyping them in your own mind.
•	If you have trouble with these two rules, repeat this mantra silently as you listen: “Is it possible that under any circumstances, some part of what they say might conceivably be true?” Repeat until they finish and ask you what you think.
•	If this mantra gives you trouble, do it while breathing through your nose, not your mouth.

After a few weeks of modeling, students unconsciously begin to use these rules themselves. The class transforms itself from a theater for eloquent bullies into an arena for civic engagement by a group of reflective, intelligent adults. Shouting, name-calling, and derogatory asides die out. Speakers get better at stating their views succinctly and supporting them effectively with expert opinions, personal experiences, data, and logic. Classmates turn toward the speaker, listen more closely, and interrupt less. They address questions and comments to each other by name. Little by little, as the dominant ones listen more and talk less, the quieter ones creep into the newly cleared conversational space. Soon, no one misses class except for work or family emergencies. This is how we learn together.

The principles of civic engagement transform lives and strengthen democracy. If selected for the Commission, these are the principles I pledge to follow.",Democratic National Campaign Committee (donated $$ in 2020),https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/876,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/legislative/876.html

I became interested in the redistricting process after stumbling across a monograph by Professor Robert Loevy who participated in the 2010 effort in Colorado. That spurred me to read ""RatF**ked"" by David Daley. Clearly, redistricting is a complex process involving multiple competing priorities. That type of problem is one with which I have a great deal of expertise. I have specialized expertise in data analysis and the design decision support systems. My research is focused on problems involving temporal and geo-spatial uncertainty. I believe I have a lot to offer the Colorado redistricting effort: I have the time, the interest, and the expertise. I think I also have the right demeanor -- I am an idealist but not a zealot. When facing conflict, I seek out a solution having the most good for the most stakeholders. In summary, I want to serve because I think I can add value to the process, and because I believe that a successful redistricting process in Colorado might serve as a positive model for our country.","As a faculty member at CSU, I deliberately avoided participation in special interest groups. I believe that by maintaining neutrality on political and social issues, I fostered an atmosphere with my students that promoted free exchange and critical thinking. So rather than directing my energies to causes that I admire, I have directed my service directly to my students. For example, using my uncompensated personal time to coach students for international competitions.","I have served as an officer in each of the HOAs of which I have been a member for the last 20 years, most recently as the President of the Miner's Lake HOA.","I am a decision scientist by training. I have spent more than 30 years conducting research into decision scenarios that are characterized by high stakes, time pressure, and uncertainty. My earlier work involved the study of decision making in teams and small groups, and so I am an expert in processes used to form consensus in heterogeneous groups, including Social Judgment Theory mentioned above. More recently, I have been investigating biases in judgment and perception related to geo-spatial reasoning -- for example, estimating the location of landfall for a hurricane, or the best location to search for an aircraft lost at sea. The process of redistricting involves many of these same geo-spatial biases. My research has been funded by several federal agencies, most notably the Office of Naval Research. I am especially skilled at transforming the findings of my research into practical guidance for sailors and Marines. I look forward to bringing these same capabilities to bear on the Colorado redistricting effort on behalf of all the citizens of our state.","I think the key to resolving conflict will be to discover the shared values among the stakeholders. This requires the ability to listen and have empathy. Those are skills I possess. Not all values are shared, and in that case, it is important to understand the relative importance of the goals for each stakeholder. The process of promoting consensus involves finding ways to promote the shared values while also trading-off on the relatively less-important unshared values. I have a lot of experience with this sort of small-group decision process via many years of faculty meetings and neighborhood meetings. Obviously, the stakes in those examples are much lower, but the process is the same: how do you reach agreement without creating animosity among people you work with or live near?  In particular, there is a specific analytical technique called ""Social Judgment Theory"" that has been used successfully in Colorado to resolve community disputes on important issues, and with which I have practical experience.  In the case of redistricting, I think I am aided because I don't identify with any political party, so I don't view the process through the lens of winning and losing. Rather I think I can be fair and impartial while working towards the shared goal of finding the best district boundaries that achieve the priorities of the Reapportionment Amendment and the Hobbs decision.","I have donated to Amy McGrath in her campaign against Mitch McConnell for the US Senate in Kentucky.

I believe strongly in fair elections, and while I have my own personal opinions on issues, I also deeply believe that everyone should have fair representation in elections, regardless of their opinion or position. I have been disappointed to see examples where redistricting became a tool used for voter suppression or gerrymandering and am very excited that Colorado developed a process to avoid these outcomes when redistricting. I believe I can support the process as a member of the commission with my background in leadership, communication, team-building, education, and data analysis and I would be thrilled to be of service to all Coloradans in helping to maintain fair elections.","My first experience was in 2001-2001 when I served as an Americorps community organizer for a year, working with residents of mobile home parks, lawyers, and advocates to represent the interest of mobile home residents and to lobby cities, counties and the state to promote affordable housing solutions. Recently as a member of the board of directors for the Colorado Mountain Club, I have represented the organization in a development and fundraising capacity to community partners. I have also represented my industry (outdoor/climbing industry) by participating on the board of advisors for the Warren Tech High School Outdoor Leadership Program as well as at the Climbing Wall Association annual conference, where I have participated as a panelist. In my current employment, I have also advocated internally to promote access to climbing for community groups and partners, which has led to long-term engagement with several community groups.","Board of Directors, Colorado Mountain Club, October 2019-present
Board of Industry Advisors, Warren Tech High School, Outdoor Leadership Program, 2017-present
Climbing Wall Association, 2016-present","Some of my past jobs and training have involved significant data-analysis and program evaluation, but regardless of my role I am a data seeker in my decision making process. And while I try to empathize with an emotional perspective, I do not let emotional arguments determine my decision making. As an example, in the customer service context that I operate in currently, an individual might bring up a complaint or may be vocal about an opinion. As convincing as they may be about their concern or opinion, I will dive much deeper into the root of the issue to determine if their concern is widely held or represents a larger problem, before making a decision based on one or a handful of comments. It can be tempting to make decisions based only on an individual's compelling argument or emotional plea, but I am committed to delving deeper and gathering more information to understand a problem better (and determine if it is in fact a problem) before attempting to solve it. In the real world, great data doesn't always exist, so to avoid analysis paralysis and be in a position to move forward, I supplement data-analysis with experience, seeking input, and discussing options, and considering potential outcomes before making a decision. I also keep in mind the larger goal - solving a problem should be in service of achieving our vision and mission. For example, my company's current vision is to transform the world through the experience of climbing (we run climbing gyms). When I receive input from customers, I will consider the problem of a member feeling excluded from the community much more seriously than the problem of our gym not having a sauna for member use. One problem (inclusion) is directly related to achieving our vision, the other (sauna) simply represents someone's personal preference for their gym experience, but solving that problem will not contribute materially to our overall vision. Part of the reason I would like to be involved in this commission is because I enjoy the process of problem solving and am excited to participate in the challenging process of redistricting for Colorado.","I am a big-picture thinker and in my job am frequently required to move a group toward consensus. Of course I have personal opinions on issues, but I do let let an attachment to a particular position cloud my ability to consider many perspectives and keep the larger objective in mind. I have found that my own opinions often evolve as I engage in discussion or a consensus-building process, so I have learned over the years that my initial position on may not be my final position - all of which is to say I am committed to achieving the larger goal/vision of my work than remaining attached to a particular strategy/tactic or position. I am able to listen actively and engage with people who hold perspectives different from my own to reach conclusions or take action. In a group setting such as this commission, I could play a role of facilitator, active listener, observer, and monitor (in the sense of monitoring if our work is on track or identifying if we are getting away from the bigger goal/objective). A major professional challenge I have moved through recently is a merger of two companies, and my role at a leader in the organization was to repeatedly express the vision of the company, the objectives/goals we are moving toward, gather input from stakeholders, and to have conversations that build buy-in to our new company's direction. In this process, I have been able to support two large teams in moving in a new direction, finding common ground with this direction, and generally feeling bought-in to our collective work and the outcomes. I like to approach problem solving as a collaborative learning process, where through the process we elevate the group's collective knowledge and wisdom to come up with solutions and make decisions that best serve our common goal. In this process, I may not always get ""my way,"" but I also know that a group can come up with more brilliant, practical, or elegant solutions that I could on my own, so I promote collaboration, learning, and always refocusing on our common goals. 

I believe I also am well equipped to be fair and impartial on this commission. I do not put my personal opinions/values above the larger goal, in this case supporting fair redistricting and fair elections. As a manager and supervisor, I have tried to apply principles of fairness to my teams, to reduce the possibility of favoritism or expression of bias.

I like to think of Colorado as a giant puzzle made up of 64 counties - or Mountainous or Plains - or Urban Rural, Suburban - or ... and it becomes obvious that coming up with districts that make sense, are fair, and take into account such a variety of factors - is an extreme challenge and it would be fun to solve that puzzle.","I'm not a political organizer by nature but serving as the Treasurer for both a Square Dance Club and an HOA in my past really allows you realize how an organization that seems straight-forward in its goals is comprised of so many people with different goals! Dealing with money issues as a treasurer forces you to balance the emotional feeling money (and politics) can impair or passionate people which can affect their reasoning skills. This commission would be an extension of that by treating ""groups of people (such as Democrats or Republicans)"" in a similar way as you would have to juggle individual people and viewpoints.","I've been an active member of multiple Square dance clubs in the Denver Metro area and served as Treasurer and board member for one of the clubs. I'm a member of multiple volunteer groups like the Colorado Trail Foundation, Colorado 14'ers Institute and Continental Divide Trail Coalition. A year ago I moved to Salida to live part-time while I finished my last year of work in Littleton. With the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been a challenge to get to know my new community fully with so many groups shut down but I have already participated in the local food banks and homestead ""Farm to Table"" organizations. In 2021 I will be ""retired"" in Salida full-time and look forward to much more involvement when the pandemic restrictions are lifted.","For my 38 year career, I've been a software Engineer doing coding, testing and design of complicated software that runs and monitors spacecraft designed here in Colorado. For the most recent 10 years of my career I primarily have designed automated software tests that test application and system software that others have written to verify that on a spacecraft it will perform flawlessly. Even a very minor mistake can result in the lost of the functionality of a spacecraft that costs 100's of millions of dollars to build, launch and operate. Using logic and analytical skills are my two strongest traits. For engineers, it can be very difficult to use that approach with others and have the ability to understand the intuitive and emotional nature of people which you have to consider to really understand the problem and come up with the best solutions that may at first not seem like the most logical.","I have traveled though nearly every county and major town in Colorado so I think I can relate to the viewpoints of people who live in the wide variety of places in this state.

KL&A Engineers & Builders in Golden, CO","Master's degree in structural engineering from the University of Colorado in Boulder (2020), Bachelor's degree in civil engineering from Colorado State University in Fort Collins (2018)","I would like to serve on the commission because I want to ensure that the representative district boarders are drawn fairly without the effects of gerrymandering. As an unaffiliated voter, generally displeased with the two party system, I am interested in making sure the Colorado State representatives in congress are elected fairly and competitively. 

Colorado unfortunately has a history of gerrymandering in order to give one political party more power over another. Districting commissions often also re-draw districting lines in order to protect their own seat (or the incumbent member of their party) in office. These tactics need to stop in order for the voice of the people of Colorado to truly be heard. If the districts are organized such that the representative earns the votes of their constituents. This is very important to me as a Colorado voter because not only to I want my voice to be heard and  I want to ensure the same for my fellow Coloradans.

The great President John F. Kennedy said, “Let us not seek the Republican answer of the Democratic answer, but the right answer. Let us not seek to fix the blame for the past. Let us accept our own responsibility for the future.” My primary goal as a member of this commission will be to seek that right answer. I love this state, and I believe that the governmental tactics and changes taking place here in Colorado have been and continue to be a model for the nation. That is why I am interested in serving on the commission, not only to serve my state but to serve my country.","As a general contractor, it was important to maintain a positive relationship with all of the trade partners working on site to keep them coordinated and functional. As a project engineer with Martines Palmeiro Construction (MPC) I had to advocate for both the organizations who worked under mine and our clients in the day-to-day tasks in the field. Often times a trade partner would interfere with another trade partner’s work for their own convenience. I had to ensure that the best interests of all the trades were executed in order maintain a functional site. Furthermore, it was also my responsibility to ensure that the best interests of the owner were being executed despite the fact that the owner was not present on site. Nearly all of the trade partners I worked with are based in Colorado, as many of them are small businesses in the Denver area.","I spent the majority of the past five years since November 10, 2015 as a student at both Colorado State University (CSU) in Fort Collins and University of Colorado (CU) in Boulder. Because of this most of my public involvement was within my university community. At CSU I served as student ambassador for the College of Engineering, which I belonged to. As an ambassador I worked primarily with high school students considering majoring in engineering, at CSU or otherwise. I gave advice to these students as they made their college decisions and offered my perspective to them as both an engineering student and as a CSU Ram. 

At the end of my undergraduate education at CSU, I joined a professional origination known as the Order of the Engineer. This is an organization that upholds the ethical standards of engineers in our society. As many people entrust their lives with the structures and technology designed by engineers, this organization continuously reminds them of the responsibly they hold.

In graduate school at CU, I earned a scholarship from the Structural Engineers Association of Colorado (SEAC) and have attended a number of meetings and site visits with the organization since. Although I am not an official SEAC member, I am currently considering joining this organization as well.","Being a structural engineer, logic and reason come very naturally to me. I am a fast learner and an analytical thinker. I am exceptionally good at Excel and I enjoy solving mathematically interesting problems. I am also a young and enthusiastic individual who likes a good challenge. 

When I was a graduate student at CU, I had to apply these skills to my research project in order to report accurate and unbiased results. For this project, I was tasked investigating the effects of a polymer additive on the freeze-thaw properties of concrete. To do this, I had to college and analyze a significant amount of data over the course of several months. I also had to write and defend my thesis in front of several faculty members and concrete experts to prove my results were valid. I would take a similar approach to the task of re-districting Colorado. My “data collection” phase would involve hearing the voices of my fellow Coloradans scattered throughout the state. My “analysis” phase would be the actual re-drawing of the district lines with the assistance of the other commissioners. And finally my “defense” phase would be to convince and mediate among the other members of the committee.","As a member of the commission, I will advocate for the use of the shortest-split line method to divide the voters throughout the state into fairly divided, equally populated areas. The use of this algorithm is at least a good place to start, because it uses a mathematical method that is free of bias. I would also use that as an argument among the other commissioners, because you can’t argue with math. As an engineer, I am good at both being analytical and convincing of an impartial answer.

Next, I think it’s worth considering the cultural density of the various areas of the state. For example, because Baca County and Prowers County are culturally similar to each other, it may make sense to group them together in the same district. However, it is important to make sure there is a healthy amount of competition for the candidates running to represent these districts. For example if it is known that the majority of voters in Weld County are Republicans and the majority of voters in Larimer County are Democrats, it may make sense to group Weld and Larimer County together in the same district to encourage both the Republican and Democratic candidates for that district to campaign harder to earn their votes","In the past five years, I have been interested but not heavily involved in political activities outside of voting. I have not given money to any organizations other than the perchance a Marco Rubio bumper sticker in 2016. At the end of 2019 I also signed a petition in Colorado that put Proposition 115 on the 2020 ballot and made a $5 donation supporting the initiative.

Although I grew up in a mostly conservative household, I am an independent thinker who may align with the Libertarian party rather than the Democratic or Republican party. I even voted Libertarian in 2016 because I felt that both of the two major candidates were not representative of how most people in America think.

My goal will be to ensure that the inaugural commission will become the gold standard for independent redistricting commissions in the nation. I acknowledge that this will not be an easy task because our highly mobile society has allowed us to sort ourselves into clusters of like-minded neighbors of similar demographics and income levels. Despite our competing interests, the citizens of Colorado are calling for the highest standards and have rejected having their elections be decided by partisan computer algorithms that dilute their voice in good government. I see my role as a commissioner to objectively and impartially implement the new constitutional requirements for equitable and competitive election districts.","As a council-appointed member of the Colorado Springs 2020 Districting Process Advisory Committee, I represented the fastest growing district of over 81,000 people-- a population slightly larger than Loveland. My role included soliciting input on the proposed boundaries, conducting the public outreach meeting, and synthesizing the comments for the committee report. I also worked with my fellow committee members and studied maps of demographic information to ensure that neighborhoods with a higher number of ethnic minorities were fairly represented in our recommendations for redistricting.","Member of the City of Colorado Springs 2020 Districting Process Advisory Committee.

Using math and logic to create solutions is my profession. I strive to be a System 2 Thinker. In 2014 I served as an expert witness on a complex patent case in federal district court involving database security which required deep analysis of the subject matter and an understanding of the law. Since July 2020 I have applied my analytical skills to assist the Colorado Springs City Clerk with redistricting the City Council District boundaries based on election precincts and demographic data for a city of approximately 481,000 residents. I created web-based maps using shapefiles and GIS software to help my colleagues on the advisory committee better understand the relationship between the proposed district boundaries and the local communities of interest.","It is remarkable to witness the wisdom emerge from a diverse group of reasonable and intelligent individuals working toward a common goal. Being part of a group starts with humility and an understanding that no one individual has all the answers. Forming consensus requires preparation, amending one’s opinion when presented with new information, putting into practice the principles of active listening, and ensuring that all voices are heard. Consensus is not unanimous consent but rather an outcome built on mutual respect, judicious deliberation, and authentic inclusion of minority viewpoints.","I have been a regular voter in Colorado since 1994.

This endeavor took two years and many hours of meetings, listening and collaborating with people from different cultures used to different practices.

This past summer, one of my interns from Northern Ireland was going to be assigned to a mental health support with the City of Broomfield when the pandemic cancelled those plans. My long term focus is to have this be a Colorado and Northern Ireland collaborative outreach to young people.","The Irish Network of Colorado, Mile High Writers Group, Project Children","Recognizing a problem exists is the first step. This commission is that first step. The process is then determining a desired outcome to resolve the problem and the road to take to reach that point. Reaching the summit of all of Colorado's fourteen thousand foot mountains is not a straightforward process. Having achieved this feat, I learned along the way how to navigate where there was no clear path using a combination of assessment of the slope and whether it was attainable. If not, regroup and try another path. This metaphor reflects my ability to see a challenge, pay attention to the environment, test hypothesis, and focus on the task at hand. In a social situation, listening to the other person and determining what is actually being said, is critical to finding common ground.

As in the negotiations of the Good Friday Agreement, led by Senator George Mitchell and later implemented by our own former State Department liaison, Jim Lyons, the key to any process of this importance is determining common understanding of terminology used by all interested parties. This lays the foundation for effective dialogue and negotiations.

I believe the key to having a functional government lies in reducing the ability of any party to twist the will of the voters and that in a proportional representational system, ensuring that the proportions are fair and equal is the first step to ensuring that the will of the electorate is maintained.  I believe that we need more people who are not members of any party, and therefore, lack a vested interest in seeing their 'team"" win. I also feel that my background in QA is something that is needed on the commission. QA requires a unique perspective where your main goal is to point out flaws without making them into personal attacks. The role of QA is to keep people honest about the state of things, not only to the customer but within the organization itself. I feel that this is a necessary function that is often overlooked when trying to build a high performing team.",I lack formal experience in participating in these groups. I have been a member of organizations like Trout Unlimited but until recently my advocacy was strictly on a personal basis.  I have spent a lot of time working with friends and acquaintances to discuss the issues and platforms I feel are important for Colorado.,,"In my daily life as a QA engineer, I spend the vast majority of my time analyzing the work of other people. I am trained to look for logical flaws in calculations. I understand that trust comes from testing and confirmation, not pretty presentation or slick graphics. I write user stories and test cases constantly, using logic and reason to analyze how any particular program or piece of data will be used. Formal logic is a large part of determining positive and negative paths for test cases. I use reason to perform root cause analysis and identify areas of regression.
I am experienced in handling large data sets, data transformations, graphing, and statistics. I am capable of taking raw data sets and writing my own queries and analysis in several different programming languages and tools. I have spent years analyzing calculations that others have written looking for flaws in logic and reason. I have previously worked with a wide variety of data type including demographic data, economic data, and medical billing data.  I am well versed in performing needs analysis, regression analysis, happy path and negative path testing, and gap analysis. 

In terms of skills, I have taken courses in formal logic, economics, business, mathematics, and philosophy. I am a certified Agile Scrum Master and Product Owner. I have taken training in Project Management and interpersonal relationships. I have experiencing leading teams of other engineers. 
Some of the projects I have worked on include: Writing a web application to handle mortgage applications, developing an HR system to track employee complaints, doing document analysis to assemble evidence for EPA criminal prosecutions, programming predictive dialing systems for customer service agents, and performing security auditing at a credit agency. I am currently employed at a DoD contractor working on network security software.","As a QA lead and release manager, I have spent the last decade working to build consensuses between various stakeholders involved in a a number of different projects. I recognize that it is important to hear and address all voices that have an interest in the outcome, but that you cannot let the perfect become the enemy of the good. Sooner or later you have to make decisions and an imperfect decision made timely is better than a perfect decision made too late. You will never fix all bugs in a piece of software, or in a redistricting map, but that doesn't mean you can't release a good or even great piece of work. I believe that the key to being a functional team is to have a strong set of core values and working towards those. As long as you have strategic alignment, individual issues become a series of small tactical compromises that allow each group to feel their voice is being heard. I would work to identify the strategic goals of the commission and apply software engineering methodology, where appropriate, to resolve the disagreements. Software development is a lot like politics, as it should be a meritocracy but in reality tends to be dominated by individuals with strong personalities. I believe the techniques I have used to achieve success dealing with programmers would translate well to building strong working relationships with other members of the commission.

My aim in doing so is to become a fully-qualified commissioner on day one.","My overall approach is to recommend what is best for Colorado as a whole.  We have a strong state with many positive aspects, none of which I want to see diminished or endangered.  I want to listen carefully to what everyone has to say.  Ultimately, this commission will be considering tradeoffs between different criteria. Since there will be no straightforward, universal consensus on what is ""fair"", I believe we should first establish ground rules on what we will prioritize based on legal requirements, community input, staff guidance, and the unique attributes that make Colorado great.  As we move into looking at partitioning plans, I would respectfully guide the commission to play by those ground rules.  We do, however, have guidance on what is not fair: gerrymandered district partitions.  I will keep a keen eye out for that and question all proposals that look to contain outlier partitions not allowed in the ground rules.",No past political activity.

My academic training was mostly in philosophy (with a smattering of political science), and one of my main interests was in ethics.  The intersection of democracy and ethics is the notion of equity for all citizens; viz. that every person has equal say and power to shape the nature of the political bodies which affect his/her live.

The way that voting districts are set up is, obviously, the foundation of whether any particular system is equitable or not.  Redistricting has been used for partisan purposes—by all political parties—from well before Governor Gerry ‘gerrymandered’ the Massachusetts districts in 1812 up to today.  This has been the source of a considerable lack of fairness in our political system.

I am proud of Colorado for being a leader in the movement to take the redistricting function away from legislatures in order to try to come up with a fair and rational process which will benefit all citizens in a equitable fashion.  This is an important step forward both for Colorado, and through our example, for the rest of the country.  I would be honored and excited to be able to participate in this important work.","As a dealer in antiquarian maps and prints, I joined the board of the Denver Public Library Friends Foundation almost as soon as I moved to Colorado, from Philadelphia, in 2010.  The library holds an important collection of western material, and both my wife and I are long term supporters of reading as a means for children and adults to improve their lives.  Even once I left the board, I have continued to work with the Friends, running a number of programs for them to help raise awareness and money, including some ""Antiques Roadshow"" type events (I have been a regular appraiser on that TV program) and giving regular, free lectures on maps and prints.  

I have also been a board member of the Rocky Mountain Map Society, running both their regular lecture programs and their annual Map Month every May (except this one).  These are all free programs open to the public.

My wife and I have been regular supporters of a number of local arts groups, including Wonderbound and the Baroque Chamber Orchestra of Colorado, as well as local history related groups such as Historic Denver, History Colorado, Colorado Preservation, and Four Mile Historic Park.  I worked as a board member of the BCOC for three years.","Board member, Denver Public Library Friends Foundation, 2010-2014; Board member, Baroque Chamber Orchestra of Colorado, 2015-2018; Board member, Rocky Mountain Map Society, 2005-current; Board member, American Historical Print Collectors Society, 2010-2015, 2019-current","I studied philosophy in higher education institutions for almost a decade, and indeed originally planned to teach philosophy as a profession.  Two of my main areas of study were ethics and logic.  The latter is something which I feel is a sine non qua for any rational argument, and indeed I have taught a class in informal logic to high school students as I think it is a skill necessary for any “reasoned life.”  I believe one of my most important and strong skills is the ability to reason in a logical manner.","I believe that I am intellectually suited and trained to be able to wrestle with the issues that a redistricting committee will face, I have a very strong sense of the importance of fairness, I have strong organizational skills, and, of course, I also am very well versed in map related subjects.

My academic training was much focused on philosophical argument, in the sense of being able to take an open-minded and clear-eyed look at the issues involved in any particular question to be decided.  I have the ability to identify the core issues of various questions and to present them in a clear and unbiased manner.  Even if I disagree with another person in an argument, I am adept at understanding his/her viewpoint and am able to lay out exactly where and why we disagree.  This does not always solve the argument, but it at least lets the parties understand the real issues involved.

In terms of fairness, my belief in the fundamental importance of fairness is rooted in the moral belief which I hold to be the most important to live by, viz. that everyone should treat others as they wish to be treated.  If one follows this Golden Rule, then fairness necessarily follows, as no one would want to be treated unfairly by another.  I have mostly supported the Democratic Party in the last decade or so, but that support is circumstantial; my support for a fair, equitable political system is far more foundational to my beliefs.","I was a Precinct Committee Person for the Democratic Party, Precinct 623, House District 6, from 2015 to 2016.

For the 10 years before then, I was a Social Studies teacher at Grandview High School in the Cherry Creek School District in Aurora, CO.  During that time I also occasionally worked on a contract basis for Educational Testing Service to write AP exam questions in AP U.S. Government & Politics and AP Comparative Government & Politics, and also worked on a contract basis with the publishing firm Bedford, Freeman & Worth to help edit a textbook now widely used in teaching AP U.S. Government & Politics.","B.A. in Political Science from the State University of New York at Buffalo (1973)
J.D. from Harvard Law School (1976)
Teacher Education Program from the University of Denver resulting in a teaching certificate (2001)","First, because doing so reflects who I am.  It sounds like serving on the commission will involve hard work for the public's benefit in exchange for little pay.  That's exactly what I did as a teacher for the past 19 years.  

Second, because I have a particular interest in the commission's goals.  I studied Political Science in school, and have had a lifelong fascination with that topic.  Two of the courses I taught for many years, AP U.S. Government & Politics and AP Human Geography, address the issue of gerrymandering.  And my teaching of We the People required that I become familiar with the constitutional, legal, and political issues involved in drawing political boundaries, including one-person-one-vote, the need for contiguity, a preference for compactness and communities of interest, and the Supreme Court's creative distinction between racial gerrymandering (prohibited in Shaw v. Reno (1993)) and political gerrymandering (allowed in Rucho v. Common Cause (2019)) even though there's a clear correlation between race and political leanings.  I want to do my part to enhance democratic principles in Colorado, so it can serve as a model for the country.

Third, because I have ample time to devote to the commission's work now that I'm retired.  And I have the good fortune to be healthy and energetic enough to handle the workload.

And fourth, because I'm confident I can serve faithfully and honorably, helping to produce a map that the people of Colorado can take pride in.","As a first year attorney, I participated in my own small way in assisting others who were then luminaries in the Colorado legal community to create the Colorado Lawyers Committee.  Later in my law practice, I joined the Board of Directors of the Lawyers Committee.  I've contributed to that organization for decades, continuing to do so throughout my teaching career and even in retirement.  And in coordination with the Lawyers Committee, I served as one of three lead counsel in Hafer v. Romer (1990), in which I represented a group of school districts, school administrators, parents of school-age children, and taxpayers who collectively challenged the constitutionality of the then-existing system of funding public schools in Colorado.  My colleagues and I pursued that lawsuit for many months, and achieved our clients' main goals when the Colorado General Assembly enacted a far more equitable formula for financing public education throughout the state that -- while not perfect by any means -- nevertheless dramatically reduced the funding disparity between property-rich and property-poor school districts.     

Also, while I was actively practicing law, I volunteered extensively for the Colorado Bar Association, serving on its Ethics Committee for 15 years and its Grievance Policy Committee for 5 years, and serving as Chair of the latter. 

Finally, since retiring from teaching, I've reactivated my law license for the sole purpose of performing pro bono work through Colorado Legal Services.","(1) Since November 10, 2015 I've been a member of the National Council for the Social Studies, an organization promoting the teaching of civic education.  (2) During that same time, in the course of teaching AP U.S. Government & Politics, I worked closely with (and contributed to) the Colorado Center for Civic Learning and Engagement which sponsors the We the People program in Colorado.  We the People is a nationwide competition of constitutional analysis, and is the single best educational program I've encountered.  I'll briefly describe this program elsewhere in this application, though Judge Daniel Taubman and Andrea Shpall, in their letters of recommendation accompanying my application, shed further light on what it encompasses.  (3) My community includes my synagogue, where for many years I've regularly served as a Gabbai responsible for ensuring the Torah is read correctly, and I also serve as an occasional Torah reader.","I had the good fortune to receive the best legal training imaginable, not merely from a fine law school but also from two of the most insightful and analytical attorneys I've ever known: Hardin Holmes and Ken Starr (the lawyer, not the judge, though I appeared before the judge when he sat on the D.C. Circuit).  In the course of a 25-year law career, my analytical horizons were broadened by the opportunity to work with law colleagues of differing races, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations, as well as by a diverse clientele encompassing billionaires and welfare recipients, Fortune 500 companies and mom-and-pop businesses.  I represented those clients, applying logic and reason in the process, in a wide variety of civil, criminal, domestic, juvenile, probate, administrative, tax, and bankruptcy matters on both a fee-generating and pro bono basis.  While my law practice was varied, I focused on complex commercial litigation, requiring me in jury trials -- some lasting many weeks -- to convey detailed concepts in straightforward ways while still respecting the jurors' intelligence.  (As matters ended up, I used similar skills in my classroom teaching difficult concepts to my students.)  And when I practiced law, Martindale-Hubbell compiled my fellow lawyers' views of my analytical skills by awarding me a rating of ""av,"" the highest rating given.    

You have better things to do than read some of my trial and appellate filings, though they would serve as ample evidence of my analytical skills.  But at least one piece of my writing is still publicly available (I think), namely the chapter on Colorado Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1 (involving derivative actions, a fairly sophisticated topic) in Colorado Civil Procedure Forms and Commentary (D. Knapp, ed.).  

Some might think that my need to apply logic and reason to a problem would lessen as I transitioned to teaching, a key period in my life described in my personal statement accompanying this application, but that wasn't so.  I created a large number of lesson plans that sought to reach students on many levels, visual as well as auditory, kinetic as well as contemplative.  And I created course binders for my students ranging in length from 600 to 800 pages in three of the subjects I taught (AP U.S. Government & Politics, AP Comparative Government & Politics, and AP Human Geography) that contained all of the notes, articles, activities, organizers, vocabulary, and review materials used over the course of a year of teaching, and then -- after updating those materials yearly -- freely shared them with my teaching colleagues, as my former teaching colleague Terri Bramhall notes in her accompanying letter of recommendation.

In fact, I would make the case that interacting with teenagers on a sustained basis -- trying to motivate them while they struggle with their emotions, their intellect, their friends, their family lives, their self-image, their emerging sexuality, their hormones -- demanded a greater number of analytical skills, more logic and reason, than I ever needed as an attorney.","A former student gave me a T-shirt that reads, ""Teachers do what lawyers do, only with less pay, more judges, and a tougher jury.""  I wear that shirt with pride.  Teenagers are the hardest audience imaginable.  They're going through profound physical and psychological changes, while also struggling to find their own identity and their place in the world.  And to compound matters, my students came from highly diverse households, racially, ethnically, linguistically, religiously, economically, and politically.  

Promoting consensus is necessary to succeed as a high school teacher.  So is the need to make each student feel as though they're being treated fairly and impartially.  The first step in reaching any student is to make her/him feel welcome, part of a supportive learning environment.  I learned early in my teaching career that if I treat my students with honesty, honor, and respect -- if I love them for who they are, see what they're capable of becoming, and model how they can get there -- they'd walk through fire to achieve their goals.  And my approach to teaching worked.  My students enjoyed overwhelming success over the course of my 19-year teaching career, with 97% of them passing their AP exams despite a nationwide pass rate of (depending on the exam and year) roughly between 50 and 60%.  I took particular pride in the success enjoyed by my students of color, many of whom had been underserved in their earlier schooling.  (Grandview has never imposed any prerequisites or academic requirements for any student to enroll in its AP courses, and has actively encouraged all students, no matter their background, to sign up for them.)  And along the way, I received many teaching awards, among them Teacher of the Year at Grandview High School, Teacher of the Year for the Cherry Creek School District, Social Studies Teacher of the Year for the State of Colorado, and even Social Studies Teacher of the Year for the United States.  

I'm applying here for a spot on a redistricting commission, not another teaching award.  But to appreciate how I can build consensus, create agreement within a diverse group, and interact with others fairly and impartially, it will help you to understand how I succeeded in doing these precise things with the toughest audience I've ever encountered.  

Teaching the subject of government requires a particular focus on fairness and impartiality.  I taught in a community whose political views spanned the political spectrum.  In his accompanying letter of recommendation, my former principal and district superintendent Harry Bull writes about my desire to give credence to right-of-center as well as left-of-center political loyalties.  Though I openly rejected fringe viewpoints from both ends of the spectrum, I never considered my classroom to be a political platform.  To the contrary, I always believed that my role as a teacher was to prod the students to learn how to think, not what to think.  That was best exemplified by the large sign in my classroom on the wall that faced my door and greeted every student each day upon entering my room, containing one word: ""Think . . . . .""   This should give you a sense of my willingness to respect the logic of a political position I happen not to share.  Doing so will be crucial to working with Republicans and Independents on the commission.  

Moreover, I watched the results of consensus-building -- and honed my own talents at achieving it -- in the course of guiding my students for over 10 years through the We the People program.  Participation in that program was a required component of my year-long course in AP U.S. Government & Politics.  It will help you, in assessing my application, to understand what that remarkable program encompasses.  You can learn about it by accessing https://www.civiced.org/we-the-people, though Judge Taubman and Ms. Shpall add insight about it in their letters of recommendation.  

Students enrolled in We the People are assigned to six small groups that analyze the Constitution from different perspectives, including its historic and philosophical underpinnings, how it operates in theory and in practice, and what constitutional issues are particularly relevant in the 21st Century.  Because the program's organizers address different constitutional issues each year, I immersed myself in widespread constitutional analysis to a far greater extent than I had ever done in my law practice or even in my Constitutional Law course taken in 1974.  But by far, the greatest challenge I encountered in that program was teaching my students the art of consensus building.  Each grouping of students was called upon to make a coherent, cooperative presentation to a panel of judges; and in fact, per the WTP scoring formula, the judges would deduct points if any individual student tried to hoard the spotlight at the expense of his or her group mates.  

And so, in the course of over 10 years, working with six WTP groups each year, I helped over 60 groupings of students reach consensus on a wide variety of complex issues.  That required a great deal of time and effort, as Judge Taubman and Ms. Shpall detail in their letters, calling upon me to contribute emotional support as well as constitutional analysis; but I'm enormously proud of the success my students enjoyed each year, where they placed either first or second in the State of Colorado and participated in two WTP national competitions, each time winning awards for their presentations.  (We were invited to Washington a third time this past spring, yet another event interrupted by COVID.)  

Finally, my ability to interact with others, including -- in the context of this application -- other members of the commission can be seen in one additional way.  I'm proud to say that while I was teaching, many of my former students would go out of their way to stay in touch.  For reasons I could never fully explain, my former students living in the area would frequently return to Grandview, to share with me their college experiences, to ask for my analysis of current events bearing on issues we'd studied in class, and to show off their significant other, their spouse, and occasionally even their kids.  And former students, including those living out of state and abroad, would often communicate as well via email.  Just last week, for instance, a former student who graduated in 2010 emailed me an invitation to his upcoming wedding.  One of my favorite emails was received last year from a former student who had graduated from Grandview in 2007.  That former student, who is now a Social Studies teacher in Utah, wanted to share with me the lessons he'd learned in my classroom about how to teach.  After detailing a number of my teaching methods, recounted with remarkable accuracy twelve years after the fact, this former student concluded with this: ""My students may not know your name, but they know a lot about the kind of teacher you are, because it determines so much about the kind of teacher I try to be.""  This testimonial is gratifying and humbling, but it also speaks volumes about how I treat others.  

I try to respect everyone I encounter.  But respecting others doesn't mean kowtowing to them.  I'll no doubt disagree on occasion with some of my fellow commissioners.  That will require give-and-take, and hopefully an ability to convince the commission as a whole of the strength of my logic.  I promise to hold true to what I believe, but also to listen carefully to opposing viewpoints in order to try to achieve a consensus that will advance the interests of all Coloradans.","Following a brief foray into campus politics, which I mention in my resume, I turned to helping others reach their political goals.  Over the years I've volunteered at a low organizational level on many political campaigns, including Barack Obama's (2008 and 2012), Hillary Clinton's (2016), and Joe Biden's (2020) presidential runs.  Since retiring, I've devoted roughly 200 hours to the Biden campaign focusing on the battleground state of Wisconsin, mostly on a special assignment to increase voter access in Democratic-leaning areas of that state by enlisting 16 and 17-year old high school students to serve as poll workers -- something permitted under Wisconsin law.  To accomplish that, I helped as needed to coordinate the efforts of teachers, principals, school superintendents, and municipal clerks in key regions throughout Wisconsin.  

As for political donations, since November 10, 2015 I've contributed money to the following campaigns: Hillary Clinton for President, Joe Biden for President, Andrew Romanoff for Senate (primary campaign), John Hickenlooper for Senate (general election campaign), Jason Crow for House of Representatives (CO -- 6th CD),  Hillary Scholten for House of Representatives (MI -- 3rd CD), and Christina Finello for House of Representatives (PA -- 1st CD).  As I interpret the term ""political organizations,"" since November 2015 I've contributed to three PACs (the Committee to Protect Medicare PAC, A Woman's Place PAC, and the Lincoln Project) and four other organizations (the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Planned Parenthood, the Sierra Club, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)) that I gladly supported precisely because of their political activities.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/953,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/legislative/953.html

In governmental and civic situations when i see adults arguing  am reminded of my classroom days. The secret is not to get flustered or upset but to deal with the underlying issues of contention and discuss them rationally. I moderate quite well.
In addition, as mentioned above, having lived in several types of communities throughout the state and having belonged to various political parties I feel that I have a leg up on what drives people to disagree and what it takes to accommodate those differences.","MB Mcafee for county commissioner

Recently it seems like changes have been made in boundaries that have made it nearly impossible for a given candidate to win a specific office.,"The best recent example would be the 13 years that I spent as an irrigation canal representative on the Rio Grande Water Conservation District Sub District 1 Board, who was charged with developing a water plan that would reduce pumping and revive the rapidly declining aquifer that is the lifeblood of the San Luis Valley. We had nearly endless meetings and public hearings where we would listen to concerns and suggestions on how to attempt to meet our goal. After developing a compromise plan that was approved by several entities, including the State Engineer and District Water Court, we are currently working towards our goal.  With the current drought and increasing efforts from outside our river basin to export water the issue of underground water is still a huge one.  The County Planning Commission is also a board that has to deal with sometimes very contentious issues concerning the growth and development of the community. As a commission member I always listened and tried to do what seemed to be best for the entire community. I also served 10 years on our local school board.","Rio Grande County Republicans, Colorado Republican Party, Alamosa Christian Science Society (Church Board Chairman), Rio Grande County Planning and Zoning Commission, Rio Grande Water Conservation/Sub District 1 Board of Directors, and Colorado Farm Bureau State Board of Directors.",When you start from a severe deficit and attempt to develop a plan that protects the economy and improves the eco system you must review a lot of data and form an opinion that you should not be afraid to defend. And when new data supports corrective action you should not be afraid to make changes.,It is my hope that fairness and balance in government is still important to Colorado voters. Previous comments to me on my votes and service on other boards for the most part have been positive and supportive. As I move on from most of these boards I was thanked by others who in some cases may have disagreed with my view on a specific issue.,"I have attended Party State Conventions.

I worked in several different departments doing various jobs: telephone customer service, hypotheticals, some minor mainframe trouble shooting, internet support, technical writing and helping to build the company's intranet. I'm good at learning new skills, troubleshooting, and getting to the root of a problem through analyzing data. In my work that included sorting through legal and technical documents, and often involved handling large sums of money and short deadlines. 

From my understanding, redistricting involves finding a way to draw borders in such a way that communities get a voice that represents their population accurately, without diluting or silencing voices. Considering the many ways that our communities overlap and shift, I imagine that is a complex and challenging puzzle. I am trained as an artist to see patterns and sort out relevant information. Usually for me that is a visual endeavor, but I can see it being of use in this project: Observing the different possibilities and figuring out which shapes best represent our population.","I have always believed that collaboration leads to the best solutions. I will keep a calm head and make sure that I understand all sides before making my choices. It's hard to anticipate what the challenges of such a commission will be, but the fairness that I want to provide as a result of this work will be a guide to my participation in it. I believe that everyone deserves a voice, even people I don't agree with (provided that they are not advancing an agenda of hate towards a particular group).

I voted for and was very happy when the Amendments Y and Z passed in 2018. Fair maps are crucial for our state and it would be an honor to be a part of this process. 
Since I moved here in 2016, I have been active at local and state levels to offer my time and capabilities. Serving on one of these commissions would be my greatest contribution to Colorado.","When Broomfield announced residential drilling pads coming close to our neighborhood, I got involved in various ways to protect the health and safety of our residents. I helped to organize the Oil and Gas Education Group to inform our residents about the drilling process. I testified at various COGCC hearings and rule making sessions about the negative health impacts on our residents. I got active with LOGIC because it unites the voices of impacted residents to strengthen them. I testified at the legislative hearings in support of SB-181. I am on a citizen regulatory advisory committee to ensure that Broomfield's new oil and gas regulations are most protective of residents health, wildlife, and environment. I did all of this to protect the health and safety of our residents and my neighbors.","I volunteered at my grandsons' elementary school from 2014-17. 
I am one of the originators of the Oil and Gas Education Group at Anthem Ranch and have served as co-chair since 2016.

I have served on the board of League of Oil and Gas Impacted Coloradans (LOGIC) since 2017 and am now board president. 
I served on the Broomfield Advisory Committee on Environmental Sustainability 2018-20. 
I am active in the Volunteer Club at Anthem Ranch. 
I serve on the Aspen Lodge Committee at Anthem Ranch and I am the secretary. 
I volunteer each year on Earth Day as part of the clean up team.","Being a problem solver, I put a great deal of effort into researching the issue and looking at all sides of it. I am a detail-oriented person but I also keep the big picture in mind so I don't lose sight of the larger goal. 
Teamwork provides the opportunity for stronger ideas and solutions through consensus building so I will work to bring all voices together.","I am a problem solver. I listen to both sides of issues and work to bring folks together. I work to be sure all voices are heard and listened to. I take constant notes so ideas are not forgotten or lost. I also work hard to get the job done and I am always willing to do what it takes to complete a project.
I worked hard to keep my oil and gas work apolitical. My only concern is the health and safety of our residents.
On the Broomfield Advisory Committee on Environmental Sustainability, I met with members who disagreed on the goals we were creating. I wanted each one to be honored for their ideas and knowledge. At our meetings, I guaranteed each member had time to discuss the concerns they had. Once the explanations were shared, the different members came together to work to work toward common goals, a process that I helped facilitate.
Finally, I also worked as an educator of staff development for teachers. It was my job to bring new ideas into the classrooms. Through my presentations and relationships with teachers, I was able to empower them to make important changes.","I donated to: Joe Neguse, Joseph Biden, Barrack Obama, Matt Gray, Leslie Robinson, Sara Loflin, Laurie Anderson, Jean Lim, Deven Shaff, Broomfield Amendment 301",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/912,https://github.com/cjwinchester/co-redistricting-commission-applicants/blob/master/legislative/912.html
