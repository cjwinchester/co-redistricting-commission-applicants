In my view, both Democratic and Republican parties have become too self-serving in a way that seeks to concentrate and solidify political power instead of representing their citizens' membership with an intent to govern responsibly.  One of the approaches that the parties have taken is to seek to gerrymander various systems to favor their party interests at the expense of individual citizens.

I would like to serve on the commission because I want to apply my problem-solving skills that I have refined throughout my career to public service.   I have enjoyed volunteering throughout my life, I have enjoyed taking on new challenges, and I also enjoyed collaborating with others to find solutions, and I view becoming a member of the commission as a natural extension.","When I was involved with the IEEE organization, I helped organize numerous events promoting the Electrical Engineering profession in this state and the industries that hire those professionals.  As an organization, we created networking events, presentations by guest speakers, round table discussions, and even flew to Washington, DC to help lobby for everything from improvements in energy policies to immigration – all areas that would directly or indirectly bring more clean technology jobs to Colorado.","My career  has kept me from being more involved than I desire, but I am happy to say that I was an active volunteer for 13 years for Stargate School in Thornton, CO until the spring of 2019 when my youngest son graduated from that school.

As a Stargate volunteer, I donated time to the school in a variety of capacities: I helped the school with its information technology systems, chaired their Website Committee, and most importantly, chaired their Election Committee where we organized, executed, and ratified two elections per year with over 1000 stakeholders whereby we elected board members, elected committee members, and adopted changes to the bylaws.  Volunteering for Stargate was extremely rewarding.

I am currently a member of Mosaic Lodge #184 AF&AM, in East Lake, CO, a member of the Denver Consistory, a Shriner (Shriners Children’s Hospitals), a member of the Advisory Committee of the Broomfield Chapter of DeMolay, and a former Section Chair of the Denver Section of IEEE (Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers).","My education has instilled in me a strong sense of logic and reason.  In addition, analysis, critical thinking, and ongoing education are critical skills that I continue to rely upon in my profession protecting data, keeping computers secure, defending against cyber threats, and staying one step ahead of hackers in our technology-driven word.

Throughout my career, I have been pragmatic professional where I have used my analytical skills to make the best decisions, even if the information available is not perfect.  In those cases where information is vague or contradicts itself (and that seems to happen frequently), I have used logic, reasoning, communication, collaboration, and courage to find the best solution possible.","The first and most important step promoting consensus among the commissioners is to never loose sight of the commission’s objectives and responsibilities.  

As the commission considers options for redistricting, the second step to promoting consensus is to ensure that the options for a new congressional district map are based on facts and data from the census and input from the public hearings.  

Armed with consensus on our responsibilities, equal access and understanding of the data, and education from the feedback from the public hearings; the committee will then be on a strong foundation for aligning on a congressional map that best servers Colorado.

I believe this approach will achieve consensus among the commissioners, makes the commissions’ work as fair and impartial as possible, and creates a map that is justified by facts, and not rhetoric or political whims.","I grew up in a politically active family in a small agricultural town in northern Montana.  During college, I received and political science internship with the Montana State Senate, where I supported the efforts of numerous republican senators.

Masters of Public Policy, University of Michigan","I have a life long interest in government, public policy and politics.  As you can see from my resume I studied Political Science as an under graduated and received my masters degree in Public Policy.  In my first career I pursued these interests by working for a member of the US House of Representatives (William Ford, MI) and then by working on political campaigns for US House, State Senate and Governor.   
I was fortunate to work for a US House member during redistricting after the 1990 Census and witnessed first hand some of the inner workings of this process as well as seeing how critical district boundaries were in shaping the composition of future governments and ultimately influencing future public policy.    As a graduate student in Public Policy I was able to take a seminar on apportionment and redistricting and learn of some of the academic work around these subjects and some early proposals by academics to limit some of the partisan influences from the process (my favorite from the time was proposal that representatives from each political party would take turns drawing a single district boundary line on a redistricting map – the theory being that by forcing them to alternate turns each side would reduce the ability of either side to maximize the boundaries to their advantage).
I, like many of our fellow citizens (as demonstrated by the passage of the redistricting commission ballot initiative) have become concerned over the increasing bitterness in partisan politics over the last decade.  While I have strong opinions and beliefs over what is “good” policy and advocate for those positions (and the candidates who support them), I also recognize that others hold just as strongly held beliefs that differ sharply from my own.  As we have grown more polarized I have worried that our governing institutions have struggled to perform in ways that serve our common good.  I have come to agree with the position that a significant contributing factor to this polarization has been the process used to draw district boundaries for state and federal elections.  With the massive increase in availability of detailed data about the electorate (by every conceivable dimensions – age, gender, party affiliation, race, ethnicity, income, education, ……) combined the geospacial computing technology available to use this data, we really had reached the point where the party in power during redistricting can maximize their partisan advantages in unprecedented ways. While Colorado’s previous process what not nearly as bad as other states, it still led to may inequities in district boundaries that contributed to this problem.  
The creation of politically motivated boundaries lines resulted in far too many uncompetitive districts where one political party was almost assured of election. The only competitive elections in these districts where in primary elections, which often resulted in the election of candidates that take the most extreme partisan positions.
It is my strong hope that through the new redistricting commission Colorado will draw election boundaries that will result in as many competitive seats as possible, thus improving the opportunity for candidates who will have motivation to seek out solutions that represent that views of  citizens from across the political spectrum.",See answer below on how I will promote consensus,N/A - until I retired this past year I traveled around the country for work and did not have time to participate in volunteer organizations,"In my career as a health care consultant I specialized in the use of data and analytics to drive strategy development and implementation.  I was privileged to work for some of the pioneering healthcare information companies (HCIA, Sachs Group, MedStat – which were eventually purchased by IBM Watson Healthcare) and develop a strong set of technical and analytical skills to use information to drive decision making.  At IBM I led a group of PhD data scientist, health care analysts and consultants to develop data driven solutions to some of the most challenging problems in the business of healthcare.  In this role we used the same type of data (demographical, education, income, location….) and geospacial technology that are used for redistricting.   I was responsible for leading and challenging this team to turn “data” and “analytics” into actionable information and insights to drive decision making processes.  Through this work I believe I have a strong foundation in the technology, analytics and logic required to develop districts that meet the criteria for determining congressional districts.","Prior to my retirement this past year I worked as a Strategy and Business Development consultant in the Health Care sector.  I this role I would often be hired by large health care systems to work across their organizations - with Board Members, Executives, Physicians, Front Line staff, Community members….

In this role I would have to facilitate a process to bring diverse constituencies to a consensus on a common set of goals.  At the same time I was also responsible for providing my own inputs into this process – advising senior leaders on strategic options based on my industry observations and expertise.  I believe my years of professional experience in strategy and facilitation combined with my passionate believe in the objectives of the redistricting commission will allow me to contribute to a commission that would be able to arrive at a consensus for the good of the citizens of Colorado and not for any individual position or faction.","Early in my career I worked for a member of the U.S. Congress (William Ford, D - Michigan) as well as worked on campaigns for candidates for  for U.S. Congressional, State of Michigan Senate and State of Michigan Governor;

With each trouble call–I had to start by finding out what was really needed or what was really going wrong.  Then, I had to apply a good deal of reasoning/logic and computer knowledge–to find a solution. And last, I needed to explain the problem (as well as possible) to the user and tell them “what to do next time”.      

b. I’ve been a volunteer Colorado Master Gardener in Otero county–from 2007 to the present.  Most of my gardening trouble calls need my on-site investigation–gardening knowledge--research–and then reasoning--to determine (1) what the gardener’s/plant’s problem is and (2) how to resolve or deal with the problem.  

c. I am a volunteer raptor monitor at John Martin Reservoir State Park (2006 to the present). (Raptors are predator birds–such as hawks, eagles, harriers, etc.).  At the state park, I first locate  raptors. Then I use my observation skills--knowledge about raptor plumage, behaviors, and migration habits–and my logic/reasoning--to determine the actual species, I’ve found.  (I report the numbers & species to Colorado Parks & Wildlife.  They use this data to keep track of the welfare--of the state park’s wildlife.) 
						
d. One of my hobbies is genealogy: Genealogy takes a surprising amount of logic/reasoning. For example, how do I tell, if I’ve found the same ancestor--in two (or more) different records?  I need to judge dates–locations–the spelling of names & places–handwriting–handwriting, in a non-English language--other records, in a document–family stories, etc. Sometimes the records do not match up. Then I must use my reasoning–knowledge of history–and knowledge of genealogy–to make a best guess.","a. As to promoting consensus: When faced with disagreeing persons–I try to find & propose different points of view–or present other possible solutions.  
For example, I was placed on a Jefferson county jury in July 1998 (a child neglect case)–and somehow elected chairman of the jury.  At first, two or three, of the jurors--went on and on–“psychoanalyzing” and blaming the mother, for everything.  I realized--that line of debate would get us nowhere–because, you can’t get inside anybody else’s head.  So I suggested that we concentrate only on the actual physical evidence–i.e. what had been presented in court, and what had happened to the children.  That seemed to concentrate everyone’s thinking.  The jury was able to reached an agreement--and return to court--in a surprising amount of time. 

b. As to being fair or impartial: As an employee, I was recruited (occasionally), to go thru job applications or to join applicant interviews.  The applications & interviews contained all sorts of inputs–a variety negative remarks--bad grammar & spelling–”don’t care” attitudes–and political statements.  I found that I needed to “wall off” the negative & extraneous inputs. Responsibilities, experience, genuine qualifications, & awards are (hopefully) left. Then, I could make reasonable choices.","1.

I have extensive experience in stakeholder engagement, consensus building, and legislative policy development regarding local, regional and state areas of concern. Several outcomes of my work in community organization are: 1. The development and creation of the widely supported Town of Mancos' 2011 Comprehensive Plan, which involved research and trend analysis, opinion surveys, personal interviews, and multiple visioning workshops; and 2. The formation of the Rico Downtown Development Authority, which involved in-depth market analysis, stakeholder engagement, conducting a blight study, drafting enabling legislation and bylaws, and assisting the clerk with coordinating a special election.

I've gained education and experience while holding elected, appointed, and executive offices in municipal governments in the Four Corners and Western Slope, including Ophir Town Manager, Palisade Community Development Director, Cortez Planning and Zoning Commission Chairperson, and Rico Town Board of Trustees Mayor Protem. I also represented colleagues as the elected NW Regional Representative for the Colorado Chapter of the American Planning Association's Board of Directors.

Although consensus can be difficult, it is an important goal to strive for, particularly when serving on a committee with widely differing viewpoints and competing interests. Establishing a unifying vision and agreeing upon a set of common values is a critical first step in guiding the work of diverse commissions. I will do my part to help the commission in reaching its vision of consensus. I will humbly show respect to everyone working on and with the commission, and abide by the agreed-upon values and norms set by the group to ensure that we work positively together to reach consent.

Following an ordered process for fair and impartial decision making is essential in upholding the legality of any final decision made by a legislative or quasi judicial committee. I will work diligently and collaboratively with the other committee members to develop clearly stated findings-of-fact that are based upon the established conditions for approval for redefining district boundaries. And I will strictly abide by any and all rules and codes of ethics governing public bodies, including abstaining from ex-parte communications prior to a scheduled public hearing and limiting  the acceptance of gifts.","I have never actively participated in an election campaign.

I also have the experiences of being reared on the Western Slope, with rural values, and having lived in a more liberal Larimer County for a long time. I have a college degree in word-smithing, six years as a newspaper reporter-editor, and several years as a basketball referee and softball umpire. And I have volunteered many years in the actual election process.","I credit my 8 years in 4-H (Montezuma Co.) for grounding me in citizenship, as well as all of the above. It was there where I learned to participate and run meetings, organize activities, and tutor younger members. That training has led to many other lifetime leadership opportunities in my community.  I have served as local chapter president and treasurer for the international PEO Sisterhood, helping young women pursue post-secondary education. In the Hand to Hand group, I've primarily provided money for specific young mothers trying to leave domestic abuse situations. I was elected president and treasurer for the Mariana Butte Ladies Golf Association, guiding its ongoing development and organization into two divisions, one for nine-hole players and one for 18's. I served a couple years on the city golf advisory board, representing women golfers in Loveland. Since my children entered a parent-established/run preschool, I've been involved in supporting and fundraising for their schools, always serving a couple years, or so, as president for the parent-teacher groups. One year, I organized a group of six elementary schools to order and fund two, big canvas teepees, to enhance third- and fourth-grade history education. In public schools, I was also involved with the accountability groups, particularly for the middle school and high school. For 8 years, I served on the district accountability committee, where we oversaw the details of local education efforts. During the last 2 years, I video-recorded all of the boys soccer matches for my grandson's high school team, editing huge files of video and getting the ""film"" to their coaches. As a result, our home has become a popular hang-out (and cafe) for teen-aged boys (and a few girls!). Lastly, I mention my work with seniors, usually much older than I. For 7 years, I led a Bible study at Courtyard Assisted Living, Loveland, where every Monday afternoon, I ""served up"" solid teaching for 7-10 regular attendees. As I was to lose my parents during that time, it gave me valuable understanding of the challenges and rewards of being a senior citizen. In this time of coronavirus, I've started a visiting group of P.E.O. members who can bring our chairs and masks to a local park, on Monday mornings, and socially distance ourselves for some much-need human connections!","I have been a 27-year member and leader in a local chapter of the international PEO Sisterhood, supporting women in education; a 10-year with the local Hand to Hand group, which raises money for Alternatives to Violence (domestic abuse); a 27-year member of the Mariana Butte Ladies Golf Association; a couple years on the city golf advisory board; many years in parent-teacher groups at Community Preschool and 2 elementary schools; several years on the school accountability groups at elementary, middle, and high schools and Thompson R2-J District level (8 years); years in the Larimer County Democratic Party; and my church, Resurrection Fellowship.","Read any printed information ahead of meetings, listen first, analyze additional printed information, and then formulate positions. Competent staff will be very important, because we will need lots of dependable statistics to present rational arguments for our approaches and choices. A capable, respected chairperson will be extremely important, particularly to guide respectful discussion. Sometimes, reason and statistics are not enough; we may have to consider human elements, such as how far people will need to travel or cultural issues.","Fairness and impartiality are integral, so Colorado voters will trust the commission's work. I am a trained umpire who applies rules to a softball game, with fairness as the underlying principle. The commission needs some of us well-grounded, practical people to balance the lawyers and political scientists.

Now the citizens of the state have made concrete efforts to move the redistricting process out of politics and government (per se.)  I believe individuals such as myself should volunteer to take the experience, training, and leadership learned over years of making people and systems work correctly and put those skills to use making the redistricting work for the citizens, not the politicized governmental establishment.  All Colorado citizens deserve to have themselves and their neighbors properly represented in our fantastic democratic republic.  Colorado is diverse from many different perspectives - some rural some urban, some mountains - some plains, some agriculture - some energy, some business – some labor, etc.  The list goes on.  Each perspective deserves the ability to express its collective, and sometimes unique, needs, desires, & contributions, via both the federal and state representations.

Who wouldn’t want to be part of that?","In addition to the GOP County Central Committee above, I have been active in the non-profit Rocky Mountain Wing (RMW) Commemorative Air Force (CAF) serving on the Wing Staff as both Education Officer and as the Wing Newsletter Editor.  Accomplishments include implementing the CAF Rise Above program that has enabled 1,000's of Colorado Westen Slope middle school students to be exposed to and experience the dedication and determination put forth by our Greatest Generation during WWII.  I also successfully campaigned to have the Wing's Grumman TBM Avenger Torpedo Bomber certified as both a Colorado State Historical Object and a National Historic Object (airplane), one of only two that regularly continue to fly.  

Even though somewhat inactive over the past few months, over several years I have written for and maintained a small blog where I've posted many, many letters I've written to Congressmen, Senators, and state officials regarding issues current at the time.

I never considered flying these aircraft a ""profession"" but rather a diversion to hone both my mental skills as well as improve and maintain my piloting skills.  

Without question, piloting today's aircraft in ""the crowded skies"" requires logic and reasoning skills above the norm.  

Most piloting (with perhaps the exception of crop dusting)can be hours of boredom interspersed with moments of terror!  Those moments of terror require logic and reasoning skills way beyond those necessary to put together a contract for a worldwide computer packet switching network.  Operating within one environment compliments the other - I speak from experience in both cases.

Gathering known reliable and meaningful data, using demonstrated means to analyze the data for information pertinent to the problem at hand, applying the information in acceptable means, and then making sound decisions based on the data - not other outside emotionally charged input -  is the path to success - both in the cockpit and the boardroom.  That same logic and decision path will serve the redistricting commission, and Colorado's diverse citizenship very well.","I spent my entire professional career negotiating - establishing consensus between groups and individuals.

I believe that every person running for office owes the voters a clear explanation of why they should be elected or re-elected.  That means creating districts that are competitive or more nearly competitive.  I think that is what the voters of Colorado voted for and why the commission exists.  I also very strongly believe in the power of cognitive diversity.  Challenges are overcome by leveraging the power of the different ways in which different people see the world, solve problems and make predictions.  Cognitive diversity is not the same as identity diversity (diversity based on race, gender, etc.), but it does correlate with it.  The challenge is to actually put cognitive diversity to work.  That's hard.  I've tried and both failed and succeeded as a VP with Boeing and with my own LLC here in Colorado.  It takes positive leadership to most effectively address problems and challenges, not directive-ship.  For example, extroverts are important to a good team (as important as introverts), but one extrovert, uncontrolled, can destroy the cognitive strength of a team.  I want to serve because I've spent well over a decade learning and understanding cognitive diversity and over fifty years as a leader, both in government and industry.  I want to help bring cognitive diversity to the challenge and to help leverage the diversity of the team.  I can be equally effective as a team member or as a team leader.","As a member of various Lafayette, Colorado, boards, committees and Councils, I have actively represented the interests of, those people that I consider pragmatists.  I take the position that it is all well and good to support lofty goals, but it is more important to support those goals that are actually achievable.  I have found that a common human failing is committing to some initiative without considering how the people involved in or affected by the initiative will actually respond to that initiative.  Human beings behave in ways that satisfy their personal goals and well being - not the ways in which councils, commissions, boards and legislatures want them to behave.  I participate in boards and commissions by encouraging my colleagues to engage in thorough discussions of the basic goal and how to achieve that goal. I don't believe in attacking or challenging the ideas of others, but I do believe in asking “why” and “how” questions to get to the very root of the idea and the potential ramifications and consequences of implementing it.  Why do we want to say/do that?  Does saying that commit us to some course of action?  If so, what?  How will we achieve such and such goal?  What are the measures that will help us understand whether or not we're making progress toward the goal?  What is the benefit to the citizens?  People are reasonable when they take the time to approach a task cognitively vs. intuitively   I believe that I am aligned with intent of the recent ballot initiative to re-draw Colorado’s legislative districts.  In redrawing Colorado’s legislative districts, it is vitally important to work from the basis that the goal is the creation of districts that are most fair to the voters in each of those districts – not to make the districts the same “size” or to ensure that they are homogeneous.  Competitive districts are fairer because candidates must actually engage voters and present their “platforms” and philosophies of government and allow the voters to choose.","Lafayette, CO Senior Advisory Board since 2018 Currently Vice Chairman

The trick, of course is to separate the facts from the junk.  As an engineer and a flight-test lead, it was imperative that I was able to conduct my own analysis and to understand the analyses of others.  That meant having a working knowledge of probability and statistics as well as an understanding of the limits of sampling and extrapolation.  It also means having an appreciation for the power of analytic theories like Bayesian probability.  While I'm certainly no expert in Bayesian probability (or statistics), I understand the concepts, can work with them, and understand (most importantly) their limitations.  

As the Boeing VP for Analysis, Modeling, Simulation and Experimentation, I led a global team of analysts and successfully applied analysis to successfully win new business.  I had to both understand the analysts and to explain their findings and recommendations to the most senior levels of the Boeing company.

I also understand from my study of behavioral economics that people are not machines and that people behave the ways in which people behave – not as some mythical monolithic bloc.","I have always strongly disliked the idea of consensus -- consensus is the answer that everyone can live with, and that's usually the “least bad” solution.  What we need to do is take ideas and proposals and leverage the cognitive diversity of the commission to build the best possible solution through a virtuous spiral of improvement.  Sounds like buzzwordism, but it isn't.  By listening to everyone's ideas AND understanding those ideas, it's not only possible but relatively painless to build good solutions.  A good redistricting solution is one under which candidates for office cannot rely on some ""base"" to get them elected, but one under which every candidate must go and listen to and understand his/her potential constituents.  They need to appreciate that they are interviewing for a job, not selling some preconceived ideas to the unwashed masses.

I'll promote the creation of agreement among the commissioners by actively listening to each commissioner's ideas and concerns, by asking questions to ensure that I do understand and then by working to leverage the best of each proposal to achieve the best possible solution rather than the “least bad” solution we can all live with.  Part of that is to help every commissioner understand the power of cognitive diversity and how the team can harness and use that diversity effectively.  

I believe that the best solutions are those that are arrived at through fact-supported processes of discussing and overcoming challenges.  I recognize that I, like all humans, am subject to biases -- biases that, once recognized, can be overcome.  Since the best solutions are achieved through the active participation of a cognitively diverse group, it is absolutely mandatory that the inputs and ideas of all members of the group be seriously considered, incorporating them when those inputs and ideas will improve the outcome.  To my mind, the outcome, in this case, should ensure that competitive voting districts will make it necessary for candidates to engage the voters and propose solid, logical platforms.  That can only be accomplished in an impartial manner.  Pushing a pre-conceived agenda on the populous is the antithesis of achieving the best outcome.","I have engaged in no political activity since November 10, 2015",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/160

For 46 years, my introductory graduate course in public service and public affairs began by teaching and modeling the “rules of civic engagement.” In a culture heavily influenced by rant-radio talk show hosts and ideologically charged political sound bites, people typically get little training on how to discuss policy issues on which they disagree deeply. This makes democracy less functional.

Groups are more effective when they follow the rules of civic engagement, which are:
•	No matter how much you disagree with someone, be more concerned with learning what they believe and why than with explaining or defending your own viewpoint.
•	No matter how illogical or uninformed they seem to be, do not shout them down, call them names, or tune them out by stereotyping them in your own mind.
•	If you have trouble with these two rules, repeat this mantra silently as you listen: “Is it possible that under any circumstances, some part of what they say might conceivably be true?” Repeat until they finish and ask you what you think.
•	If this mantra gives you trouble, do it while breathing through your nose, not your mouth.

After a few weeks of modeling, students unconsciously begin to use these rules themselves. The class transforms itself from a theater for eloquent bullies into an arena for civic engagement by a group of reflective, intelligent adults. Shouting, name-calling, and derogatory asides die out. Speakers get better at stating their views succinctly and supporting them effectively with expert opinions, personal experiences, data, and logic. Classmates turn toward the speaker, listen more closely, and interrupt less. They address questions and comments to each other by name. Little by little, as the dominant ones listen more and talk less, the quieter ones creep into the newly cleared conversational space. Soon, no one misses class except for work or family emergencies. This is how we learn together.

The principles of civic engagement transform lives and strengthen democracy.

Today's politics have become so divisive -- and I think one of the main reasons is the 'cheating' of gerrymandered districts -- so we need to remove the conflict and actually listen to each other and think about the greater good. There are so many fronts where we need to address campaign reform (i.e. fundraising, unlimited spending by outside groups, etc.) but I believe that setting fair and representative districts is an important first step to creating a better campaign/election system.

I believe that our Colorado representatives should represent constituents of similar local concerns and not be far removed from many constituents located in the far reaches of a gerrymandered district.  For instance, the current CD6 map extends from Brighton to Centennial, CD 2 goes from the northern border to the southern tip of Jefferson County, and CD3 extends from Pueblo to Moffat counties.  I think we can do better. I think we can make fairer districts.  Colorado is a purple state that has had a tilt to either blue or red depending on the election in the last 25 years.  In most years, we should expect Colorado's 7 congressional districts to have a 4-3 split of major parties serving in the US House. In years, with significant sea changes or ""waves"" of one party preference, the split should be no more than 5-2.

After the Stem High School shooting, our church decided we should investigate how to reduce isolation and help build a more resilient society beyond the church.  A “Wellness Committee” was formed and the focus was narrowed the to young adults between ages 14 and18.  I was elected to chair the subgroup focusing on developing resilience in the 16-18 year olds.  To determine what mental health issues our target population were facing, I suggested that we add members to our advisory group who were in the 16-18 year old target age range.  We then consulted with private therapists, community mental health programs, Arapahoe/Douglas County Mental health consortium, researched the literature, and searched to find what services were already being offered to address those issues.  The Wellness Committee then made recommendations to the church.  While the Corona Virus has delayed an implementation of these recommendations, preliminary efforts are being made to establish an independent nonprofit organization to implement these suggestions to provide preventive services so that the mental health issues do not develop in the first place.

The most relevant example however, was when I was on the Interim Planning Group for the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services and I chaired a potentially contentious public hearing.  I was told that a group that was upset with HRS might attempt to disrupt the meeting.  I began the meeting by explaining the purpose of the meeting, and laying the ground rules that we would only be discussing issues related to the stated purpose of the meeting.  If people had other issues they would like to discuss, HRS staff would be available at the back of the room to discuss their issues in private.  When the first member of their group began to speak about their grievances, I politely asked if their comments were related to the topic of the meeting.  They agreed that they were not, and I suggested that they discuss their concerns with the HRS staff member at the back of the room.  This process continued through a third person from their group, after which their group no longer attempted to disrupt the meeting.  As I was leaving the meeting, by chance, I met the leader of the group in the elevator, and he apologized for his group’s behavior.  I was able to develop a solution where his group felt heard, but which did not disrupt the intended purpose of the meeting.  So often people who disrupt public meetings are doing so because they do not feel heard, and know of no other way to express their grievances.","•	St Andrew United Methodist Church,

We represented a wide variety of mental health professionals in private practice, including psychologists, mental health counselors, social workers, and marriage and family therapists, each with competing interests.  I called a board retreat to discuss what interests we had in common, and what services we could offer our members that they did not get from other organizations.  The previous President thought this would be a waste of time, but I convinced her to attend.  We looked at what we were currently offering, what other organizations were offering, and what needs weren’t being met, and decided to focus on private practice needs.  As a result, our membership rapidly increased.

As an individual investor, I have been highly successful in applying logic and reason to find promising stocks, analyzing their prospects for long term growth, and assessing obstacles and trends to obtain success.  While I pay attention to several newsletters to narrow the field of stocks to investigate, those newsletters may have biases or may discount important information which I find from other sources.  That is not to say that the stock market is always logical in the short run, or that my analysis is always correct.  But my performance beats the forecasts of many professional financial analyst’s.","In my book, Don’t Carve the Turkey with a Chainsaw: Resolving Family Conflict, I discuss how “conflict is not based on reality, but on people’s interpretations of that reality.”  To understand the other person’s interpretation of reality you must listen.  However, most people only listen to the other person’s reality 1% of the time, and when they do listen, it is to attend to information that confirms their own position and discounts contrasting information.  When you are more concerned with what YOU are saying than hearing what the other person has to say, you listen only long enough to defend your own position, or find flaws in your partner’s logic.  They do likewise, and the more they defend their position, the more they believe their own propaganda.

So, what is the best way to promote consensus?
1. First present our facts and our interpretation of the facts, giving reasons. 
2. Understand the other person’s thinking using sincere questioning and listening. Good listening involves detective work that helps uncover not only the content being expressed, but also the feelings, values, motivation, and interpretations behind the content. 
3. Focus on interests, not positions. Positions are the solutions you generate to solve a problem.  Interests are the underlying reasons influencing the decision.  It is frequently much easier to develop consensus about interests than positions. Frequently, a solution can be developed that addresses common interests, and develops a position neither party had previously considered. 
4. Brainstorm win/win solutions that focus on the future, then select the best options.  When we focus on what we want to happen in the future, rather than focusing on past misdeeds, we can avoid blaming, and the defensiveness that comes with it. 
5. Implement the solution.  
6. Evaluate the outcome using independent measures.

All this requires that the people we are dealing with feel safe, knowing that they will not be attacked, or humiliated.  Judgmental comments, insults, blaming, interrupting, interrogating questioning, all-or-nothing statements, and dishonesty all annihilate safety. “Respect is like air.  If you take it away, it’s all people can think about.  The instant people perceive disrespect in a conversation, the interaction is no longer about the original purpose—it is now about defending dignity.”

I believe my ability to be fair and impartial has been demonstrated in leadership roles where I have received considerable respect as documented by the provided letters of recommendation, and experiences.

I want to be active in crafting solutions that benefit Colorado voters statewide. I consider myself a life-long learner, a good listener, a team worker and a fair person.","My experience in organizing, representing and advocating for groups is centered on education and literacy. As a veteran teacher I had experience with organizations such as Close Up, The Educational Testing Service, The Colorado Council for Economic Education, The Colorado Geographic Alliance (COGA), and teaching Advanced Placement U.S. History, World Geography, European History and World History. I have been a reader/scorer for the College Board for over fifteen years. I have served as a reader/evaluator for the Children’s Book Council, participating on committees for the Notable Social Studies Award and the Carter G. Woodson Award. For years I have served as a local judge for the National History Day competition.","Independent Voter, I was a member of the Denver Classroom Teachers Association prior to my retirement in 2016. A member of the Colorado Geographic Alliance and the American Library Association.","In achieving my Masters in Library and Information Science from the University of Denver in 2007 I had many opportunities to apply sophisticated analysis to situations and scenarios presented as part of my course work and in my subsequent employment as a librarian. 
From developing authentic collections and embracing the needs of diverse patrons to budget considerations within unique tax districts, the focus on analyzing data enabled me to chart a clear path for providing relevant and productive library service for all.

My ability to apply logic and reason to a problem is perhaps best illustrated by my work as a reader for the College Board’s Advanced Placement United States History exam. 
As a reader, our job is to read and score (according to a pre-set rubric) student’s essays answering one topic question during a seven day session that begins each day at 8am and ends at 5pm. The same question over and over, but answered by high school students from all over the country (as well as those attending international schools). We each read hundreds of essays daily by students whose skill sets vary wildly. 
Our goal as readers is to award the students for what they know – not punish them for what they omit or get wrong. Many times logic dictates that the student answered the prompt correctly, looking at their writing holistically, and even though there might be minor errors in their writing. Reason takes that logic by the hand and reminds us as readers that the student wrote the essay in 45 minutes, under extreme pressure and without prior knowledge of the prompt. 
So when we spend the two to three minutes reading and scoring each essay we embrace that reason and logic and our goal to benefit the student’s effort is realized.","I will promote consensus by being patient in listening to all points of view expressed and by maintaining flexibility in my own opinions. I believe my career as a public school teacher has helped shape my skills in this regard. High School students share their thoughts and opinions about absolutely everything. An integral part of being a good teacher is listening to what they have to say without verbal or visual signs of judgement, and then working towards an answer, resolution or consideration. 
This skill was, and is, often tested when what is said clashes with my own ideas or realities. That is where the work gets more difficult and can be more rewarding. 
Often in committee meetings, parent conferences, as well as mentoring new teachers, the same patience and honest listening is needed. 
Especially in these challenging times, I have no doubt that building agreement with any diverse group of people will be difficult. I believe with my personal history and experience I am up to the task.","My past political activity has mostly involved teaching my high school Social Studies students about local, state, national government, civic participation and the U.S. Constitution. When applicable, I have encourage my senior students to register to vote. In line with district policy, I have always presented a non-partisan view in my teaching as well as in my professional profile. 
As a registered Independent voter I have been fortunate and honest in regarding the issues behind ballot measures and candidates, as opposed to being influenced along party lines.
I vote given every opportunity not only because it is a privilege to do so, but also because I am answerable to my students as a person of responsibility and leadership.
I have not consciously donated money to any political campaign or organization. I was a member of the teacher’s union DCTA and I withheld monies from them that were being directed politically.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/521

In my college years, I worked on civil rights issues.  My support of women's  equality and women's reproductive rights is demonstrated by my involvement in the effort to pass The Equal Rights Amendment and serve on the Board of Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood.  To promote women's full participation in Colorado, I was the Executive Director of The Women's Foundation of Colorado and served on the Board of the Women's Bean Project - both organizations serving low-income women on their path to self-sufficiency.

My service on the staffs of a governor, a member of the U.S. House, U.S. Senate and two presidents gave me a chance to make the lives of all Coloradans better - everyday if I did my job well, I helped open doors to services provided by my government.

As a reluctant retiree, I have volunteered at the Library to ensure that ""The People's University"" is open to all and able to provide services and materials to enrich its patrons' lives.  I have organized volunteers to elect political candidates.  I have gone door to door canvasing.  I have given classes helping people better understand both sides of the issues on the Colorado ballot.

To support a greater voice for citizens in national politics, I served on the Board of Colorado Common Cause and became the first straight person on the Colorado Human Rights Campaign Board - seeking equality for the LBGTQ community,  and I was honored to be the first Anglo on the Latino Community Foundation of Colorado's Board, recognizing the growing and vibrant Hispanic population throughout the state and helping to meet their needs.

My life has been richly textured by these experiences and serving on the commission will give me a chance to help shape a dynamic, fair and unbiased division of the state's population into congressional districts that will well represent us in the decade ahead. As a senior member of Congressman David Skaggs' staff in 1991, I got first hand knowledge of the process as the district was being reconfigured and the decisions affected the constituents and the Congressman.","2016-2019:       Board Member, Friends of Chamber Music, Denver, CO

Certificate in Medical Interpreting.,"Ever since I researched the subject of redistricting and read a book about it, I became aware how important it is that every American’s vote is counted. I have found that one way to disenfranchise a voter’s right to be equally represented is through the unfair drawing of lines along the districts on a map. Example: if you have knowledge of where the minority population resides on a map and you want to keep them from winning the election, you can exert your power by redrawing the lines in a way to keep the minority from winning an election, thereby disenfranchising their right to have their voice heard.

This is what drives me to serve on the commission.  I am a Navajo Indian; I am unique and come from a population that is underserved and underrepresented.  I believe that my input from a diverse perspective is valuable because I would like to make sure people of my race and other minority population have an equal voice through fair mapping.   

My experiences in the community as Vice President of Morgan County Democrats and my background of volunteer work only enhance my drive to serve to make a difference as a member of the redistricting commission.","I can think of a lot of things as an answer to this question, but I would like to focus on my experience advocating, organizing and representing, as a member and acting as the Vice-Chairman of Morgan County Democrats in Colorado. 

When I moved to Fort Morgan, Colorado a few years ago, I found that the Democratic Party was a minority in the community.  Most residents of Fort Morgan belonged to the Republican Party.  As a result, the Democrats felt oppressed. As a leader, I found that this made it difficult for me to get things done.  

Just to place a sign out in the street was risky for fear that the signs would be vandalized. And it did happen. The signs that we placed on the street were immediately vandalized several times.  

Few people wanted to work with us because we were Democrats.  It was difficult to just locate a venue to host an event in the community.  To rent an office to hold our monthly meeting was an enormous task because organizations refused to rent to us.  

Organizing a float in the 4th of July in order to be visible in the community was unheard of.  Few members of the Morgan County Democrats wanted to even ride in the parade for fear of not only ridicule, but the possible physical harm that may come to them. Few wanted to take these risks. The first time we constructed a float, decorated it with huge banners with huge letters of MORGAN COUNTY DEMOCRATS and rode on it in the 4th of July parade, some people ran out in the streets and threw objects at us. Children sprayed water directly on us. But we survived it.  Those people in the audience, who had secretly claimed to be Democrats, were initially apprehensive to cheer and clap for us.  But I noticed that they slowly came around over the years. Each year they saw our Party in the parade, more of them came out to cheer, voicing their appreciation.  

Losing a job was a concern for the members of our organization. They did not want to deal with the repercussions of being revealed that they supported the Democratic Party at their workplace.  I experienced this myself.  I kept a low profile at work.  In this way I identified with the members’ oppressed feelings.  Some must have lost their jobs before I came on the scene.  

Election time seemed to be a stressful time.  Door-knocking was an insurmountable task. No one dared to knock on doors the first year I came to Fort Morgan.   I personally, alone, had to go knock on doors to get the vote out.  Gradually over the years, I got a few more people to muster enough courage to knock on doors with me.  What helped were the stories I wrote up about my experiences knocking on doors and I emailed these to the members of the Democratic Party in the county.  Slowly, more and more people became willing to knock on doors with me. 

With this backdrop of the circumstances, I felt that I had to advocate for who I am and on behalf of my party, not only to the community of Fort Morgan, but to the members themselves in the monthly meetings.  There was tremendous discrimination and prejudice against the Democrats in Morgan County. Everything that we valued as a party, like gay rights, women’s right to choose, immigration rights, labor rights, environmental protection values, was held against us.  

Therefore, it took a lot of courage, determination, persistence, and the energy to change the minds of the people.  This I experienced while I organized and represented the Democrats and advocated for them in their community as well as within their own party.","Throughout the summer of 2020, I volunteered by phone and internet for the Navajo Hopi Covid-19 Relief Fund, reaching out to those native people who were affected by Coronavirus. Many lived in the remote areas of the Navajo and Hopi reservations without running water or electricity. A toll-free telephone number was set up where members of their families could call and reach a virtual volunteer, like myself, who took a list of needs like food, water, medical, transportation and cleaning supplies and passed this list on to the ground volunteers who supplied these needs. This was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.  

Since 2015, I have also volunteered for other events like the Thanksgiving dinner for the homeless at the Rise Up Center through the Community of Christ church.

I have participated in the weekly bible study through the Lutheran Church of Our Redeemer.
I have also participated in a different bi-weekly men’s bible study in the Fort Morgan community which included various religious groups.

When a borrower comes to me for financing, I am required to use all these skills to determine if the borrower will be capable of repaying the money he hopes to obtain.  As the loan officer or mortgage broker, I am the first gatekeeper towards the borrower’s path to obtaining a loan. After analyzing the borrower’s liabilities and assets, I have a duty to make a wise judgment as to whether the loan will close.  This involves gathering data to reveal the picture of the borrower.  I am obligated to input the data accurately into my calculations and verify that the borrower has sufficient income, stable job history, and sufficient reserves to sustain the monthly payment.  I have to determine whether the borrower has the appropriate debt ratio, which is the amount of debt analyzed against the income.  Investigating, verifying, and checking for accuracy are all part of forming the true picture of the borrower. If there are blemishes in the credit history of the borrower, I have the responsibility to determine how the negative credit will impact the borrower’s ability to repay the loan.  Here, my ability to communicate is essential; I am required to draw the information from the borrower to determine if the bad credit is due to consistent negligence or a one-time event that was beyond the control of the borrower. 

When the case is extremely difficult, I am forced to collaborate with my fellow-loan officers and supervisor to see if the deal is too risky or if we can creatively do the financing. An example is if the property falls within a fine-line definition of real property. Real property is one that is affixed to land.  As a mortgage lender, the only properties I can finance are those that fall within this definition of real property. A questionable type of this property is a modular home which used to be a movable property but has since been transformed into a property that would be attached to land. The investors who ultimately put up the money to finance the deal may bring up this question at the last minute of closing and the property could be rejected. A good loan officer has this foresight and avoids this probability beforehand.  

Being at the forefront where everything hinges on how well I reveal the true picture of the borrower is the essential part of whether the investor will profit or lose money on the deal of financing a borrower’s request.  How well I have used my analytical skills and how well I have applied my logic and reasoning to solve the initial problems involved in approving a loan will determine the end result of the investment.","As president of a Native American organization, I had a rare opportunity to lead a people that came from two diverse religious beliefs.  One group was of the Christian faith and this group consisted of urban Indians coming from the city lifestyle.  The other group was of the traditional Native American religion which came in from the reservation areas.   I was tempted to cater to one group which had similar beliefs to mine.  But I had to overlook my established way of thinking and become empathetic to those who believed differently than me.  I also noticed that it was easy for one group to turn against the other because they felt, albeit unsubstantiated, there was favoritism demonstrated against them. An example of the diverse of beliefs was how they felt about gay members of the group.  The Christians did not feel that assistance should easily be given to the gay members of the group while the traditional natives had more compassion and respect for the gay members. Though it was a challenge, I had to be fair and impartial. I brought these groups together by promoting consensus by first allowing the members to introduce themselves and to share something unique about themselves.  An important characteristic about the gay members was that they were very artistic.  Most had a talent to perform or to decorate.  This came in very handy when we decided to build a float for an annual parade that had a historical significance to the Native American community.  Our float was featured on television because we brought Native American dancers together to perform on the float.  The Native American motif and design was unique and outstanding.  What resulted from this event was the new respect the gay members gained.  There was a better understanding between the groups and a respect for their diverse uniqueness of the members.  The conservative group became more empathetic to the gay group as well as the traditional native group.  They all started to get along and a much better cohesiveness was created.  As a result, the ability to collaborate on new projects were more easily achieved.

From experiences like this, I feel that I can contribute to the redistricting commission by listening to the different perspectives and points of view, thereby be impartial and  promote consensus among the commissioners.","Most of my past political activity has been with the Morgan County Democratic Party.  I led the way to knocking on doors for the Hillary Clinton campaign.  I made calls to voters.  I spent all day on election day contacting those voters who had not yet voted and following up on those who had not responded by visiting their homes in order to make sure that every voter had voted.  I would like to think that due to my efforts, I have contributed to the victory of Hillary Clinton in the state of Colorado.  

Before the Hillary Clinton elections, I helped Barack Obama win Colorado.  I was fortunate to win the Northeastern CO campaign for the volunteer who had gone the extra mile of knocking on doors and calling on voters.  The winner would have his picture taken with Vice President Joe Biden.  I was so excited to meet and pose in a photo with VP Joe Biden. 

I have been very active with the Morgan County Democratic Party ever since I came to Fort Morgan 14 years ago.  I volunteered to head committees to organize dinners, like our annual Big-Ten dinner, as well as the fall and Christmas dinners.  The task of organizing and planning involved a wide range of tasks.  We had to find a proper venue equipped with a kitchen and a facility to hold enough people for the event.  If the event was a potluck dinner, we had to make sure people brought enough food.   We had to come up with a theme and design an agenda.  We had to solicit help to decorate the venue and clean up the location.  Places that had no sound system was an extra task to find someone to provide a sound system.  Providing entertainment for the dinner involved the task of soliciting musical groups to perform at the event.  In order to run an event according to schedule, it was important to follow up with the speakers and presenters to make sure they had all the information they needed so they could arrive on time.  Finally, one of the most important part of organizing an event was to plan a fund-raising project, like an auction during the dinner, that would be lucrative for the Party. 

Community exposure was one of my objectives as a leader.  I wanted the public to know who we were and what we stood for.  I wanted to make the public feel welcome to our center.  With that in mind, I reached out by introducing myself and the Party whenever events came about in the community.  I made small presentations about our monthly meetings, our frequent get-togethers including dinners and parties and made the public feel at ease with us and helped them realize that we had a lot of positive things to offer.  

I donated $35 dollar every year for the Big-Ten dinners since 2015.  I also donated $30 each to 3 candidates since that time.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/1017

Especially with our ""first past the post"" system, dominated by two political parties, allowing voters the ability to pick their representatives (and not the other way around) is critical. I strongly believe that a large contributing factor to our current political extremes is due to parties controlling redistricting, almost guaranteeing their victory, which leads to politicians having to go further and further to extremes.

During my time at CDC, I was routinely called upon for special assignments – establishing high-profile programs, leading rapid decision-making units during pandemics, rescuing and rehabilitating programs decimated by political budget cuts.  After retirement, I committed to myself that I would use those skills and that passion to help find solutions in my own community and state, rather than just at the Federal government level.  

I have long been interested in Congressional processes. During my time at CDC, I had the privilege to meet regularly with members of Congress and their staffs to educate them about our programs and answer their questions.  I love the idea of democratic representation and finding ways to make that representation really work.  Spending the bulk of my career living in a state that was heavily gerrymandered (Georgia) was exceptionally frustrating and something I vowed to take seriously when I was free of the Hatch Act restrictions I was placed under as a Federal uniformed services officer.  

When I retired and moved to Colorado in 2016, I knew I was moving to a state with many fewer Congressional districts, and that the population size and distribution was the largest determinant of how those districts are structured. The degrees of freedom for creating districts are extremely limited because of this. But the issues facing voters in CO-3 – one of the largest geographical districts in the nation with a relatively small population – must be considered and forcefully advocated for during the redistricting analysis and decision-making.  I want to represent that perspective while also recognizing that the commission must make the best decisions for the good of the entire state.  I want to apply my analytic, strategic, and negotiation skills to this big, difficult challenge to help the commission succeed in its work.","Upon moving to Colorado, I became an active member of 4 volunteer music organizations – the Cowboy Corral, Symphony in the Valley, the Aspen Choral Society, and High Country Sinfonia. In each, my goal was to serve as an outstanding musical contributor. With Aspen Choral Society and High Country Sinfonia, I quickly became more deeply involved in the organizational and business aspects through appointments to the Boards of Directors.

I joined the Board of the Aspen Choral Society at a time when many important organizational changes were occurring. I quickly recognized that the Board would benefit from having the bylaws updated and a more aggressive public relations and fundraising posture.  I led the revision of the bylaws, facilitated the entire board in reviewing and discussing options for important changes, identified a volunteer to serve as our general counsel for review and advice, and assisted the Board President with socializing and approving the new bylaws among the full board. I also worked closely with a public relations contractor to develop press releases and a more active social media presence. Behind the scenes, I provide guidance to the Board President based on my previous experience and training as a member of a board for a large national organization. 

High Country Sinfonia appointed me to their Board in 2020 to assist with their efforts to become a registered non-profit organization in the state of Colorado. That work is ongoing and draws from my experience developing the bylaws and procedures for Aspen Choral Society.

My approach to organizing, representing, and advocating for both organizations is to serve the three “duties” of a board member – duty of care, duty of loyalty, and duty of obedience. My aim is to improve their business operations through careful shifts in policy and activity, while honoring the long local traditions of each organization and the deep relationships among and between the long-standing members, board members, and the community members who are our donors and audiences.

A second way I actively consider the interests of Colorado organizations is my professional consulting work in public health and strategic planning. I have worked with several governmental organizations or associated entities within Pitkin County including the Board of County Commissioners, the Department of Public Health, the Aspen Pitkin County Housing Authority, and the Pitkin County Elected Officials Transportation Committee (including the Pitkin BoCC, the Aspen City Council, and the Snowmass Village Town Council). In each engagement, I have strived to build rapport, guide the group to a strategic solution, and identify and resolve areas of disagreement all while adhering to the parameters provided by the sponsor/client.  This work has given me deep insight into the political structures, realities, and foibles of the government entities within one county and, critically, how those entities relate to their neighboring counties of the Roaring Fork Valley.","•	American College of Preventive Medicine (a 501c3 national professional medical society, member since 1996; Fellow since 2004; Board of Regents President-Elect 2017-2019, President 2019-2021, CEO Search/Selection Committee Chair 2018)

In approaching problems of all kinds, I first look to the available data, seek other sources of information, and apply the strategic negotiation and planning skills described above to best analyze, generate options, and solve a problem.","In my facilitation and strategic planning work, I use several techniques to promote consensus.  Chief among these is to ask questions to make sure I fully understand the perspective and contribution of the group members. I also make sure that I carefully draw out both the explicit and implicit criteria people are using to make decisions so that I can find areas where negotiation is possible.  I always try to understand my own and others’ self-interests.

I also work to reframe conflicts – what is it we already agree on?  How can we use those points of agreement to find solutions to meet the enlarged interests of the group – in this case the entire state?  When disagreement continues it is usually because the “right” solution has yet to be found. Being creative and drawing on the entire group’s creativity is key. And finally, I aim to always articulate how the group came to its recommendation or solution and what the criteria were. This contributes directly to communications that generate buy-in among stakeholders and so that each member of the commission can faithfully and enthusiastically promote the results of the work.

My training as a scientist, manager and leader and my experience in the highly politicized environment of Federal public health instilled in me the need for fairness and impartiality. One cannot lead a team without being fair. Serving as the steward of a Federal budget requires one to be impartial.  Federal procurement rules build fairness and impartiality directly into the systems within which I was trained. It is my instinct – through disposition and training – to make decisions based on facts, after considering the pros and cons of all the options, while making the decision criteria explicit, and with a deep understanding of how all stakeholders will feel about the decision.

Finally, the most important aspect of promoting consensus and contributing to a fair, impartial and agreeable process is getting to know and appreciate the perspectives of my fellow commissioners. Learning about each other – including who we are and what we value – will be key to the commission’s success.","During a 25-year career as a Federal uniformed services medical officer (1991-2016), my political activity was limited due to Hatch Act restrictions.  Following my retirement (September 1, 2016), I participated in house-to-house canvassing during the 2016 general election.  During the 2018 election, I did a small amount of letter writing for the Diane Mitsch Bush campaign (CO-3).  

During 2020, I have participated in the Eagle County Democratic Caucus and as a district/state delegate in March, served as an Eagle County citizen election judge during the June primary, and briefly volunteered for and participated in one meeting of the Eagle County Democrats this summer. Because of ongoing public health consulting work related to the pandemic, I have not been able to continue my volunteer activities at this time. As I wind down these consulting activities, I plan to serve as a citizen election judge again for the general election in November.

I like to compare it to solving word problems. I am a very logical thinker, which led to my successful career of 40 years in that industry.

I became interested in the redistricting process after stumbling across a monograph by Professor Robert Loevy who participated in the 2010 effort in Colorado.  That spurred me to read ""RatF**ked"" by David Daley.  Clearly, redistricting is a complex process involving multiple competing priorities.  That type of problem is one with which I have a great deal of expertise.  I have specialized expertise in data analysis and the design decision support systems.  My research is focused on problems involving temporal and geo-spatial uncertainty.  I believe I have a lot to offer the Colorado redistricting effort: I have the time, the interest, and the expertise.  I think I also have the right demeanor  -- I am an idealist but not a zealot.  When facing conflict, I seek out a solution having the most good for the most stakeholders.  In summary, I want to serve because I think I can add value to the process, and because I believe that a successful redistricting process in Colorado might serve as a positive model for our country.","As a faculty member at CSU, I deliberately avoided participation in special interest groups.  I believe that by maintaining neutrality on political and social issues, I fostered an atmosphere with my students that promoted free exchange and critical thinking.  So rather than directing my energies to causes that I admire, I have directed my service directly to my students.  For example, using my uncompensated personal time to coach students for international competitions.","I have served as an officer in each of the HOAs of which I have been a member for the last 20 years, most recently as the President of the Miner's Lake HOA.","I am a decision scientist by training.  I have spent more than 30 years conducting research into decision scenarios that are characterized by high stakes, time pressure, and uncertainty.  My earlier work involved the study of decision making in teams and small groups, and so I am an expert in processes used to form consensus in heterogeneous groups.  More recently, I have been investigating biases in judgment and perception related to geo-spatial reasoning -- for example, estimating the location of landfall for a hurricane, or the best location to search for an aircraft lost at sea.  The process of redistricting involves many of these same geo-spatial biases.  My research has been funded by several federal agencies, most notably the Office of Naval Research.  I am especially skilled at transforming the findings of my research into practical guidance for sailors and Marines.  I look forward to bringing these same capabilities to bear on the Colorado redistricting effort on behalf of all the citizens of our state.","I think the key to resolving conflict will be to discover the shared values among the stakeholders.  This requires the ability to listen and have empathy.  Those are skills I possess.  Not all values are shared, and in that case, it is important to understand the relative importance of the goals for each stakeholder.  The process of promoting consensus involves finding ways to promote the shared values while also trading-off on the relatively less-important unshared values.  I have a lot of experience with this sort of small-group decision process via many years of faculty meetings and neighborhood meetings.  Obviously, the stakes in those examples are much lower, but the process is the same: how do you reach agreement without creating animosity among people you work with or live near?  In the case of redistricting, I think I am aided because I don't identify with any political party, so I don't view the process through the lens of winning and losing.  Rather I think I can be fair and impartial while working towards the shared goal of finding the best district boundaries that achieve the priorities of the Reapportionment Amendment and the Hobbs decision.","I have donated to Amy McGrath in her campaign against Mitch McConnell for the US Senate in Kentucky.

Starting in electronics, communications/rf, systems engineer & repair, leading to networking, and computer repair. In all cases solutions to problems had to fit the conditions -- you can't fake data to solve a problem. Research often solved problems (similar problems, or seemingly similar problems often lead to accurate answers). Sometimes you found out that you didn't have enough information; I couldn't be afraid to ask for additional resources when potential solutions didn't work, or results didn't meet expectations. In other words, sometimes you have to start over, as the apparent scope of the problem didn't fit the results. It happened occasionally -- let your customer know that a problem remained unresolved and add additional resources to the data gathering (where often information about prior work changed the resulting efforts). As well as add additional 3rd party technical expertise (more finite analysis of the symptoms). With my business it isn't much different. If a customer wants some work done I am not particularly familiar with, I research the request: process, materials, tooling, time required, ability to master the techniques in a timely matter; will it be financially worth it to do the work (do I expect to do it again, not make as much margin; will the first customer be willing to pay enough to do the work, etc).

And everyone has something of value to contribute. Some will contribute ideas, some will contribute by asking hard questions or requiring accurate data. Others simply by putting together data. Even those that aren't in agreement force the rest to confirm their reasons for a decision. Being fair is usually as simple as being polite -- let the other person have a say, wait for your turn, etc. Being impartial shouldn't be an issue for anyone on the committee -- leave it at the door; this is a job as much as it is a civic responsibility.","Advocate for Colorado gun rights, attended Legislature meetings.

Among other things, this means that district lines are not written in such a way to ensure a particular outcome, but rather that citizens in each district are given real choice with candidates that attend to the needs and interests of the population.  Second, I am a strong believer in shared community responsibility.  While it is easy to criticize the decisions of others, we often forget how difficult it is to shoulder the decisions.  I offer my time and effort to share that responsibility.","I have concentrated my efforts on addressing environmental issues and community support.

Not all social phenomena are measurable or accepted as valid, and thus I am also very much attuned to how ideas are communicated, sometimes very intentionally designed to divide.  I have also paid attention to the details of redistricting (legal rules, political manuevering, technology aids in achieving politically-favored results, etc.).  While I cannot claim expertise in mapping, I am an analytical thinker and balanced thinker who can spot bias.","Being even-handed and building consensus are critical practices in my teaching and community service.  I seek to identify needs and shared interests in building towards agreement -- moving away from hard positions to language that fosters a commitment to supporting our common ground.  I have long used the negotiation principles and practices developed in the book ""Getting to Yes.""  
In terms of my ability to be fair or impartial, these are practices critical in any effective community activity or in the teaching environment, and most particularly in the contemporary political science class. I communicate to students at the outset that we should expect disagreement and this is partly due to our different sets of life experiences.  Furthermore, none of us has a lock on ""the truth,"" and instead it is the collective set of perspectives that will help us to identify our common reality and get us closer to ""the truth.""  This is akin to the traditional Indian parable, ""the blind men and the elephant.""  With this at the foundation, I am committed to not only giving fair and equal voice to competing perspectives, but also asking individuals to ""step into the shoes of the other"" as we consider why we might disagree.  I favor coming to the middle rather than than win-lose outcomes.","As an academic focused on American politics, I am an avid observer of politics, including of redistricting politics.

Please also discuss your ability to be fair or impartial. 
Since I was a child fairness has always been a part of my personal profile and it has always pained me to see someone being treated unfairly. Equity and consensus building are key elements in any good leaders.  People will not listen or follow if they do not believe they are being treated fairly. Fairness and impartiality are showing respect for fellow citizens and any process.  I pride myself in my how I conduct myself in my professional world and my private life. It is how we treat each other that matters most. A primary ingredient in reaching agreement is showing others that they are being heard. This action shows others that the element of respect.  Respect and fairness go hand in hand when working with others.   
As an educator I know that we all learn differently.  Children that are special needs must be provided more time or special assistance to get to the objective, just as all the other students reach the objective following a different path of learning.  This is fair and just. Also, when there was a decision to be made I always try to include others to give staff, students and parents a voice and a path to be part of the solution.",Assisted with voter registration and GOTV for 2020 and 2016.,https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/936

High School Diploma, 1997, South High School (Minneapolis, MN)","I was excited to vote in favor of Ammendments Y & Z in 2018 because I believed it would put Colorado in a position of leadership when it comes to fair redistricting and elections. I believe strongly in fair elections, and while I have my own personal opinions on issues, I also deeply believe that everyone should have fair representation in elections, regardless of their opinion or position. I have been disappointed to see examples where redistricting became a tool used for voter suppression or gerrymandering and am very excited that Colorado developed a process to avoid these outcomes when redistricting. I believe I can support the process as a member of the commission with my background in leadership, communication, team-building, education, and data analysis and I would be thrilled to be of service to all Coloradans in helping to maintain fair elections.","My first experience with organizing was in 2001-2001 when I served as an Americorps community organizer for a year, working with residents of mobile home parks, lawyers, and advocates to represent the interest of mobile home residents and to lobby cities, counties and the state to promote affordable housing solutions. From that role I moved into the field of education and public health promotion. Recently as a member of the board of directors for the Colorado Mountain Club, I have represented the organization in a development and fundraising capacity to community partners. I have also represented my industry (outdoor/climbing industry) by participating on the board of advisors for the Warren Tech High School Outdoor Leadership Program as well as at the Climbing Wall Association annual conference, where I have participated as a panelist. In my current employment, I have also advocated internally to promote access to climbing for community groups and partners, which has led to long-term engagement with several community groups.","Board of Directors, Colorado Mountain Club, October 2019-present Board of Industry Advisors, Warren Tech High School, Outdoor Leadership Program, 2017-present Climbing Wall Association, 2016-present","Some of my past jobs and training have involved significant data-analysis and program evaluation, but regardless of my role I am a data seeker in my decision making process. And while I try to empathize with an emotional perspective, I do not let emotional arguments determine my decision making. As an example, in the customer service context that I operate in currently, an individual might bring up a complaint or may be vocal about an opinion. As convincing as they may be about their concern or opinion, I will dive much deeper into the root of the issue to determine if their concern is widely held or represents a larger problem, before making a decision based on one or a handful of comments. It can be tempting to make decisions based only on an individual's compelling argument or emotional plea, but I am committed to delving deeper and gathering more information to understand a problem better (and determine if it is in fact a problem) before attempting to solve it. In the real world, great data doesn't always exist, so to avoid analysis paralysis and be in a position to move forward, I supplement data-analysis with experience, seeking input, and discussing options, and considering potential outcomes before making a decision. I also keep in mind the larger goal - solving a problem should be in service of achieving our vision and mission. For example, my company's current vision is to transform the world through the experience of climbing (we run climbing gyms). When I receive input from customers, I will consider the problem of a member feeling excluded from the community much more seriously than the problem of our gym not having a sauna for member use. One problem (inclusion) is directly related to achieving our vision, the other (sauna) simply represents someone's personal preference for their gym experience, but solving that problem will not contribute materially to our overall vision. Part of the reason I would like to be involved in this commission is because I enjoy the process of problem solving and am excited to participate in the challenging process of redistricting for Colorado.","I am a big-picture thinker and in my job am frequently required to move a group toward consensus. Of course I have personal opinions on issues, but I do let let an attachment to a particular position cloud my ability to consider many perspectives and keep the larger objective in mind. I have found that my own opinions often evolve as I engage in discussion or a consensus-building process, so I have learned over the years that my initial position on may not be my final position - all of which is to say I am committed to achieving the larger goal/vision of my work than remaining attached to a particular strategy/tactic or position. I am able to listen actively and engage with people who hold perspectives different from my own to reach conclusions or take action. In a group setting such as this commission, I could play a role of facilitator, active listener, observer, and monitor (in the sense of monitoring if our work is on track or identifying if we are getting away from the bigger goal/objective). A major professional challenge I have moved through recently is a merger of two companies, and my role at a leader in the organization was to repeatedly express the vision of the company, the objectives/goals we are moving toward, gather input from stakeholders, and to have conversations that build buy-in to our new company's direction. In this process, I have been able to support two large teams in moving in a new direction, finding common ground with this direction, and generally feeling bought-in to our collective work and the outcomes. I like to approach problem solving as a collaborative learning process, where through the process we elevate the group's collective knowledge and wisdom to come up with solutions and make decisions that best serve our common goal. In this process, I may not always get ""my way,"" but I also know that a group can come up with more brilliant, practical, or elegant solutions that I could on my own, so I promote collaboration, learning, and always refocusing on our common goals. I believe I also am well equipped to be fair and impartial on this commission. I do not put my personal opinions/values above the larger goal, in this case supporting fair redistricting and fair elections. As a manager and supervisor, I have tried to apply principles of fairness to my teams, to reduce the possibility of favoritism or expression of bias.","To my best recollection, I have donated to the following.

Our HOA covenants was set up unfairly such that more than 1/2 of the community was paying more for HOA fees than others and the disparity was growing every time HOA fees were raised because of a covenant rule that a portion of the neighborhood should pay 1.5 times more than the other portion. The HOA fees are used for maintenance of amenities in the community to which all households have equal access.  I lead the committee to research (with the help of a couple of board members) how we could change the covenants and educate the community on how the HOA fees were used for assets to which everyone has equal access. We learned that we would have to have an election to add an amendment to remove the 1.5 times rule. 

I sent out polls for the community to vote on preferred methods of equalizing the fees. Although this seemed like an insurmountable task the poll indicated that 18 or 19 of the homeowners who were paying less would vote for the change to the covenants.  This was a sign that the task was not insurmountable and we proceeded with community meetings and presentations which I put together. Myself and the two board members presented the information. We held an election and my team and I canvassed the neighborhood to make sure everyone voted.  We needed 20 households that were paying less to vote for equalizing fees and increase their fees.  22 fair-minded neighbors voted for the amendment!

Having everyone show up with their own numbers was often counterproductive.

It is a critical element of our democracy and I find it sadly frustrating that so many people choose not to participate, and yet, still want their voices heard somehow. After decades of discussions and study, I know that people fail to participate because they feel that their representatives don't listen or have their own agendas. I believe much of this attitude is the result of gerrymandering and it has caused great dissatisfaction among the voting population. All people want is for their vote to weigh equally with any one else's vote. Gerrymandering has inhibited fair elections in the US almost since our inception and it is simply time to put an end to this practice. It will encourage more people to participate and will result in more fairness in election results. Additionally, people are sick of the same representatives and senators representing them term after term. The system, as it stands now, is designed to encourage incumbents win re-election, which limits new ideas and voices in our system.","This is an integral part of teaching the Social Sciences.

I received my PhD in College Student Personnel Administration from the University of Northern Colorado in 1987.,"In 1969 I entered Colorado State University (CSU) as a Political Science major. My interest in the democratic process was strong then and has continued to grow. After working at CSU for 44 years and nearing retirement in May 2021 I have maintained my strong interest in volunteer public service and citizen participation in the political process. The Colorado Independent Redistricting Commission offers an excellent opportunity to serve the state of Colorado.

The commission provides a solution to promote fair redistricting. I have a strong belief that the process of redistricting should be guided by transparency and public input. Additionally, I believe that maps should fairly reflect the will of the voters and that the redistricting commission can improve outcomes and satisfaction across all stakeholders. Protecting the voting rights of persons-of-color, and balancing the preservation of communities of interest with the preservation of county and municipal boundaries is vitally important.

Serving on the commission requires the ability to be fair and impartial. For the past 30 years at CSU, I have served as an Equal Opportunity Representative on university search committees, a responsibility that has fairness and impartiality at its core. Additionally, my doctoral dissertation was on ethical decision-making. I taught an Ethics course at the graduate level for over ten years, conducted ethics workshops for the university and community, and presented on ethical decision making at conferences nationally and internationally. The quest for fairness has been a lifetime endeavor.

At CSU, I have served on a joint-appointment as both an administrator and faculty member for 37 years. In my faculty role I served as Program Chair for a Master’s program with over 30 faculty which required the ability to promote consensus and agreement on a daily basis. I was able to develop a collegial environment and build consensus on curricular development, course content, and student issues.  Effectively promoting agreement involved listening, collaboration, and clear communication.

For the past 12 years I have served at the Executive Director of Assessment and Research at CSU. A position that requires analytical skills and the ability to apply logic. The position involves analyzing numerous quantitative and qualitative research and assessment projects, evaluating programs and services, and guiding departments through their five-year program reviews. I have been very successful in using the data to help the institution increase its effectiveness and improve its programs. I also served at the Director of Research on the board of directors of the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators (NASPA), and chaired the Committee on Commissioned Research for the Association of College and University Housing Officers – International (ACUHO-I). In addition to analytical skills and the application of logic, the coin of the realm in all of these positions is trust and credibility.

I am currently working half-time and will be fully retiring from CSU at the end of May, 2021. I make the best of every day and look forward to contributing considerable time to the commission.

Bachelor's degree in civil engineering from Colorado State University in Fort Collins (2018)","I would like to serve on the commission because I want to ensure that the representative district boarders are drawn fairly without the effects of gerrymandering. As an unaffiliated voter, generally displeased with the two party system, I am interested in making sure the Colorado State representatives in congress are elected fairly and competitively. 

Colorado unfortunately has a history of gerrymandering in order to give one political party more power over another. Districting commissions often also re-draw districting lines in order to protect their own seat (or the incumbent member of their party) in office. These tactics need to stop in order for the voice of the people of Colorado to truly be heard. If the districts are organized such that the representative earns the votes of their constituents. This is very important to me as a Colorado voter because not only to I want my voice to be heard, but I want to ensure the same for my fellow Coloradans. Especially if Colorado is to obtain an eighth seat in the House of Representatives. 

The great President John F. Kennedy said, “Let us not seek the Republican answer of the Democratic answer, but the right answer. Let us not seek to fix the blame for the past. Let us accept our own responsibility for the future.” My primary goal as a member of this commission will be to seek that right answer. I love this state, and I believe that the governmental tactics and changes taking place here in Colorado have been and continue to be a model for the nation. That is why I am interested in serving on the commission, not only to serve my state but to serve my country.","As a general contractor, it was important to maintain a positive relationship with all of the trade partners working on site to keep them coordinated and functional. As a project engineer with Martines Palmeiro Construction (MPC) I had to advocate for both the organizations who worked under mine and our clients in the day-to-day tasks in the field. Often times a trade partner would interfere with another trade partner’s work for their own convenience. I had to ensure that the best interests of all the trades were executed in order maintain a functional site. Furthermore, it was also my responsibility to ensure that the best interests of the owner were being executed despite the fact that the owner was not present on site. Nearly all of the trade partners I worked with are based in Colorado, as many of them are small businesses in the Denver area.","I spent the majority of the past five years since November 10, 2015 as a student at both Colorado State University (CSU) in Fort Collins and University of Colorado (CU) in Boulder. Because of this most of my public involvement was within my university community. At CSU I served as student ambassador for the College of Engineering, which I belonged to. As an ambassador I worked primarily with high school students considering majoring in engineering, at CSU or otherwise. I gave advice to these students as they made their college decisions and offered my perspective to them as both an engineering student and as a CSU Ram. 

At the end of my undergraduate education at CSU, I joined a professional origination known as the Order of the Engineer. This is an organization that upholds the ethical standards of engineers in our society. As many people entrust their lives with the structures and technology designed by engineers, this organization continuously reminds them of the responsibly they hold.

In graduate school at CU, I earned a scholarship from the Structural Engineers Association of Colorado (SEAC) and have attended a number of meetings and site visits with the organization since. Although I am not an official SEAC member, I am currently considering joining this organization as well.","Being a structural engineer, logic and reason come very naturally to me. I am a fast learner and an analytical thinker. I am exceptionally good at Excel and I enjoy solving mathematically interesting problems. I am also a young and enthusiastic individual who likes a good challenge. 

When I was a graduate student at CU, I had to apply these skills to my research project in order to report accurate and unbiased results. For this project, I was tasked investigating the effects of a polymer additive on the freeze-thaw properties of concrete. To do this, I had to college and analyze a significant amount of data over the course of several months. I also had to write and defend my thesis in front of several faculty members and concrete experts to prove my results were valic. I would take a similar approach to the task of re-districting Colorado. My “data collection” phase would involve hearing the voices of my fellow Coloradans scattered throughout the state. My “analysis” phase would be the actual re-drawing of the district lines with the assistance of the other commissioners. And finally my “defense” phase would be to convince and mediate among the other members of the committee.","As a member of the commission, I will advocate for the use of the shortest-split line method to divide the voters throughout the state into fairly divided, equally populated areas. The use of this algorithm is at least a good place to start, because it uses a mathematical method that is free of bias. I would also use that as an argument among the other commissioners, because you can’t argue with math. As an engineer, I am good at both being analytical and convincing of an impartial answer. 

Next, I think it’s worth considering the cultural density of the various areas of the state. For example, because Baca County and Prowers County are culturally similar to each other, it may make sense to group them together in the same district. However, it is important to make sure there is a healthy amount of competition for the candidates running to represent these districts. For example if it is known that the majority of voters in Weld County are Republicans and the majority of voters in Larimer County are Democrats, it may make sense to group Weld and Larimer County together in the same district to encourage both the Republican and Democratic candidates for that district to campaign harder to earn their votes.","In the past five years, I have been interested but not heavily involved in political activities outside of voting. I have not given money to any organizations other than the perchance a Marco Rubio bumper sticker in 2016. At the end of 2019 I also signed a petition in Colorado that put Proposition 115 on the 2020 ballot and made a $5 donation supporting the initiative 

Although I grew up in a mostly conservative household, I am an independent thinker who may align with the Libertarian party rather than the Democratic or Republican party. I even voted Libertarian in 2016 because I felt that both of the two major candidates were not representative of how most people in America think. But because I do not want to subject myself a political party, I am an unaffiliated citizen and have chosen to apply for this commission as such.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/70

During the summer of 1999, I spent my MBA internship working for Etak, an in-dash vehicle navigation company later sold to Tele Atlas/Tom Tom.  (Etak's work was the precursor to much of the google maps navigation technology we are all using today).  My focus there was on a geocoding plug-in used with ESRI's ArcView software.

The past 20 years I have been working in the private sector with businesses that, among other things, use GIS for marketing purposes. I solve problems like 'fine me daycares nears King Soopers in neighborhoods that index high on Hispanics'  This sort of project requires the collection of quality data, and the software necessary to analyze that data.  I think that my experience building high quality datasets and using tools to analyze them will come in handy when analyzing congressional districts.  [Note: I will not collect letters of recommendation at this stage unless I am told by someone reviewing this that it is important to my application.  If it is important, I will likely reach out to one or more of the following people: Gary Justus, neighbor, EMHA president, fellow EMHA board member during my tenure; Ingrid Mielke, principal, Parmalee Elementary; possibly Alex Tait, National Geographer, National Geographic. Not sure Alex has the time though!)","Have you ever been an HOA president?  It is a ton of work, largely thankless, and all about building consensus as best as possible.

I sat on the reapportionment commission in 1990 and experienced how difficult it was to reach consensus in a process that was designed to encourage political clashes between the two major parties.

The commission is a combination of Democrats and Republicans who work together to manage the wildlife resources of the state of Colorado.

I also sat on the board of trustees for Adams State University for eight years and was the chairman of the board for three consecutive years. This board is also made up of members who are from opposing  political  parties who also must work together to serve the best interest of the University. These two experiences have given me a tremendous insight into working with people of different backgrounds, different political parties and different philosophies.

I have always been drawn to opportunities like this one but have hesitated both because of time considerations and also because of potential conflicts with the requirements of my employment. I am now free to take on something like this wholeheartedly and with great enthusiasm. I began thinking about this possibility as soon as I saw the ballot issue that created these commissions. I was thrilled to see it pass with voter approval. I am proud of Colorado for being on the forefront with this new and exciting process. I would love to serve as a commission member, knowing full well how much responsibility this would be and embracing the challenge. The outcomes of the decisions made by the commissions are highly impactful and important. I believe I can help build consensus and provide needed objectivity, seeing the big picture and the needs of our State as a whole while also valuing the impact to various localities. During my employment with Colorado State University, I met with students in the Distance Learning Program around the State of Colorado, with much of my time spent in Colorado Springs and Denver Metro as well as locally in Larimer County. I visited students in Gunnison,  Salida, and in La Junta. In a separate effort I did consulting work in Durango evaluating local needs and resources for a potential self-sufficiency program. I believe I have gained valuable experience regarding statewide needs during the course of performing these duties.","While employed as Executive Director for Project Self-Sufficiency of Loveland - Fort Collins (1989-2014) I worked closely with the Board of Directors to set policy, create the budget, and engage in community relations. During this time I often assisted in resolving differences, explaining the needs of the program participants and staff, and setting the direction for the organization. I took a democratic approach to staff supervision and utilized staff meetings to make joint decisions after listening to varying points of view.  I represented the organization and our constituents at advocacy meetings in Denver at the Women's Foundation of Colorado. There we discussed barriers to the well being of our constituent populations and planned interventions to secure resources and encourage needed governmental policy changes. We gathered data on the ""cliff effect"" that results when families lose benefits following very small wage increases. I attended many interagency community meetings in Fort Collins over those years to engage in conversations with many other organizations serving similar client populations. We networked, found ways to work together to solve problems, shared information and resources, and worked together to communicate with funders on behalf of disadvantaged individuals and families. I continue to maintain many of these relationships today and am sometimes called upon to assist in my retirement years. This has included volunteering for the City of Loveland during their annual event to distribute needed items and resource information.","I have a group of friends who write letters to elected officials and I have done this with them a number of times over the past year.

I was the Executive Director for that organization for 25 years and continue to serve on the Scholarship Committee, host a table at the luncheon, and consult with the current Executive Director.

When relevant I would look at research and best practices, considering similar situations and how those decisions turned out. Learning from past mistakes is critical.","I believe the basis for consensus building is seeking common ground and looking at shared values and experiences. I would seek to understand the thinking of my fellow committee members and identify shared concerns and values.

I would consider all the various populations and communities that would be impacted and what their special needs might be. I would be cognizant of income disparities and ethic diversity.

I believe I could bring a unique perspective as a native Coloradan who has close ties to colleagues, family and friends from across the State that includes both metropolitan centers as well as rural Colorado","During my career and community life in metropolitan Denver, I have had the opportunity to work with small, emerging, minority, and women owned businesses to assist them in working with the State of Colorado, other public institutions, and corporations.  I have worked as a volunteer at KUVO Public Radio Station as an on-air host.  I worked as a member of a curatorial team to Mexico, Colombia and Brazil to build working relationships with theatre and performing artists to perform in the United States.  Using these travels to see cultural performances around our hemisphere, I was able to bring home important improvements to our work.  As a member of the American GI Forum, I have been given the opportunity to advocate on behalf of Latino veterans and their families to ensure they receive their benefits and create educational opportunities for the families of the veterans.

These goals and plans were presented to the effected communities, employees, businesses, and elected and appointed officials.  It was critical that I understood the data analysis, anecdotal information, survey information and more when proposing goals and plans.  In addition, I became proficient in reading, understanding and interpreting Federal Regulations and State Statutes in order to ensure that our programs and plans were in compliance with Federal and State Rules and Regulations.","In my role as Director of the Center for Equal Opportunity at CDOT and before that at the Regional Transportation District, I worked with numerous stakeholders that included large and small business owners, prime and subcontractors, impacted communities, elected officials, and grassroots community members.  When we would set annual goals for business and employment, it was important to hold and lead discussions that would eventually bring groups to a consensus.  On many occasions it was critical for me to put my personal feelings aside and work to find agreement with all parties.  I also understand that once agreement is found between a group of decision makers that it is important to support the final decisions and not undermine those made by the group.","Crisanta Duran, 2016; Joseph Salazar, 2017; Xochitl Gaytan School Board, 2017; Angie Rivera RTD, 2018; Adrienne Benavidez 2016",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/354

My aim in doing so is to become a fully-qualified commissioner on day one.","My overall approach is to recommend what is best for Colorado as a whole.  We have a strong state with many positive aspects, none of which I want to see diminished or endangered.  I want to listen carefully to what everyone has to say.  Ultimately, this commission will be considering tradeoffs between different criteria. Since there will be no straightforward, universal consensus on what is ""fair"", I believe we should first establish ground rules on what we will prioritize based on legal requirements, community input, staff guidance, and the unique attributes that make Colorado great.  As we move into looking at partitioning plans, I would respectfully guide the commission to play by those ground rules.  We do, however, have guidance on what is not fair: gerrymandered district partitions.

Voting has always been important in my family, but I would not have considered myself “political”. My dad was involved in town council in Pine Haven Wyoming and my aunt was mayor of Pine Knoll Shores in North Carolina.  They both leaned Republican and many in my family still are Republicans. I aligned with the Democratic Party in 2008 because I wanted to help with the convention.  As I have become more involved, I more closely align with the Democratic platform, such as health care and environmental protections than with the traditional Republican platform of less government involvement and conservative social values. With my background, I have cultivated skills that have built fairness and impartially in my core values.
I struggle with the current administration and it is my hope that after November there will be an increased desire for people to work together for the common good.  We can begin this ideal by working together locally. A couple of years ago, I attended an event at the Denver Film Society in which one of the panelists was Eleanor Clift, a Washington journalist.  She proposed that the intense political division was created in part because people did not know each other at the personal level. She mentioned that Tip O’Neill and Reagan could be friends because they created opportunities to be together after work.  With today’s politicians leaving Washington as soon as work is over and not cultivating after work relationships, the camaraderie is lost.  I will suggest that the commission meet on a non-formal basis to cultivate relationships with each other.  If the group as whole chooses not to do this, I will reach out on a one-on-one basis to build camaraderie.","I have donated money to Steven Woodrow Colorado HD6, Diane Mitsch Bush CD3 and an organization called “Stop Republicans” through Act Blue.

I am a woman, of Asian descent, from a rural community, currently living in a suburban area. Growing
up, I understood the high cost of farming, and how things could turn with an untimely storm or drought,
as well as the magic of watching a crop grow, and the value of a hard day's work. My Asian heritage
provides background knowledge on the minority experience of racial and cultural discrimination. Being a
woman and adoptive mother provides additional lenses to view life. Finding one’s identity is especially
difficult for an adopted child who must sort through abandonment issues, and racial issues compounding
the already complex task of growing up. Women face every day challenges of balancing work and family,

of all ethnic groups and genders. I helped organize family camps for several ethnicities as well as other
activities for families to educate, and provide social spaces for children to be with families who are in
similar situations.
In TUFIR we actively supported students and adults who were in the GEO ICE facility, and also
immigrants that were newly released from the facility. We provided food, clothing and money as support
as well as letters to ICE and our school district in support of immigrants. We also held training seminars
for adults and students on knowing your rights.
As the lead mentor for our FIRST Robotics team I advocated for kids of all ethnicities, genders and

our learning team, as teachers, we collected data, analyzed, reported out and modified by consensus our
teaching methods to improve student achievement. We always worked within a strict budget to purchase
chemicals and equipment. As a teacher, I taught students about the importance of producing data,
analyzing the data, checking for error and causes of error, and coming to conclusions based on data and
analysis.
As lead mentor for robotics I was in charge of creating and maintaining a budget to build the robot and
participate in competitions in and out of state. Engineering requires critical thinking and analytic skills to
design a robot that not only functions on paper, but also in real life competitions over several days.
During the build season we strategize, prototype, analyze and communicate to determine the best design.
We are constantly testing, analyzing and reworking designs. As is evident, I am very adept at not only
utilizing analytical skills, but also teaching them.","When I had conferences with parents and students, I always allowed the parent and student to speak first,

work backward to determine what actions would be needed to achieve those common goals.
Each year the robotics team has to tackle the challenge of designing and building a robot to play a new
game designed by engineers at FIRST. Our team consists of high school students, teachers, and engineer
mentors from the community. We established norms developed by our leadership team and mentors. At
the brainstorming session we announce and emphasize that everyone's opinion is important and worth
hearing. We divide into small groups, and after everyone has presented, make a list of pros and cons for
each idea. This helps make the process objective and is a framework for collaboration I would bring to
the commission.","Cary Kennedy for Governor - volunteered and donated

Additionally, as a resident of very rural Clear Creek County, I believe that I can bring a ""mountain perspective"" to the commission.

I also am privileged enough to enjoy a career and a job that would allow me to participate in this critical process, without major disruption of my professional life or paycheck.

Air Line Pilots Association--union member","My professional life consists of taking a packet of information (weather, aircraft mechanical state, airport conditions, terrain considerations, and in some cases geopolitical considerations) and distilling that information into a useable plan to accomplish a given task (to fly from point A to B).  This involves the rest of the flight crew I am operating with (I have been a captain, first officer, and relief pilot at various times, all of which involve different leadership gradients), a dispatcher with joint responsibility, and many other entities during complex flights.  All of this must end up with a consensus on how we should operate the flight.  From the moment that plan is agreed to, it is continually monitored and re-evaluated, and adjusted should conditions warrant.  All of this while weighing pros and cons, and operating under a continually ticking clock and continually depleting fuel reserves.

In less time critical situations (which is how the commission would operate), I tend to prioritize a task by critical criteria, starting with what seems most pressing.  Once prioritized, I seek to apply any desirable criteria--especially if I am working with others who might rank the criteria differently than I do.  And once a workable plan appears to be presented, I seek ways to test that plan against the criteria, and adjust it if necessary.","I have spent over 10,000 hours flying airplanes, which is mostly an exercise in assessing information, and building consensus amongst the operating crew members, a skill that I have honed to a pretty high degree.  

I also served a term as an elected leader for a pilots union (IBT Local 357), during one of the most contentious bargaining environments in Railway Labor Act history.  It was one of the driving factors for me running for that position, and I largely acted as the ""independent"" board member making peace between factions on our board.  As part of my experience in union representation, I eventually developed the skills to handle EXTREMELY sensitive discussions (including high stakes discipline, substance abuse issues, harassment cases, hostile membership, and negotiations) respectfully amongst parties who typically displayed open disdain for one another.

As a dyed in the wool independent, I would be unencumbered by partisan pressures entirely, while being naturally inclined towards consensus building as the most effective form of agreement.  I operate in a world that requires a shared mental model and buy in of any decision in an airplane, it's a way of life for me, and has been for over 20 years in my professional life.

I also like to think that I am really good at letting bygones be bygones.  A disagreement with another person on one topic does not need to effect other attempts to build consensus with that person, and it is incredibly important to disagree without being disagreeable with one another.  I basically cannot recall the last time I disagreed with someone I was working on the same task with--I believe because my skills at building a shared mental model lead to consensus so efficiently that things never rise to the level of a real disagreement.

Impartiality is achieved both by my fierce non partisan belief and lifelong devotion to non partisanship, along with the inclusion of fairness and impartiality as critical criteria to work for.  People are allowed to have their own beliefs (including partisan motivations that I might agree or disagree with), but that does not necessarily mean that their viewpoint is not valid and deserving of thoughtful consideration.","Represent.US

I have no interest in political office, but I have been concerned at the direction things have taken of late and want to have a hand in shaping the future direction the state goes in.","My experience thus far has been mainly in contacting elected officials, unelected officials, and the media concerning issues that are of importance to me.  My main focus thus far has been in advocating for privacy rights and transparency in using cell phone data to track citizens' movements, advocating for having the (once the initial emergency has been cleared) Colorado Assembly decide how to respond to pandemics rather than one man in the Governor's chair, and advocating for the rural parts of the state to have more of a voice in Colorado government.  I contact people via phone, via email, and have begun using social media as a way to contact officials and to reach directly through to people using my Facebook group Colorado Accountability Project.  I am also trying to encourage others to get involved by contacting their elected officials.","Outside of being a registered Libertarian since I first started voting, I am not a member of any political organizations.  I am not a member of any civic organizations or community organizations either.  Outside of commitments at my work (which wold be mostly internal committees like the Human Resources Leadership Committee) I am not a member of any other associations","I am not sure how to take the word “analytical” in your question; i.e. I am not sure if you mean analytical in terms of the ability to understand and parse an argument or position, or whether you mean analytical in the mathematical/statistical sense.  In either case I feel that I am well suited in this regard.  I did not take the road into academia, but most of my education has been along that line and I regularly work on learning new things in physics (which requires the ability to understand and break down mathematical/logical arguments and the ability to apply math to them).  I will be honest and tell you that my knowledge of some higher level statistics concepts is incomplete, but I learn quickly and don’t anticipate a problem.
As regards the second part of your question, I do not feel as though I will have an issue applying logic and reasoning to a problem.  When you go to solve a problem in physics or mathematics (especially once you are beyond the level of memorizing a formula and into the areas of novel study) that’s exactly what you do.  Interestingly, it’s also what you do when trying to fix something (I’m working on restoring a track loader and help my dad in his semi restorations) though perhaps with less or a different form of math.  I feel as though I am well practiced in this regard.","I am glad I’m coming upon this question a few years after I got married, because I believe being married has greatly shifted (for the better) my perspective on reaching consensus among two people who have strongly-held, opposite opinions.  If you’re also married, I’m sure you understand as well.  My experience thus far has taught me that promoting consensus or agreement starts by recognizing that people of good will can disagree, and that someone else not seeing things the way I do doesn't make them ignorant or careless or etc.   Starting from that point, I think consensus building or compromise takes the form of outlining why you feel the way you do, what your goals are, outlining what you can't live with, and then finding areas of agreement.  For the things that you cannot agree on, you return to what you can't live with, and start saying what you'll tolerate.  I think keeping in mind that the essence of good compromise means that you (and all other parties) will be a little unhappy helps too.  It keeps you focused on what a reasonable outcome will look like.
I would like to say that I’m perfect in regard to being impartial, but I cannot.  Being fair to others, however, is a big value of mine.  In my experience as a teacher, I have had numerous times where I’ve had a student that I didn’t like, or one that sent a nasty email to my boss, or some such.  I have then had the chance to catch that student in a “gotcha” situation—a situation where they’d broken some minor rule or forgotten a homework or some such.  I cannot tell you how good it would have felt to bring the hammer down, but if I allow everyone else one free mistake, I must allow the troublesome students the same grace--difficult as it is.  That’s plain fairness.  It’s how I would want to be treated.  As another example, you may have been able to read between the lines thus far and know that I disagree vehemently with many things that Gov Polis and others have done.  Perhaps not, but let me know make it explicitly clear.  I disagree vehemently with many of the policy decisions and actions that Polis and others have undertaken.  In my Facebook group posts (Colorado Accountability Project—you’re welcome to go see), I do my best in posting to not step outside the truth and to be fair.  For example, in a recent post (recent as I write this on 8/13), I wrote some notes on Polis taking grant money to fund some of his political priorities.  The very first thing I wrote is that it’s not illegal and he has not been the first governor to do so","This one will be brief.  My political activity is mostly recent.  I have, of course, voted in every election since I was eligible and try to do my due diligence on informing myself of the initiatives and etc. on the ballot, but it wasn't until recently (actually it was Gov Polis emergency declaration and state shutdown that spurred it) that I became more actively involved.  I have not ever, and do not plan to ever, donate money to any campaign, candidate, or political organization.  I have, however, spent a great deal of time emailing and talking to both elected and unelected people in the areas of interest to me in an effort to influence and change what I have seen happening lately in Colorado.  I have also (because the response rate from officials and the media can be dishearteningly small) begun to create groups and use social media to expand my reach and to go directly to people.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/77

Problems can arise from all sorts of angles and it’s my job to anticipate and mitigate those potential issues. In my brewing career, problems were often more acute and required immediate, effective action to resolve. There is little time to deliberate when an enormous tank is leaking, and so I developed a quick response time to problems that does not compromise the effectiveness of the solution. In my academic training, I built a foundation of logical and reasoned analysis since the field of chemistry tolerates no other type of analysis. In my leisure time, I’m always eager to learn a new board game or puzzle because they help me think about strategic problem solving in a new light. Tasks like the Commission’s are a good fit for me.","I have found success throughout my personal and professional life in guiding meetings and conversations to a place that promotes consensus. I once managed a 30-person team of graduate student volunteers, which is a fragile coalition to hold together since students always have competing interests for their time and, being volunteers, I could offer them no material incentives. I was ultimately able to keep the group engaged, and on this and other teams I have relied upon a few key building blocks to set the stage for productive collaboration.


Confirm goals and check assumptions: Do we have a common understanding of our purpose? Are there facts we all recognize? Many disagreements can be forestalled by establishing a baseline of goals and information that the entire group accepts.


Match outcomes to goals: What does success look like? Does this hypothetical result comport with our mission? Why or why not? Holding up possible outcomes for consideration helps ground the group in the reality of their decisions.


Connect actions to outcomes: If we take this step, will it lead to the result we want? The result that we agree will help achieve our goals? Actions can be more easily agreed upon if their connections to prior points of consensus are made clear; it is also important to deliberately give proposed actions a reality check for unintended consequences.


Half the battle (at least) of gathering consensus from a diverse group lies in simply avoiding derailment, since tangents constantly threaten to intrude and have a tendency to build their own momentum once instigated. Furthermore, it is crucial to follow good evidence wherever it leads and to be an active listener who strives to hear the truth in the experiences of one’s peers. These steps, attitude, and adherence to evidence are crucial ingredients for impartiality and consensus-building, and I believe a good process leads to good outcomes. While a harmonious ending is never guaranteed, these factors maintain a focus on the right questions and lead to the right conversations. I will strive to foster this collaborative process on the Commission.","Small amounts (<$150) to:

My academic training was mostly in philosophy (with a smattering of political science), and one of my main interests was in ethics.  The intersection of democracy and ethics is the notion of equity for all citizens; viz. that every person has equal say and power to shape the nature of the political bodies which affect his/her live.

The way that voting districts are set up is, obviously, the foundation of whether any particular system is equitable or not.  Redistricting has been used for partisan purposes—by all political parties—from well before Governor Gerry ‘gerrymandered’ the Massachusetts districts in 1812 up to today.  This has been the source of a considerable lack of fairness in our political system.  I would be honored and excited to be able to participate in this important work.

I am proud of Colorado for being a leader in the movement to take the redistricting function away from legislatures in order to try to come up with a fair and rational process which will benefit all citizens in a equitable fashion.  This is an important step forward both for Colorado, and through our example, for the rest of the country.

I believe that I am intellectually suited and trained to be able to wrestle with the issues that a redistricting committee will face, I have a very strong sense of the importance of fairness, I have strong organizational skills, and, of course, I also am very well versed in map related subjects.","As a dealer in antiquarian maps and prints, I joined the board of the Denver Public Library Friends Foundation almost as soon as I moved to Colorado, from Philadelphia, in 2010.

I have also been a board member of the Rocky Mountain Map Society, running both their regular lecture programs and their annual Map Month every May (except this one).  These are all free programs open to the public.

Two of my main areas of study were ethics and logic.  The latter is something which I feel is a sine non qua for any rational argument, and indeed I have taught a class in informal logic to high school students as I think it is a skill necessary for any “reasoned life.”  I believe one of my most important and strong skills is the ability to reason in a logical manner.","My academic training was much focused on philosophical argument, in the sense of being able to take an open-minded and clear-eyed look at the issues involved in any particular question to be decided.  I have the ability to identify the core issues of various questions and to present them in a clear and unbiased manner.  Even if I disagree with another person in an argument, I am adept at understanding his/her viewpoint and am able to lay out exactly where and why we disagree.  This does not always solve the argument, but it at least lets the parties understand the real issues involved.

In terms of fairness, my belief in the fundamental importance of fairness is rooted in the moral belief which I hold to be the most important to live by, viz. that everyone should treat others as they wish to be treated.  If one follows this Golden Rule, then fairness necessarily follows, as no one would want to be treated unfairly by another.  I have mostly supported the Democratic Party in the last decade or so, but that support is circumstantial; my support for a fair, equitable political system is far more foundational to my beliefs.","I was a Precinct Committee Person for the Democratic Party, Precinct 623, House District 6, from 2015 to 2016.

Degree in English/Minor in Journalism","I want to serve on the commission because I want to make a difference.  I want to make a difference for Colorado voters.  As Booker T. Washington noted, “Those who are happiest are those who do the most for others” 

And, what can we do for others that is more important than ensure Colorado’s voters are fairly represented in our state’s Congressional and state districts?  The doctrine—one person, one vote—requires that electoral districts be apportioned fairly and accurately.  The 2021 redistricting of Colorado is extremely important.  Our state’s population has grown over the last 10 years.  Based on new census data, Colorado could gain an addition seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.  That would expand our state’s influence in national politics and increase federal funding for state projects.  Redistricting also impacts representation of Colorado’s growing diversity.","When I arrived in Washington, DC, there were two women working in the government affairs area.  One worked for the railroads and the other was with the International Ladies’ Garment Workers of America.  Those of us being hired for similar positions had few mentors.  We needed direction.  Twelve of us in the food industry founded Women in Government Relations.  Monthly luncheons featured effective speakers who gave us confidence and professional guidance.  For example, Elizabeth Dole spoke at a luncheon when she was serving on the Federal Trade Commission.  We shared books on effective management.  Our first salary survey resulted in 15 women getting raises after they presented the data to their bosses and demonstrated they were underpaid.  

My work with the Front Range Community College Foundation includes writing pieces some of which emphasize the importance of scholarships in graduating skilled employees who meet Colorado businesses’ needs and how important they are to the state’s economy.  I gave an endowment to the college for needed equipment for students enrolled in our new Center for Integrated Manufacturing programs.","Current:  Front Range Community College Foundation – Board, Executive Committee, Chair of the Communications Committee; National Marine Mammal Foundation – Board, Secretary, Chair of the Communications and Investment Committees; Women in Government Relations – retired/emeritus/one of the 12 founders of the group
Past:  Ranch Reserve Homeowners Association, The Senior Hub, and Susan G. Komen Colorado","You cannot successfully run an organization without realistic budgeting.  You cannot successfully run a homeowners association without realistic budgeting and sufficient reserves for the future.  You cannot chair an Investment Committee without a Board-approved investment policy.  You cannot hire a new investment manager without a Request for Proposal.  You cannot look forward without thoughtful strategic planning.  No new challenge is unsurmountable.  You analyze.  You do research.  You learn.  You get it done.

While head of the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums, mediation was rarely needed.   But, a few situations demanded it.  A member was doing or saying something to the media that embarrassed another member.  Changing behavior and coming to an agreement takes patience, empathy, and persuasive skills.  

And, then there is communications.  A messaging strategy is the key to successfully marketing a business, a product, a political campaign, or a new concept, as well as effectively meeting both professional and personal goals and objectives.  The Front Range Community College Foundation depends on generous, caring donors to fund scholarships for needy students and capital improvements.  I draft many funding requests for Foundation staff to distribute.  The challenge is to understand your audience, analyze their motivations, and identify what has value and will motivate a potential donor to give.  This has been especially important during this pandemic, which caused students to lose their part-time jobs and their parents to lose their jobs and businesses.  The Foundation created a High Needs Fund for both students and adjunct instructors.  Many needed help, which required constant fundraising.  It was very rewarding when donors reacted positively and we could help so many students continue their educations.  One story we told often is that of a single mom who lost her job because of Covid.  She could no longer afford her apartment.  She moved in with her grandparents.  Because they are elderly, she could not search for another job, fearing if she brought the virus home they could die.  She needed help paying basic bills once she lost her income.  Booker T. Washington’s words ring very true when helping FRCC students reach for their dreams.","My Washington, DC, experiences and the various positions I held were centered on finding consensus among members of these organizations with different points of view and varying political perspectives.  I could not have succeeded without being fair and impartial.

I have never worked for any organization where I did not discuss issues with a team in the course of making a decision.  It varied from working with the Board to working with members of a committee.  Yes, I analyzed the issue, researched it, and crafted a recommendation.  But, it was only through consensus that a decision was reached. 

Cognitive empathy is essential in coming to any agreement.  Active listening is effective.  It requires listening attentively and paraphrasing what has been said in any response, underscoring that you have heard and understand the point being made by another team member.  I socialize monthly with a neighbor who supports the opposite political party.  I bring up many, many subjects for discussion on which I know we can agree as caring women.  It underscores that we all have more we can agree on than disagree on in this sadly divisive time.","I was a volunteer in Dianne Primavera’s last campaigns for election and reelection to Colorado’s House of Representatives.  I worked on writing projects for Noel Ginsburg’s Colorado gubernatorial campaign in 2018.

Part of the good in the world is assuring that all citizens in Colorado have a voice and are represented in their vote via fair voting maps.  As an unaffiliated voter, and a fluent speaker of three languages, I firmly believe that people on the commission should represent and be able to try to connect to everyone's experiences within our state, and not just a few.  As a Spanish speaker, I would be one (or hopefully one more?) person on the commission who could reach and communicate with a portion of our population in this state that is often underrepresented.  I also believe that at my core, I have dedicated the bulk of my life to being a problem-solver, to working with all people, and to bettering myself through my education and then sharing this education by helping to educate others.  I believe that these are all skills that would work to the benefit of the commission.","Most of my adult life has been spent raising my family and teaching languages.  I have experience teaching in many different levels -- middle school, high school (including a local alternative school that serves low-income and struggling students), community college and university.  As such, I have had limited time to participate in groups, organizations or associations outside of my sphere of influence.  As a full-time teacher, I have belonged to professional organizations as well as committees within my school district and within my school.  It is within this sphere of influence that I have been most active.  I have led school-level and district-level professional developments, participated in district-wide cohorts, and engaged in committees at the school-level and district-level that advocate for student rights and teacher rights.  As a teacher, I believe that my profession is inherently linked to civil rights and justice in our society, through reflective teaching and guiding our children to think critically about the world they live in. As a teacher, I have dedicated my career towards bringing awareness to underrepresented populations - in particular, second language learners, low-income students, LGBTQ students, and students who don’t feel that they are able to succeed.  As a world language teacher, my life has been dedicated to not only teaching vocabulary and grammar, but also teaching students about how different customs of living, linguistic diversity and social norms influence our own outlook on the world.  At the core of my belief system, I believe that despite these differences, we care about the same problems the world presents us with, and we have the same hopes and dreams for our loved ones.  When we are able to bridge opposing viewpoints, we are able to make progress in our country.","I am a member of Colorado Conference of Foreign Language Teachers (CCFLT) and American Association of Teachers of French (AATF) and American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese (AATSP).  As a member of my school district's union (BVEA) and a building association representative, I have been trained in consensus-building strategies and have worked towards fair practices and positive communication strategies at my building level.","Before I became a teacher, I considered becoming a lawyer.  At this early point in my life, I was faced with the crossroads of choosing one career over the other.  I took the LSAT and applied to law schools at the same time that I applied to graduate schools to study Spanish Literature.  I scored very well on the LSAT (95th percentile), which has a large focus on analytical reasoning, and believe that I would have made a decent lawyer because of my ability to analyze problems from different perspectives.  Instead, I studied for my M.A. and pursued a career as a public school teacher. I have never regretted my decision; I am confronted with an equal number of problems in my chosen profession that I get to seek solutions to on a daily basis (to be fair -- probably far more than if I’d been a lawyer!).  I have honed my problem-solving skills while dealing with the multitude of challenges that teachers face regularly: reaching difficult students; supporting students in emotional need; brainstorming creative ways to present ideas; planning for five different classes a day within 45-minute planning periods; working with limited resources (i.e., no textbooks, spotty technology); interpreting data in order to create a data-driven teaching practice; working in a technology-driven environment (with a sometimes lacking of technology available to students); collaborating in departments with challenging colleagues; working in schools with (sometimes) challenging leaders; etc.  As you can imagine, the list goes on and on.  Every day is a choice to bring myself physically to work for 8-12 hours a day, and to do the best job that I can, in a limited amount of time, with limited resources.  I simply confront problems with a problem-solving mentality, a smile and a positive and friendly attitude, and I work through them in the best way that I can ... and I return and repeat the next day. I would bring the same dedication to problem-solving to my work on this commission.","As an unaffiliated voter, I have spent my life listening to various perspectives in order to keep an open mind and be accepting of all kinds of people.  As a public school teacher, I have spent my life working to educate students and bridge divides in an empathetic manner.  I firmly believe that it's important for people in positions of authority to maintain impartiality; perhaps I do not always agree with the politics of my students or my students' families, but they always deserve to have me (as their teacher) treat them fairly and without partiality in my classroom.  I do have a strong belief system that focuses on women's rights, the future world we are leaving our children, the voting rights that all citizens have;  however, I do not think any of these beliefs make me partisan or partial -- indeed, all of these concerns should be bipartisan and impartial, as they impact everybody.  I've always thought that our societal and global problems are bipartisan; it's the solutions that people turn to that make them partisan.  In the commission, I would strive to be a problem-solver that involves all voices at the table, and all citizens within the state, while striving towards bipartisan solutions.  Also, because my perspective intrinsically is linked to my personal life experiences of being a native of Colorado, but also having lived as a foreigner in other countries, and as an English-speaker who has striven to put herself out of her own realm of experiences in order to become fluent in two other languages, I have a unique perspective with a focus on diversity that I can share with the rest of the commission.","As a native Coloradan, I have voted in every Colorado state and national election since I was 18 years old and consider it a great honor to be able to use my voice in the democratic process.  Since 2015, I have not participated in any campaign as a volunteer, though I have donated money to the campaigns of Hilary Clinton, Joe Biden, and a few political organizations like ActBlue.  Though my political affiliations have recently tended to sway left, I remain unaffiliated as I prefer to keep an open mind and I also view principled conservatism as a cornerstone of our nation's identity.  Since 2015, though I have made these, I remain committed to listening to both sides in a nonpartisan effort to value everybody's opinions, as I believe that all political beliefs have some validity and everybody's voice deserves to be heard.  In the end, every citizen must make a final choice when it comes to voting, and each vote should be represented fairly.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/congressional_applicants/945

I tend to think strategically, which I've found to be a valuable trait when group dynamics lead us into the weeds. With any system, it’s useful to evaluate outcomes and weigh them against intentions, then to examine inputs and processes that produced them.","Having lived and worked in five distinct regions of the state (Northern and Southern Front Range, Eastern Plains, Western Slope, and the San Luis Valley), I’m receptive to the concerns of a broad range of eligible voters.

It seeks to avoid hardened positions, parliamentary manipulation, and predetermined outcomes. It take some diplomacy to practice this skill in a group that's unfamiliar with it, but it can be a very productive approach to develop shared vision and unified action. Adversarial intransigence is unhelpful regardless of the source, and must be recognized as such and negotiated with perseverance, mutual respect and moderate language, even as we navigate the complexities of power and representation.","I don’t engage in or support partisan political activity or any candidate.

Certificate in Medical Interpreting.,"Ever since I researched the subject of redistricting and read a book about it, I became aware how important it is that every American’s vote is counted. I have found that one way to disenfranchise a voter’s right to be equally represented is through the unfair drawing of lines along the districts on a map. Example: if you have knowledge of where the minority population resides on a map and you want to keep them from winning the election, you can exert your power by redrawing the lines in a way to keep the minority from winning an election, thereby disenfranchising their right to have their voice heard.

This is what drives me to serve on the commission.  I am a Navajo Indian; I am unique and come from a population that is underserved and underrepresented.  I believe that my input from a diverse perspective is valuable because I would like to make sure people of my race and other minority population have an equal voice through fair mapping.   

My experiences in the community as Vice President of Morgan County Democrats and my background of volunteer work only enhance my drive to serve to make a difference as a member of the redistricting commission.","I can think of a lot of things as an answer to this question, but I would like to focus on my experience advocating, organizing and representing, as a member and acting as the Vice-Chairman of Morgan County Democrats in Colorado. 

When I moved to Fort Morgan, Colorado a few years ago, I found that the Democratic Party was a minority in the community.  Most residents of Fort Morgan belonged to the Republican Party.  As a result, the Democrats felt oppressed. As a leader, I found that this made it difficult for me to get things done.  

Just to place a sign out in the street was risky for fear that the signs would be vandalized. And it did happen. The signs that we placed on the street were immediately vandalized several times.  

Few people wanted to work with us because we were Democrats.  It was difficult to just locate a venue to host an event in the community.  To rent an office to hold our monthly meeting was an enormous task because organizations refused to rent to us.  

Organizing a float in the 4th of July in order to be visible in the community was unheard of.  Few members of the Morgan County Democrats wanted to even ride in the parade for fear of not only ridicule, but the possible physical harm that may come to them. Few wanted to take these risks. The first time we constructed a float, decorated it with huge banners with huge letters of MORGAN COUNTY DEMOCRATS and rode on it in the 4th of July parade, some people ran out in the streets and threw objects at us. Children sprayed water directly on us. But we survived it.  Those people in the audience, who had secretly claimed to be Democrats, were initially apprehensive to cheer and clap for us.  But I noticed that they slowly came around over the years. Each year they saw our Party in the parade, more of them came out to cheer, voicing their appreciation.  

Losing a job was a concern for the members of our organization. They did not want to deal with the repercussions of being revealed that they supported the Democratic Party at their workplace.  I experienced this myself.  I kept a low profile at work.  In this way I identified with the members’ oppressed feelings.  Some must have lost their jobs before I came on the scene.  

Election time seemed to be a stressful time.  Door-knocking was an insurmountable task. No one dared to knock on doors the first year I came to Fort Morgan.   I personally, alone, had to go knock on doors to get the vote out.  Gradually over the years, I got a few more people to muster enough courage to knock on doors with me.  What helped were the stories I wrote up about my experiences knocking on doors and I emailed these to the members of the Democratic Party in the county.  Slowly, more and more people became willing to knock on doors with me. 

With this backdrop of the circumstances, I felt that I had to advocate for who I am and on behalf of my party, not only to the community of Fort Morgan, but to the members themselves in the monthly meetings. There was tremendous discrimination and prejudice against the Democrats in Morgan County. Everything that we valued as a party, like gay rights, women’s right to choose, immigration rights, labor rights, environmental protection values, was held against us.  

Therefore, it took a lot of courage, determination, persistence, and the energy to change the minds of the people.  This I experienced while I organized and represented the Democrats and advocated for them in their community as well as within their own party.","Throughout the summer of 2020, I volunteered by phone and internet for the Navajo Hopi Covid-19 Relief Fund, reaching out to those native people who were affected by Coronavirus. Many lived in the remote areas of the Navajo and Hopi reservations without running water or electricity. A toll-free telephone number was set up where members of their families could call and reach a virtual volunteer, like myself, who took a list of needs like food, water, medical, transportation and cleaning supplies and passed this list on to the ground volunteers who supplied these needs. This was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.  

Since 2015, I have also volunteered for other events like the Thanksgiving dinner for the homeless at the Rise Up Center through the Community of Christ church.

I have participated in the weekly bible study through the Lutheran Church of Our Redeemer.
I have also participated in a different bi-weekly men’s bible study in the Fort Morgan community which included various religious groups.

In 2019, I marched with in annual gay pride parade with Xcel Energy Company.  
Since 2015, I have also volunteered with Xcel Energy to clean up the Barr Lake State Park in Brighton, CO. 

Please note that other organizations that I have volunteered for, or was a member of, prior to 2015, are as follows:

When a borrower comes to me for financing, I am required to use all these skills to determine if the borrower will be capable of repaying the money he hopes to obtain.  As the loan officer or mortgage broker, I am the first gatekeeper towards the borrower’s path to obtaining a loan. After analyzing the borrower’s liabilities and assets, I have a duty to make a wise judgment as to whether the loan will close.  This involves gathering data to reveal the picture of the borrower.  I am obligated to input the data accurately into my calculations and verify that the borrower has sufficient income, stable job history, and sufficient reserves to sustain the monthly payment.  I have to determine whether the borrower has the appropriate debt ratio, which is the amount of debt analyzed against the income.  Investigating, verifying, and checking for accuracy are all part of forming the true picture of the borrower. If there are blemishes in the credit history of the borrower, I have the responsibility to determine how the negative credit will impact the borrower’s ability to repay the loan.  Here, my ability to communicate is essential; I am required to draw the information out of the borrower to determine if the bad credit is due to consistent negligence or a one-time event that was beyond the control of the borrower. 

When the case is extremely difficult, I am forced to collaborate with my fellow-loan officers and supervisor to see if the deal is too risky or if we can creatively do the financing. An example is if the property falls within a fine-line definition of real property. Real property is one that is affixed to land.  As a mortgage lender, the only properties I can finance are those that fall within this definition of real property. A questionable type of property is a modular home which used to be a movable property but has since been converted to a property that would be attached to land. The investors who ultimately put up the money to finance the deal may bring up this question at the last minute of closing and the property could be rejected. A good loan officer has this foresight and avoids this probability beforehand.  

Being at the forefront where everything hinges on how well I reveal the true picture of the borrower and how extensive my knowledge is of the loan products are essential as to whether the investor will profit or lose money on the deal of financing a borrower’s request.  How well I have used my analytical skills and how well I have applied my logic and reasoning to solve the initial problems involved in approving a loan will determine the end result of the investment.","As president of a Native American organization, I had a rare opportunity to lead a people that came from two diverse religious beliefs.  One group was of the Christian faith and this group consisted of urban Indians coming from the city lifestyle.  The other group was of the traditional Native American religion which came in from the reservation areas.   I was tempted to cater to one group which had similar beliefs to mine.  But I had to overlook my established way of thinking and become empathetic to those who believed differently than me.  I also noticed that it was easy for one group to turn against the other because they felt, albeit unsubstantiated, there was favoritism demonstrated against them. An example of the diverse of beliefs was how they felt about gay members of the group.  The Christians did not feel that assistance should easily be given to the gay members of the group while the traditional natives had more compassion and respect for the gay members. Though it was a challenge, I had to be fair and impartial. I brought these groups together by promoting consensus by first allowing the members to introduce themselves and to share something unique about themselves.  An important characteristic about the gay members was that they were very artistic.  Most had a talent to perform or to decorate.  This came in very handy when we decided to build a float for an annual parade that had a historical significance to the Native American community.  Our float was featured on television because we brought Native American dancers together to perform on the float.  The Native American motif and design was unique and outstanding.  What resulted from this event was the new respect the gay members gained.  There was a better understanding between the groups and a respect for their diverse uniqueness of the members.  The conservative group became more empathetic to the gay group as well as the traditional native group.  They all started to get along and a much better cohesiveness was created.  As a result, the ability to collaborate on new projects were more easily achieved.

From experiences like this, I feel that I can contribute to the redistricting commission by listening to the different perspectives and points of view, thereby be impartial and  promote consensus among the commissioners.","Most of my past political activity has been with the Morgan County Democratic Party.  I led the way to knocking on doors for the Hillary Clinton campaign.  I made calls to voters.  I spent all day on election day contacting those voters who had not yet voted and following up on those who had not responded by visiting their homes in order to make sure that every voter had voted.  I would like to think that due to my efforts, I have contributed to the victory of Hillary Clinton in the state of Colorado.  

Before the Hillary Clinton elections, I helped Barack Obama win Colorado.  I was fortunate to win the Northeastern CO campaign for the volunteer who had gone the extra mile of knocking on doors and calling on voters.  The winner would have his picture taken with Vice President Joe Biden.  I was so excited to meet and pose in a photo with VP Joe Biden. 

I have been very active with the Morgan County Democratic Party ever since I came to Fort Morgan 14 years ago.  I volunteered to head committees to organize dinners, like our annual Big-Ten dinner, as well as the fall and Christmas dinners.  The task of organizing and planning involved a wide range of tasks.  We had to find a proper venue equipped with a kitchen and a facility to hold enough people for the event.  If the event was a potluck dinner, we had to make sure people brought enough food.   We had to come up with a theme and design an agenda.  We had to solicit help to decorate the venue and clean up the location.  Places that had no sound system was an extra task to find someone to provide a sound system.  Providing entertainment for the dinner involved the task of soliciting musical groups to perform at the event.  In order to run an event according to schedule, it was important to follow up with the speakers and presenters to make sure they had all the information they needed so they could arrive on time.  Finally, one of the most important part of organizing an event was to plan a fund-raising project, like an auction during the dinner, that would be lucrative for the Party. 

Community exposure was one of my objectives as a leader.  I wanted the public to know who we were and what we stood for.  I wanted to make the public feel welcome to our center.  With that in mind, I reached out by introducing myself and the Party whenever events came about in the community.  I made small presentations about our monthly meetings, our frequent get-togethers including dinners and parties and made the public feel at ease with us and helped them realize that we had a lot of positive things to offer.  

I donated $35 dollar every year for the Big-Ten dinners since 2015.  I also donated $30 each to 3 candidates since that time.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/1123

Part of the good in the world is assuring that all citizens in Colorado have a voice and are represented in their vote via fair voting maps.  As an unaffiliated voter, and a fluent speaker of three languages, I firmly believe that people on the commission should represent and be able to try to connect to everyone's experiences within our state, and not just a few.  As a Spanish speaker, I would be one (or hopefully one more?) person on the commission who could reach and communicate with a portion of our population in this state that is often underrepresented.  I also believe that at my core, I have dedicated the bulk of my life to being a problem-solver, to working with all people, and to bettering myself through my education and then sharing this education by helping to educate others.  I believe that these are all skills that would work to the benefit of the commission.","Most of my adult life has been spent raising my family and teaching languages.  I have experience teaching in many different levels -- middle school, high school (including a local alternative school that serves low-income and struggling students), community college and university.  As such, I have had limited time to participate in groups, organizations or associations outside of my sphere of influence.  As a full-time teacher, I have belonged to professional organizations as well as committees within my school district and within my school.  It is within this sphere of influence that I have been most active.  I have led school-level and district-level professional developments, participated in district-wide cohorts, and engaged in committees at the school-level and district-level that advocate for student rights and teacher rights.  As a teacher, I believe that my profession is inherently linked to civil rights and justice in our society, through reflective teaching and guiding our children to think critically about the world they live in. As a teacher, I have dedicated my career towards bringing awareness to underrepresented populations - in particular, second language learners, low-income students, LGBTQ students, and students who don’t feel that they are able to succeed.  As a world language teacher, my life has been dedicated to not only teaching vocabulary and grammar, but also teaching students about how different customs of living, linguistic diversity and social norms influence our own outlook on the world.  At the core of my belief system, I believe that despite these differences, we care about the same problems the world presents us with, and we have the same hopes and dreams for our loved ones.  When we are able to bridge opposing viewpoints, we are able to make progress in our country.","I am a member of Colorado Conference of Foreign Language Teachers (CCFLT) and American Association of Teachers of French (AATF) and American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese (AATSP).  As a member of my school district's union (BVEA) and a building association representative, I have been trained in consensus-building strategies and have worked towards fair practices and positive communication strategies at my building level.","Before I became a teacher, I considered becoming a lawyer.  At this early point in my life, I was faced with the crossroads of choosing one career over the other.  I took the LSAT and applied to law schools at the same time that I applied to graduate schools to study Spanish Literature.  I scored very well on the LSAT (95th percentile), which has a large focus on analytical reasoning, and believe that I would have made a decent lawyer because of my ability to analyze problems from different perspectives.  Instead, I studied for my M.A. and pursued a career as a public school teacher. I have never regretted my decision; I am confronted with an equal number of problems in my chosen profession that I get to seek solutions to on a daily basis (to be fair -- probably far more than if I’d been a lawyer!).  I have honed my problem-solving skills while dealing with the multitude of challenges that teachers face regularly: reaching difficult students; supporting students in emotional need; brainstorming creative ways to present ideas; planning for five different classes a day within 45-minute planning periods; working with limited resources (i.e., no textbooks, spotty technology); interpreting data in order to create a data-driven teaching practice; working in a technology-driven environment (with a sometimes lacking of technology available to students); collaborating in departments with challenging colleagues; working in schools with (sometimes) challenging leaders; etc.  As you can imagine, the list goes on and on.  Every day is a choice to bring myself physically to work for 8-12 hours a day, and to do the best job that I can, in a limited amount of time, with limited resources.  I simply confront problems with a problem-solving mentality, a smile and a positive and friendly attitude, and I work through them in the best way that I can ... and I return and repeat the next day. I would bring the same dedication to problem-solving to my work on this commission.","As an unaffiliated voter, I have spent my life listening to various perspectives in order to keep an open mind and be accepting of all kinds of people.  As a public school teacher, I have spent my life working to educate students and bridge divides in an empathetic manner.  I firmly believe that it's important for people in positions of authority to maintain impartiality; perhaps I do not always agree with the politics of my students or my students' families, but they always deserve to have me (as their teacher) treat them fairly and without partiality in my classroom.  I do have a strong belief system that focuses on women's rights, the future world we are leaving our children, the voting rights that all citizens have;  however, I do not think any of these beliefs make me partisan or partial -- indeed, all of these concerns should be bipartisan and impartial, as they impact everybody.  I've always thought that our societal and global problems are bipartisan; it's the solutions that people turn to that make them partisan.  In the commission, I would strive to be a problem-solver that involves all voices at the table, and all citizens within the state, while striving towards bipartisan solutions.  Also, because my perspective intrinsically is linked to my personal life experiences of being a native of Colorado, but also having lived as a foreigner in other countries, and as an English-speaker who has striven to put herself out of her own realm of experiences in order to become fluent in two other languages, I have a unique perspective with a focus on diversity that I can share with the rest of the commission.","As a native Coloradan, I have voted in every Colorado state and national election since I was 18 years old and consider it a great honor to be able to use my voice in the democratic process.  Since 2015, I have not participated in any campaign as a volunteer, though I have donated money to the campaigns of Hilary Clinton, Joe Biden, and a few political organizations like ActBlue.  Though my political affiliations have recently tended to sway left, I remain unaffiliated as I prefer to keep an open mind and I also view principled conservatism as a cornerstone of our nation's identity.  Since 2015, though I have made these, I remain committed to listening to both sides in a nonpartisan effort to value everybody's opinions, as I believe that all political beliefs have some validity and everybody's voice deserves to be heard.  In the end, every citizen must make a final choice when it comes to voting, and each vote should be represented fairly.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/946

Problems can arise from all sorts of angles and it’s my job to anticipate and mitigate those potential issues. In my brewing career, problems were often more acute and required immediate, effective action to resolve. There is little time to deliberate when an enormous tank is leaking, and so I developed a quick response time to problems that does not compromise the effectiveness of the solution. In my academic training, I built a foundation of logical and reasoned analysis since the field of chemistry tolerates no other type of analysis. In my leisure time, I’m always eager to learn a new board game or puzzle because they help me think about strategic problem solving in a new light. Tasks like the Commission’s are a good fit for me.","I have found success throughout my personal and professional life in guiding meetings and conversations to a place that promotes consensus. I once managed a 30-person team of graduate student volunteers, which is a fragile coalition to hold together since students always have competing interests for their time and, being volunteers, I could offer them no material incentives. I was ultimately able to keep the group engaged, and on this and other teams I have relied upon a few key building blocks to set the stage for productive collaboration.


First, confirm goals and check assumptions. Do we have a common understanding of our purpose? Are there facts we all recognize? Many disagreements can be forestalled by establishing a baseline of goals and information that the entire group accepts.


Second, match outcomes to goals. What does success look like? Does this hypothetical result comport with our mission? Why or why not? Holding up possible outcomes for consideration helps ground the group in the reality of their decisions.


Third, connect actions to outcomes. If we take this step, will it lead to the result we want? The result that we agree will help achieve our goals? Actions can be more easily agreed upon if their connections to prior points of consensus are made clear; it is also important to deliberately give proposed actions a reality check for unintended consequences.


Half the battle (at least) of gathering consensus from a diverse group lies in simply avoiding derailment, since tangents constantly threaten to intrude and have a tendency to build their own momentum once instigated. Furthermore, it is crucial to follow good evidence wherever it leads and to be an active listener who strives to hear the truth in the experiences of one’s peers. These steps, attitude, and adherence to evidence are crucial ingredients for impartiality and consensus-building, and I believe a good process leads to good outcomes. While a harmonious ending is never guaranteed, these factors maintain a focus on the right questions and lead to the right conversations. I will strive to foster this collaborative process on the Commission.","Small amounts (<$150) to:

During my time at CDC, I was routinely called upon for special assignments – establishing high-profile programs, leading rapid decision-making units during pandemics, rescuing and rehabilitating programs decimated by political budget cuts. After retirement, I committed to myself that I would use those skills and that passion to help find solutions in my own community and state, rather than just at the Federal government level. I have long been interested in Congressional processes. During my time at CDC, I had the privilege to meet regularly with members of Congress and their staffs to educate them about our programs and answer their questions. I love the idea of democratic representation and finding ways to make that representation really work. Spending the bulk of my career living in a state that was heavily gerrymandered (Georgia) was exceptionally frustrating and something I vowed to take seriously when I was free of the Hatch Act restrictions I was placed under as a Federal uniformed services officer. When I retired and moved to Colorado in 2016, I knew I was moving to a state with many fewer Congressional districts, and that the population size and distribution was the largest determinant of how those districts are structured. The degrees of freedom for creating districts are extremely limited because of this. But the issues facing voters in CO-3 – one of the largest geographical districts in the nation with a relatively small population – must be considered and forcefully advocated for during the redistricting analysis and decision-making. I want to represent that perspective while also recognizing that the commission must make the best decisions for the good of the entire state. I want to apply my analytic, strategic, and negotiation skills to this big, difficult challenge to help the commission succeed in its work.","Upon moving to Colorado, I became an active member of 4 volunteer music organizations – the Cowboy Corral, Symphony in the Valley, the Aspen Choral Society, and High Country Sinfonia. In each, my goal was to serve as an outstanding musical contributor. With Aspen Choral Society and High Country Sinfonia, I quickly became more deeply involved in the organizational and business aspects through appointments to the Boards of Directors. I joined the Board of the Aspen Choral Society at a time when many important organizational changes were occurring. I quickly recognized that the Board would benefit from having the bylaws updated and a more aggressive public relations and fundraising posture. I led the revision of the bylaws, facilitated the entire board in reviewing and discussing options for important changes, identified a volunteer to serve as our general counsel for review and advice, and assisted the Board President with socializing and approving the new bylaws among the full board. I also worked closely with a public relations contractor to develop press releases and a more active social media presence. Behind the scenes, I provide guidance to the Board President based on my previous experience and training as a member of a board for a large national organization. High Country Sinfonia appointed me to their Board in 2020 to assist with their efforts to become a registered non-profit organization in the state of Colorado. That work is ongoing and draws from my experience developing the bylaws and procedures for Aspen Choral Society. My approach to organizing, representing, and advocating for both organizations is to serve the three “duties” of a board member – duty of care, duty of loyalty, and duty of obedience. My aim is to improve their business operations through careful shifts in policy and activity, while honoring the long local traditions of each organization and the deep relationships among and between the long-standing members, board members, and the community members who are our donors and audiences. A second way I actively consider the interests of Colorado organizations is my professional consulting work in public health and strategic planning. I have worked with several governmental organizations or associated entities within Pitkin County including the Board of County Commissioners, the Department of Public Health, the Aspen Pitkin County Housing Authority, and the Pitkin County Elected Officials Transportation Committee (including the Pitkin BoCC, the Aspen City Council, and the Snowmass Village Town Council). In each engagement, I have strived to build rapport, guide the group to a strategic solution, and identify and resolve areas of disagreement all while adhering to the parameters provided by the sponsor/client. This work has given me deep insight into the political structures, realities, and foibles of the government entities within one county and, critically, how those entities relate to their neighboring counties of the Roaring Fork Valley.","• American College of Preventive Medicine (a 501c3 national professional medical society, member since 1996; Fellow since 2004; Board of Regents President-Elect 2017-2019, President 2019-2021, CEO Search/Selection Committee Chair 2018) • US Public Health Service Commissioned Officers Association (member, 1991 - present) • Aspen Mountain View Homeowners Association (homeowner, 2016-present) • Aspen Choral Society (singer and member of the Board of Directors, 2017-present) • Eagle County CO Democrats (volunteer, 2020) • Symphony in the Valley (Glenwood Springs, CO, musician, 2016-2019) • High Country Sinfonia (Basalt, CO, musician 2017-present, board member 2020-present) • Valley Gardeners (Carbondale, CO, member 2017-present) • Cowboy Corral (singer, 2016-2019)","Medical and public health academic work and applied General Preventive Medicine and Public Health medical residency training all focus on analytic skills. I have an extensive background in conducting analytic studies documented by my publication record (see CV). As a supervisor and manager, I was also responsible for reviewing and approving analytic studies using numerous statistical data sets (including census data). In approaching problems of all kinds, I first look to the available data, seek other sources of information, and apply the strategic negotiation and planning skills described above to best analyze, generate options, and solve a problem.","In my facilitation and strategic planning work, I use several techniques to promote consensus. Chief among these is to ask questions to make sure I fully understand the perspective and contribution of the group members. I also make sure that I carefully draw out both the explicit and implicit criteria people are using to make decisions so that I can find areas where negotiation is possible. I always try to understand my own and others’ self-interests. I also work to reframe conflicts – what is it we already agree on? How can we use those points of agreement to find solutions to meet the enlarged interests of the group – in this case the entire state? When disagreement continues it is usually because the “right” solution has yet to be found. Being creative and drawing on the entire group’s creativity is key. And finally, I aim to always articulate how the group came to its recommendation or solution and what the criteria were. This contributes directly to communications that generate buy-in among stakeholders and so that each member of the commission can faithfully and enthusiastically promote the results of the work. My training as a scientist, manager and leader and my experience in the highly politicized environment of Federal public health instilled in me the need for fairness and impartiality. One cannot lead a team without being fair. Serving as the steward of a Federal budget requires one to be impartial. Federal procurement rules build fairness and impartiality directly into the systems within which I was trained. It is my instinct – through disposition and training – to make decisions based on facts, after considering the pros and cons of all the options, while making the decision criteria explicit, and with a deep understanding of how all stakeholders will feel about the decision. Finally, the most important aspect of promoting consensus and contributing to a fair, impartial and agreeable process is getting to know and appreciate the perspectives of my fellow commissioners. Learning about each other – including who we are and what we value – will be key to the commission’s success.","During a 25-year career as a Federal uniformed services medical officer (1991-2016), my political activity was limited due to Hatch Act restrictions. Following my retirement (September 1, 2016), I participated in house-to-house canvassing during the 2016 general election. During the 2018 election, I did a small amount of letter writing for the Diane Mitsch Bush campaign (CO-3). During 2020, I have participated in the Eagle County Democratic Caucus and as a district/state delegate in March, served as an Eagle County citizen election judge during the June primary, and briefly volunteered for and participated in one meeting of the Eagle County Democrats this summer. Because of ongoing public health consulting work related to the pandemic, I have not been able to continue my volunteer activities at this time. As I wind down these consulting activities, I plan to serve as a citizen election judge again for the general election in November. My husband and I jointly made small ($10-25) donations to the Hillary Clinton campaign (2016), the National Democratic Party (2018), and the 2018 and 2020 Diane Mitch Bush (CO-3) campaigns.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/789

I hope to be a Democratic member of the panel, but I believe I can be a fair and equitable participant in a team of commissioners working to make Colorado better. Today's politics have become so divisive -- and I think one of the main reasons is the 'cheating' of gerrymandered districts -- so we need to remove the conflict and actually listen to each other and think about the greater good. There are so many fronts where we need to address campaign reform (i.e. fundraising, unlimited spending by outside groups, etc.) but I believe that setting fair and representative districts is an important first step to creating a better campaign/election system.

I believe that every person running for office owes the voters a clear explanation of why they should be elected or re-elected.  That means creating districts that are competitive or more nearly competitive.  I think that is what the voters of Colorado voted for and why the commission exists.  I also very strongly believe in the power of cognitive diversity.  Challenges are overcome by leveraging the power of the different ways in which different people see the world, solve problems and make predictions.  Cognitive diversity is not the same as identity diversity (diversity based on race, gender, etc.), but it does correlate with it.  The challenge is to actually put cognitive diversity to work.  That's hard.  I've tried and both failed and succeeded as a VP with Boeing and with my own LLC here in Colorado.  It takes positive leadership to most effectively address problems and challenges, not directive-ship.  For example, extroverts are important to a good team (as important as introverts), but one extrovert, uncontrolled, can destroy the cognitive strength of a team.  I want to serve because I've spent well over a decade learning and understanding cognitive diversity and over fifty years as a leader, both in government and industry.  I want to help bring cognitive diversity to the challenge and to help leverage the diversity of the team.  I can be equally effective as a team member or as a team leader.","As a member of various Lafayette, Colorado, boards, committees and Councils, I have actively represented the interests of, those people that I consider pragmatists.  I take the position that it is all well and good to support lofty goals, but it is more important to support those goals that are actually achievable.  I have found that a common human failing is committing to some initiative without considering how the people involved in or affected by the initiative will actually respond to that initiative.  Human beings behave in ways that satisfy their personal goals and well being - not the ways in which councils, commissions, boards and legislatures want them to behave.  I participate in boards and commissions by encouraging my colleagues to engage in thorough discussions of the basic goal and how to achieve that goal. I don't believe in attacking or challenging the ideas of others, but I do believe in asking “why” and “how” questions to get to the very root of the idea and the potential ramifications and consequences of implementing it.  Why do we want to say/do that?  Does saying that commit us to some course of action?  If so, what?  How will we achieve such and such goal?  What are the measures that will help us understand whether or not we're making progress toward the goal?  What is the benefit to the citizens?  People are reasonable when they take the time to approach a task cognitively vs. intuitively   I believe that I am aligned with intent of the recent ballot initiative to re-draw Colorado’s legislative districts.  In redrawing Colorado’s legislative districts, it is vitally important to work from the basis that the goal is the creation of districts that are most fair to the voters in each of those districts – not to make the districts the same “size” or to ensure that they are homogeneous.  Competitive districts are fairer because candidates must actually engage voters and present their “platforms” and philosophies of government and allow the voters to choose.","Lafayette, CO Senior Advisory Board since 2018 Currently Vice Chairman

That meant having a working knowledge of probability and statistics as well as an understanding of the limits of sampling and extrapolation.  It also means having an appreciation for the power of analytic theories like Bayesian probability.  While I'm certainly no expert in Bayesian probability (or statistics), I understand the concepts, can work with them, and understand (most importantly) their limitations.  

As the Boeing VP for Analysis, Modeling, Simulation and Experimentation, I led a global team of analysts and successfully applied analysis to successfully win new business.  I had to both understand the analysts and to explain their findings and recommendations to the most senior levels of the Boeing company.","I have always strongly disliked the idea of consensus -- consensus is the answer that everyone can live with, and that's usually the “least bad” solution.  What we need to do is take ideas and proposals and leverage the cognitive diversity of the commission to build the best possible solution through a virtuous spiral of improvement.  Sounds like buzzwordism, but it isn't.  By listening to everyone's ideas AND understanding those ideas, it's not only possible but relatively painless to build good solutions.  A good redistricting solution is one under which candidates for office cannot rely on some ""base"" to get them elected, but one under which every candidate must go and listen to and understand his/her potential constituents.  They need to appreciate that they are interviewing for a job, not selling some preconceived ideas to the unwashed masses.

I'll promote the creation of agreement among the commissioners by actively listening to each commissioner's ideas and concerns, by asking questions to ensure that I do understand and then by working to leverage the best of each proposal to achieve the best possible solution rather than the “least bad” solution we can all live with.  Part of that is to help every commissioner understand the power of cognitive diversity and how the team can harness and use that diversity effectively.  

I believe that the best solutions are those that are arrived at through fact-supported processes of discussing and overcoming challenges.  I recognize that I, like all humans, am subject to biases -- biases that, once recognized, can be overcome.  Since the best solutions are achieved through the active participation of a cognitively diverse group, it is absolutely mandatory that the inputs and ideas of all members of the group be seriously considered, incorporating them when those inputs and ideas will improve the outcome.  To my mind, the outcome, in this case, should ensure that competitive voting districts will make it necessary for candidates to engage the voters and propose solid, logical platforms.  That can only be accomplished in an impartial manner.  Pushing a pre-conceived agenda on the populous is the antithesis of achieving the best outcome.","I have engaged in no political activity since November 10, 2015",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/208

I also completed the welding program at Pickens Technical School in Aurora, CO a long time ago (I was certified but it has lapsed).  I also maintain a CDL with tanker endorsement.","Quite simply, I want two things:  
1. I want rural Colorado to have more of a voice in Colorado politics and decision making.  I believe a thoughtful redistricting will help this.
2. I will be perfectly honest and say that I want to influence the districting.  I have no interest in political office, but I have been concerned at the direction things have taken of late and want to have a hand in shaping the future direction the state goes in.","My experience thus far has been mainly in contacting elected officials, unelected officials, and the media concerning issues that are of importance to me.  My main focus thus far has been in advocating for privacy rights and transparency in using cell phone data to track citizens' movements, advocating for having the (once the initial emergency has been cleared) Colorado Assembly decide how to respond to pandemics rather than one man in the Governor's chair, and advocating for the rural parts of the state to have more of a voice in Colorado government.  I contact people via phone, via email, and have begun using social media as a way to contact officials and to reach directly through to people using my Facebook group Colorado Accountability Project.  I am also trying to encourage others to get involved by contacting their elected officials.","Outside of being a registered Libertarian since I first started voting, I am not a member of any political organizations.  I am not a member of any civic organizations or community organizations either.  Outside of commitments at my work (which wold be mostly internal committees like the Human Resources Leadership Committee) I am not a member of any other associations","I am not sure how to take the word “analytical” in your question; i.e. I am not sure if you mean analytical in terms of the ability to understand and parse an argument or position, or whether you mean analytical in the mathematical/statistical sense.  In either case I feel that I am well suited in this regard.  I did not take the road into academia, but most of my education has been along that line and I regularly work on learning new things in physics (which requires the ability to understand and break down mathematical/logical arguments and the ability to apply math to them).  I will be honest and tell you that my knowledge of some higher level statistics concepts is incomplete, but I learn quickly and don’t anticipate a problem.
As regards the second part of your question, I do not feel as though I will have an issue applying logic and reasoning to a problem.  When you go to solve a problem in physics or mathematics (especially once you are beyond the level of memorizing a formula and into the areas of novel study) that’s exactly what you do.  Interestingly, it’s also what you do when trying to fix something (I’m working on restoring a track loader and help my dad in his semi restorations) though perhaps with less or a different form of math.  I feel as though I am well practiced in this regard.","I am glad I’m coming upon this question a few years after I got married, because I believe being married has greatly shifted (for the better) my perspective on reaching consensus among two people who have strongly-held, opposite opinions.  If you’re also married, I’m sure you understand as well.  My experience thus far has taught me that promoting consensus or agreement starts by recognizing that people of good will can disagree, and that someone else not seeing things the way I do doesn't make them ignorant or careless or etc.   Starting from that point, I think consensus building or compromise takes the form of outlining why you feel the way you do, what your goals are, outlining what you can't live with, and then finding areas of agreement.  For the things that you cannot agree on, you return to what you can't live with, and start saying what you'll tolerate.  I think keeping in mind that the essence of good compromise means that you (and all other parties) will be a little unhappy helps too.  It keeps you focused on what a reasonable outcome will look like.
I would like to say that I’m perfect in regard to being impartial, but I cannot.  Being fair to others, however, is a big value of mine.  In my experience as a teacher, I have had numerous times where I’ve had a student that I didn’t like, or one that sent a nasty email to my boss, or some such.  I have then had the chance to catch that student in a “gotcha” situation—a situation where they’d broken some minor rule or forgotten a homework or some such.  I cannot tell you how good it would have felt to bring the hammer down, but if I allow everyone else one free mistake, I must allow the troublesome students the same grace--difficult as it is.  That’s plain fairness.  It’s how I would want to be treated.  As another example, you may have been able to read between the lines thus far and know that I disagree vehemently with many things that Gov Polis and others have done.  Perhaps not, but let me know make it explicitly clear.  I disagree vehemently with many of the policy decisions and actions that Polis and others have undertaken.  In my Facebook group posts (Colorado Accountability Project—you’re welcome to go see), I do my best in posting to not step outside the truth and to be fair.  For example, in a recent post (recent as I write this on 8/13), I wrote some notes on Polis taking grant money to fund some of his political priorities.  The very first thing I wrote is that it’s not illegal and he has not been the first governor to do so","This one will be brief.  My political activity is mostly recent.  I have, of course, voted in every election since I was eligible and try to do my due diligence on informing myself of the initiatives and etc. on the ballot, but it wasn't until recently (actually it was Gov Polis emergency declaration and state shutdown that spurred it) that I became more actively involved.  I have not ever, and do not plan to ever, donate money to any campaign, candidate, or political organization.  I have, however, spent a great deal of time emailing and talking to both elected and unelected people in the areas of interest to me in an effort to influence and change what I have seen happening lately in Colorado.  I have also (because the response rate from officials and the media can be dishearteningly small) begun to create groups and use social media to expand my reach and to go directly to people.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/79

I want to make a difference for Colorado voters.  As Booker T. Washington noted, “Those who are happiest are those who do the most for others” 

And, what can we do for others that is more important than ensure Colorado’s voters are fairly represented in our state’s Congressional and state districts?  The doctrine—one person, one vote—requires that electoral districts be apportioned fairly and accurately.  The 2021 redistricting of Colorado is extremely important.  Our state’s population has grown over the last 10 years.  Based on new census data, Colorado could gain an addition seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.  That would expand our state’s influence in national politics and increase federal funding for state projects.  Redistricting also impacts representation of Colorado’s growing diversity.","When I arrived in Washington, DC, there were two women working in the government affairs area.  One worked for the railroads and the other was with the International Ladies’ Garment Workers of America.  Those of us being hired for similar positions had few mentors.  We needed direction.  Twelve of us in the food industry founded Women in Government Relations.  Monthly luncheons featured effective speakers who gave us confidence and professional guidance.  For example, Elizabeth Dole spoke at a luncheon when she was serving on the Federal Trade Commission.  We shared books on effective management.  Our first salary survey resulted in 15 women getting raises after they presented the data to their bosses and demonstrated they were underpaid.  My work with the Front Range Community College Foundation includes writing pieces some of which emphasize the importance of scholarships in graduating skilled employees who meet Colorado businesses’ needs and how important they are to the state’s economy.  I gave an endowment to the college for needed equipment for students enrolled in our new Center for Integrated Manufacturing programs.","Current:  Front Range Community College Foundation – Board, Executive Committee, Chair of the Communications Committee; National Marine Mammal Foundation – Board, Secretary, Chair of the Communications and Investment Committees; Women in Government Relations – retired/emeritus/one of the 12 founders of the group

You cannot successfully run a homeowners association without realistic budgeting and sufficient reserves for the future.  You cannot chair an Investment Committee without a Board-approved investment policy.  You cannot hire a new investment manager without a Request for Proposal.  You cannot look forward without thoughtful strategic planning.  No new challenge is unsurmountable.  You analyze.  You do research.  You learn.  You get it done.  While head of the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums, mediation was rarely needed.   But, a few situations demanded it.  A member was doing or saying something to the media that embarrassed another member.  Changing behavior and coming to an agreement takes patience, empathy, and persuasive skills.  
And, then there is communication.  A messaging strategy is the key to successfully marketing a business, a product, a political campaign, or a new concept, as well as effectively meeting both professional and personal goals and objectives.  The Front Range Community College Foundation depends on generous, caring donors to fund scholarships for needy students and capital improvements.  I draft many funding requests for Foundation staff to distribute.  The challenge is to understand your audience, analyze their motivations, and identify what has value and will motivate a potential donor to give.  This has been especially important during this pandemic, which caused students to lose their part-time jobs and their parents to lose their jobs and businesses.  The Foundation created a High Needs Fund for both students and adjunct instructors.  Many needed help, which required constant fundraising.  It was very rewarding when donors reacted positively and we could help so many students continue their educations.  One story we told often is that of a single mom who lost her job because of Covid.  She could no longer afford her apartment.  She moved in with her grandparents.  Because they are elderly, she could not search for another job, fearing if she brought the virus home they could die.  She needed help paying basic bills once she lost her income.  Booker T. Washington’s words ring very true when helping FRCC students reach for their dreams.","My Washington, DC, experiences and the various positions I held were centered on finding consensus among members of these organizations with different points of view and varying political perspectives.  I could not have succeeded without being fair and impartial.  I have never worked for any organization where I did not discuss issues with a team in the course of making a decision.  It varied from working with the Board to working with members of a committee.  Yes, I analyzed the issue, researched it, and crafted a recommendation.  But, it was only through consensus that a decision was reached.  Cognitive empathy is essential in coming to any agreement.  Active listening is effective.  It requires listening attentively and paraphrasing what has been said in any response, underscoring that you have heard and understand the point being made by another team member.  I socialize monthly with a neighbor who supports the opposite political party.  I bring up many, many subjects for discussion on which I know we can agree as caring women.  It underscores that we all have more we can agree on than disagree on in this sadly divisive time.","I was a volunteer in Dianne Primavera’s last campaigns for election and reelection to Colorado’s House of Representatives.

Starting in electronics, communications/rf, systems engineer & repair,  leading to networking, and computer repair. In all cases solutions to problems had to fit the conditions -- you can't fake data to solve a problem.  Research often solved problems (similar problems, or seemingly similar problems often lead to accurate answers).  Sometimes you found out that you didn't have enough information; I couldn't be afraid to ask for additional resources when potential solutions didn't work, or results didn't meet expectations.  In other words, sometimes you have to start over, as the apparent scope of the problem didn't fit the results.  It happened occasionally -- let your customer know that a problem remained unresolved and add additional resources to the data gathering (where often information about prior work changed the resulting efforts).   As well as add additional 3rd party technical expertise (more finite analysis of the symptoms).    With my business it isn't much different.  If a customer wants some work done I am not particularly familiar with, I research the request:  process, materials, tooling, time required, ability to master the techniques in a timely matter; will it be financially worth it to do the work (do I expect to do it again, not make as much margin; will the first customer be willing to pay enough to do the work, etc).

As an active community member in various Denver and Boulder county neighborhoods, schools, and Jewish community organizations across Colorado, I have a unique perspective on working with many different sectors of our Colorado community which I believe would greatly contribute to the commission's work.","I moved to Colorado to run the Office of Sustainability for the Denver Mayor in 2017. In this role, I worked across government departments and in collaboration with Denver neighborhoods to improve natural resource conservation measures. I represented the City and County of Denver to the broader community and among other municipal governments across the country working toward similar goals. 
 
For three years, I organized a coalition of 40 Colorado Jewish organizations, working to represent the broad Jewish community on local, state, and federal policy issues of relevance and impact to this Colorado constituency. 
 
On a neighborhood level, I organized monthly magazines for the residents of Denver's Hilltop and Lowry neighborhoods for four years, working closely with residents and neighborhood groups, to share news of interest to the community. That work led to playing a similar role for the Denver metro Realtor community, and I currently run this industry trade publication. My role is to help build relationships between top producing Realtors and local businesses that service the real estate industry. 
 
For the past two years, I have been an active parent at Eldorado PK-8, serving on the PTO and School Accountability Committee. When COVID jeopardized the 5th-grade commencement festivities, I organized a Netflix Movie Night for the 5th-grade class. I convened a group of parents to help set up the technology, design gift bags, and organized delivery of gift bags to each 5th-grade household. I am currently organizing a pandemic-friendly safe Halloween program for children in the Rock Creek neighborhood. My neighborhood involvement has also included advocacy work to prevent gun violence in our community and keep our children safe.","Cure Multiple Myeloma Corporation

I find it is always more effective to approach a disagreement among team members with respect and the ability to empathize with opposing views than to try to argue and intimidate others to get your way. In fact, I have been known in many situations as the team player who stays calm and is able to create agreement and effectively help reach consensus.","From 2001-2003, I served as a political campaign consultant in San Francisco for local and state candidates and ballot initiatives.

Especially with our ""first past the post"" system, dominated by two political parties, allowing voters the ability to pick their representatives (and not the other way around) is critical. I strongly believe that a large contributing factor to our current political extremes is due to parties controlling redistricting, almost guaranteeing their victory, which leads to politicians having to go further and further to extremes. If districts were created with voters in mind, it would likely help to act as a moderating effect on candidates. I have read with interest the research that has been done on trying to make districts fair and representative, instead of being created to enable single party dominance.","Since moving to Colorado in 2013, I have tried to learn as much about the state and the different populations that live here.

legislative,845,2020-10-15T22:53:20Z,David Gray,,Democrat,Male,m,Caucasian,False,81224,Retired,"Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Political Science, Michigan State University
 Masters of Public Policy, University of Michigan","I have a life long interest in government, public policy and politics.  As you can see from my resume I studied Political Science as an under graduated and received my masters degree in Public Policy.  In my first career I pursued these interests by working for a member of the US House of Representatives (William Ford, MI) and then by working on political campaigns for US House, State Senate and Governor.   
I was fortunate to work for a US House member during redistricting after the 1990 Census and witnessed first hand some of the inner workings of this process as well as seeing how critical district boundaries were in shaping the composition of future governments and ultimately influencing future public policy.    As a graduate student in Public Policy I was able to take a seminar on apportionment and redistricting and learn of some of the academic work around these subjects and some early proposals by academics to limit some of the partisan influences from the process (my favorite from the time was proposal that representatives from each political party would take turns drawing a single district boundary line on a redistricting map – the theory being that by forcing them to alternate turns each side would reduce the ability of either side to maximize the boundaries to their advantage).
I, like many of our fellow citizens (as demonstrated by the passage of the redistricting commission ballot initiative) have become concerned over the increasing bitterness in partisan politics over the last decade.  While I have strong opinions and beliefs over what is “good” policy and advocate for those positions (and the candidates who support them), I also recognize that others hold just as strongly held beliefs that differ sharply from my own.  As we have grown more polarized I have worried that our governing institutions have struggled to perform in ways that serve our common good.  I have come to agree with the position that a significant contributing factor to this polarization has been the process used to draw district boundaries for state and federal elections.  With the massive increase in availability of detailed data about the electorate (by every conceivable dimensions – age, gender, party affiliation, race, ethnicity, income, education, ……) combined the geospacial computing technology available to use this data, we really had reached the point where the party in power during redistricting can maximize their partisan advantages in unprecedented ways. While Colorado’s previous process what not nearly as bad as other states, it still led to may inequities in district boundaries that contributed to this problem.  
The creation of politically motivated boundaries lines resulted in far too many uncompetitive districts where one political party was almost assured of election. The only competitive elections in these districts where in primary elections, which often resulted in the election of candidates that take the most extreme partisan positions.
It is my strong hope that through the new redistricting commission Colorado will draw election boundaries that will result in as many competitive seats as possible, thus improving the opportunity for candidates who will have motivation to seek out solutions that represent that views of  citizens from across the political spectrum.",See answer below regarding promoting consensus,N/A  In my career as a healthcare consultant I traveled around the country on a regular basis which did not allow time for this type of volunteer activity,"In my career as a health care consultant I specialized in the use of data and analytics to drive strategy development and implementation.  I was privileged to work for some of the pioneering healthcare information companies (HCIA, Sachs Group, MedStat – which were eventually purchased by IBM Watson Healthcare) and develop a strong set of technical and analytical skills to use information to drive decision making.  At IBM I led a group of PhD data scientist, health care analysts and consultants to develop data driven solutions to some of the most challenging problems in the business of healthcare.  In this role we used the same type of data (demographical, education, income, location….) and geospacial technology that are used for redistricting.   I was responsible for leading and challenging this team to turn “data” and “analytics” into actionable information and insights to drive decision making processes.  Through this work I believe I have a strong foundation in the technology, analytics and logic required to develop districts that meet the criteria for determining congressional districts.","Prior to my retirement this past year I worked as a Strategy and Business Development consultant in the Health Care sector.  I this role I would often be hired by large health care systems to work across their organizations - with Board Members, Executives, Physicians, Front Line staff, Community members…. To develop a strategic vision and implementation plan for how an organization was to achieve their strategic goals.   In this role I would have to facilitate a process to bring diverse constituencies to a consensus on a common set of goals.  At the same time I was also responsible for providing my own inputs into this process – advising senior leaders on strategic options based on my industry observations and expertise.  I believe my years of professional experience in strategy and facilitation combined with my passionate believe in the objectives of the redistricting commission will allow me to contribute to a commission that would be able to arrive at a consensus for the good of the citizens of Colorado and not for any individual position or faction.","Early in my career I worked for a member of the U.S. Congress (William Ford, D - Michigan) as well as worked on campaigns for candidates for  for U.S. Congressional, State of Michigan Senate and State of Michigan Governor;

It is a critical element of our democracy and I find it sadly frustrating that so many people choose not to participate, and yet, still want their voices heard. After decades of discussions and study, I know that people fail to participate because they feel that their representatives don't listen or have their own agendas. I believe much of this attitude is the result of gerrymandering and it has caused great dissatisfaction among the voting population. All people want is for their vote to weigh equally with any other vote. Gerrymandering has inhibited fair elections in the US almost since our inception and it is simply time to put an end to the practice. It will encourage more people to participate and will result in more fairness in election results.

I continue to have relationships with many of the parents who either graduated from the program or participated in services during my years there. I often serve as a mentor and write letters of recommendation. As Executive Director I represented our organization at the Women's Foundation of Colorado in Denver, attending advocacy meetings and helping with research projects. I also coordinated services with other community based organizations here in Larimer County. During the years of Welfare Reform I was very active at the State and Local levels in advocating for families living in poverty. While Executive Director, I also served as Program Manager as we did not add that position until later. I expended a good deal of creative energy and networked extensively to establish programs for single parents like the Cars for Families program and special child care and scholarship funds. I sought out partners like the fleet services staff at Larimer County, the City of Fort Collins, and Aims Community College to arrange for volunteer car repair. I worked closely with local housing authorities to secure rent subsidies for families in the PS-S program. I developed quite a local and even statewide reputation and received a number of awards mentioned in my resume.","I have consistently been a volunteer for Project Self-Sufficiency of Loveland-Fort Collins since retiring from that organization in November 2014. I was Executive Director for 25 years. Since leaving employment there, I have continued on the Scholarship Committee and meet periodically with my successor as well as helping out with newsletter articles and special events. After leaving Project Self-Sufficiency, I worked for the Colorado State University School of Social Work for three years placing undergraduate and graduate level students into internships with organizations around the State. Since retiring from CSU, I have continued to serve as a volunteer Field Instructor for various Larimer County organizations accepting students. As recently as May 2020, I was the Field Instructor for two social work students at Alternatives to Violence in Loveland. I have been serving on the Board of Directors for the Sam S. Bloom Foundation (based out of Centennial, Colorado) for over six years and chair two committees. We distribute grants to nonprofit organizations around the State of Colorado. In recent months, I served on a Larimer County advisory committee distributing federal COVID funds to local organizations. We made recommendations after reviewing funding requests.  I have also volunteered with the City of Loveland, helping with resource distribution for people experiencing homelessness. The attached resume provides some additional information on my experience and service over the years.","I tend to be a cautious thinker, looking closely at the details in any situation, considering worst and best case scenarios, anticipating unintended consequences, and looking at the long term effects of decisions made now. I continue to marvel at the forethought New Yorkers exhibited when they created Central Park so many years ago. I like to do research and look at best practices to discover ideas and examples of what can work and under what circumstances. My mother was an amazing problem solver and could rig up the most fascinating solutions to a practical problem. I have tried to learn from her example. I look at common sense solutions as well as the spirit of the law.","My social work education and many years of experience have helped me build a skill set that would assist with this process. As a nonprofit leader, it has often been my goal and my role to build consensus by finding common interests and concerns among participating individuals and organizations. Digging deep to identify my own personal experiences that relate to the topic at hand, as well as helping others do the same, creates an opportunity to build consensus. Story telling and other real life examples of how people are affected is often an effective tool. It is important to see beyond the obvious and look for unintended consequences. I would listen to all points of view and differing opinions, especially coming from local communities and special populations that would be impacted. It is critical to consider diversity within populations, issues that bind communities together, and special circumstances experienced by varying communities. I am rather obsessive about fairness and go to great lengths to make sure a process is fair. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt while gathering more information. We each need to look at our own potential biases and rise above those. In my leadership role at Project Self-Sufficiency, I was known for my inclusive and demographic style of decision making. I worked closely with staff and board members, while also seeking input from program participants. While serving as an Election Judge for Larimer County in 2018, I worked side by side with Republicans and Unaffiliated coworkers to successfully review the status of individual voters at a polling place.","I am currently assisting with phone calling for the Harris-Biden Campaign and assisted Gordon McLaughlin for DA Eighth Judicial District with yard sign delivery. During the primary I helped gather signatures for Kim Akeley Charron for Larimer County Commissioner and for Lorena Garcia for US Senate. In prior years I have assisted with distribution of literature and phone calling for various campaigns. I attend all caucuses and in recent months I have participated in online townhalls and Democratic Party meetings over zoom and other web platforms. I am currently donating funds about once a month to 25 to 30 different local, statewide, and national campaigns usually at the $25 level and occasionally up to $75.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/652

I represented the northern metro communities in negotiations for the cleanup of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal in the 1990's.  That also involved balancing the interests of responsible parties, citizens, communities within the context of science and principles of public health protection. I served on three federal advisory committees charged with recommending revisions to federal environmental regulations (drinking water).  I was often the neutral voice that could bring disparate parties to a common and agreeable resolution of the problem.  Finally, I assisted the federal Agency For Toxic Substances and Disease Registry in 2 locations (Memphis, Tennessee and Cape Cod, Mass.) by mediating discussions toward resolution of disputes between the community and federal agencies relative to environmental contamination.

I believe that our Colorado representatives should represent constituents of similar local concerns and not be far removed from many constituents located in the far reaches of a gerrymandered district.  For instance, the SD2 map extends from far east side of Colorado Springs Airport then wraps around south of Colorado Springs and all the way to Idaho Springs, and SD25 extends from Thornton way out to Washington county.  I think we can do better. I think we can make fairer districts.  Colorado is a purple state that has had a tilt to either blue or red depending on the election in the last 25 years.  In most years, we should expect Colorado's 65 state house districts to have a 55%/45% split of major parties serving in the state House. In years, with significant sea changes or ""waves"" of one party preference, the split should be no more than 65%/35% split. I think our founding fathers intended some degree of stability in government that is insulated from huge emotional swings as well as an inherent competitive nature.

And while I don't believe that Colorado has a major Gerrymandering problem like other states do, I don't want Colorado to have such a problem in the future.

Additionally, as a resident of very rural Clear Creek County, I believe that I can bring a ""mountain perspective"" to the commission.

International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 357 (airline union)--union member (and previous executive board member)
Air Line Pilots Association--union member","My professional life consists of taking a packet of information (weather, aircraft mechanical state, airport conditions, terrain considerations, and in some cases geopolitical considerations) and distilling that information into a useable plan to accomplish a given task (to fly from point A to B). This involves the rest of the flight crew I am operating with (I have been a captain, first officer, and relief pilot at various times, all of which involve different leadership gradients), a dispatcher with joint responsibility, and many other entities during complex flights. All of this must end up with a consensus on how we should operate the flight. From the moment that plan is agreed to, it is continually monitored and re-evaluated, and adjusted should conditions warrant. All of this while weighing pros and cons, and operating under a continually ticking clock and continually depleting fuel reserves. In less time critical situations (which is how the commission would operate), I tend to prioritize a task by critical criteria, starting with what seems most pressing. Once prioritized, I seek to apply any desirable criteria--especially if I am working with others who might rank the criteria differently than I do. And once a workable plan appears to be presented, I seek ways to test that plan against the criteria, and adjust it if necessary.","I have spent over 10,000 hours flying airplanes, which is mostly an exercise in assessing information, and building consensus amongst the operating crew members, a skill that I have honed to a pretty high degree. I also served a term as an elected leader for a pilots union (IBT Local 357), during one of the most contentious bargaining environments in Railway Labor Act history. It was one of the driving factors for me running for that position, and I largely acted as the ""independent"" board member making peace between factions on our board. As part of my experience in union representation, I eventually developed the skills to handle EXTREMELY sensitive discussions (including high stakes discipline, substance abuse issues, harassment cases, hostile membership, and negotiations) respectfully amongst parties who typically displayed open disdain for one another. 

As a dyed in the wool independent, I would be unencumbered by partisan pressures entirely, while being naturally inclined towards consensus building as the most effective form of agreement. I operate in a world that requires a shared mental model and buy in of any decision in an airplane, it's a way of life for me, and has been for over 20 years in my professional life. I also like to think that I am really good at letting bygones be bygones. A disagreement with another person on one topic does not need to effect other attempts to build consensus with that person, and it is incredibly important to disagree without being disagreeable with one another. I basically cannot recall the last time I disagreed with someone I was working on the same task with--I believe because my skills at building a shared mental model lead to consensus so efficiently that things never rise to the level of a real disagreement. Impartiality is achieved both by my fierce non partisan belief and lifelong devotion to non partisanship, along with the inclusion of fairness and impartiality as critical criteria to work for. People are allowed to have their own beliefs (including partisan motivations that I might agree or disagree with), but that does not necessarily mean that their viewpoint is not valid and deserving of thoughtful consideration.","Represent.US

My husband and I moved to Colorado 20 years ago from Iowa where we had lived all our lives. Being able to move to Colorado was a dream come true. Finding Durango, was not what we anticipated, but it was just right for us.
But what we did not expect, was that our nightly television news would come from New Mexico, and that we would come to know more initially about Albuquerque than we would about Denver; more about New Mexico politics than we would about Colorado’s; and more about the government and the governor of New Mexico than we would about our newly adopted state’s. Especially in Election years it’s easy to feel overlooked and disconnected if you live in La Plata County. Over time, however, we’ve come to appreciate New Mexico, but we’ve had to make effort to know and find out about Colorado and what’s happening here, how things work here, and who our elected officials are. As a consequence, I think we have paid more attention and gotten more involved than we ever were previously.
We have always enjoyed getting out and exploring, and I think there may be a county in Colorado that we have not been in, but I’d have to look carefully to find it.
I think I am aware of the diversity of our very large state, and I am familiar with not only the geography of it’s various parts, but of the people and how they live and make their livelihoods; not only the Western Slope (which was a new concept and distinction to me), but the Front Range and Eastern Plains as well. I’ve acquainted myself with all parts of the state, maybe even more so than a native might, because we were transplants who wanted to be here, and to participate in this great state.
Being sure that each and every person is fairly represented is not an easy goal to attain, but I believe that it should done with as much fairness and convenience as possible, and I would pledge to do to the best of my ability, and be honored to be involved in the endeavor.

In addition, the entire curriculum reinforces the 'scientific method' for analysis and problem solving. This background has been reinforced in my role of running a technology services company. This has required objective and creative approaches to solve complex technology problems, working with people to take action and at the same time inspiring their dedication.  I am confident in my intellectual aptitude to analyze, understand and communicate the story that the data is suggesting. I would also lean on my experience leading and working with teams, and the strong listening and communication skills that I possess.","I would start with my ability to review information from a scientific and objective view.

I believe that I am a good listener but also have the ability to ask probing questions that help better define what the root issue or desire is. Learning as much as possible about an issue can make one appear fair or impartial but still negatively impact others who may not have representation. Just because a decision or process appears impartial on the surface does not mean it is fair in practice because existing conditions may not allow for true equality in an outcome. It will be interesting to see how decisions about fairness are implemented at a micro and macro level, and where the tradeoffs happen. Consensus has to be the goal from the beginning, not unanimity. Not everyone will be happy with all of the decisions that are made but I believe that a good map can be designed if members are willing to compromise.","In 1992 I worked on the Dick Lamm US Senate primary campaign and Pat Schroeder US House of Representatives general election campaign.

I believe individuals such as myself should volunteer to take the experience, training, and leadership learned over years of making people and systems work correctly and put those skills to use making the redistricting work for the citizens, not the politicized governmental establishment.

Who wouldn’t want to be part of that?","In addition to the GOP County Central Committee above, I have been active in the non-profit Rocky Mountain Wing (RMW) Commemorative Air Force (CAF) serving on the Wing Staff as both Education Officer and as the Wing Newsletter Editor. Accomplishments include implementing the CAF Rise Above program that has enabled 1,000's of Colorado Westen Slope middle school students to be exposed to and experience the dedication and determination put forth by our Greatest Generation during WWII. I also successfully campaigned to have the Wing's Grumman TBM Avenger Torpedo Bomber certified as both a Colorado State Historical Object and a National Historic Object (airplane), one of only two that regularly continue to fly. Even though somewhat inactive over the past few months, over several years I have written for and maintained a small blog where I've posted many, many letters I've written to Congressmen, Senators, and state officials regarding issues current at the time. The blog can be reached at www.flyingwblog.com.","Active Precinct Delegate to the Delta County Republican Central Committee. During this tenure served on various subcommittees. Also, a member of the American Legion, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, National Rifle Association, Commemorative Air Force.","In addition to my ""professional"" career interfacing with (reasoning with) executives and engineers at all levels, I also had a sideline career as a commercial pilot, expanding the use of my own personal business aircraft as a pilot for other commercial aircraft. I never considered flying these aircraft a ""profession"" but rather a diversion to hone both my mental skills as well as improve and maintain my piloting skills. Without question, piloting today's aircraft in ""the crowded skies"" requires logic and reasoning skills above the norm. Most piloting (with perhaps the exception of crop dusting)can be hours of boredom interspersed with moments of terror! Those moments of terror require logic and reasoning skills way beyond those necessary to put together a contract for a worldwide computer packet switching network. Operating within one environment compliments the other - I speak from experience in both cases. Gathering known reliable and meaningful data, using demonstrated means to analyze the data for information pertinent to the problem at hand, applying the information in acceptable means, and then making sound decisions based on the data - not other outside emotionally charged input - is the path to success - both in the cockpit and the boardroom. That same logic and decision path will serve the redistricting commission, and Colorado's diverse citizenship very well.","I spent my entire professional career negotiating - establishing consensus between groups and individuals. Yes, I was called a ""salesman"" or a ""manager."" I held titles such as Sales Engineer, District/Regional Sales Manager, Vice President of sales, and even ""Owner."" I've had to negotiate agreements between my employers and major airlines, Energy companies, State Governments, large manufacturing consortiums, Universities, Global Communications Carriers, etc., etc. I've been successful at applying logic and reason to the discussions and planning necessary to forge a successful outcome. Colorado's citizens deserve equal representation based upon their contribution to the State's success. Because I have lived and worked in both the metropolitan business arena (Denver area for 30 years) and rural Delta County (20 years) I actually know how much impartiality means in representation.",Small donations to Congressman Scott Tipton and local State House and Senate candidates.

This would include the studies and training in the role of economic and political factors in public decision-making and policy formulation; microeconomic analysis [econometrics]  of policy options and issues; their resource allocation and decision models; cost/benefit analysis; and statistical and research methods.,"As a state environmental and educational employee, I've always had to promote a consensus of the administration's pursuit to create a good, safe and clean learning environment.  Working in the public sector can provide either great satisfaction or disarray; as a representative of our government, I feel, it is my duty to assure a consensus is not just heard, but heeded, by our administrators.  If disarray is visualized or experienced, advocates should be supplied to counter or meet the disorganization/disagreement.   Consensus is achieved by finding the middle ground, ideas that meet both or all parties needs; then working toward a mutual agreement on those outliers, merging them or redefining them, possibly allowing a better consensus.  Being impartial can be difficult when it comes to meeting the demands and needs of children and the elderly, they are so vulnerable and require our steadfast and consistent support but their needs should not revoke or overshadow the needs and rights of our younger more vibrant portion of the community - our workforce.  Without our workers/drones, we'd not have a hive/community or a queen bee (leader) to serve.  Fairness is a subjective concept which was consistently taught to me, as I grew up in Denver, during the Civil Rights Movement era; attending parochial school where the Sisters bellowed the importance of integrity and measuring the variables in the discussion; to think of the consequences, before making a decision. And those lessons have been learned and put into action, many times over the years.","In COLORADO ONLY: 2020 - small donations to various Democratic Senate and State Representatives across the nation.   2019- Canvass for School Board candidates, Alexis Menocal Harrigan.  2018-  Canvass for Mike Johnston, for Governor; Diana DeGette, US House District 1. 1996-2000 volunteer at Dist.1 State Senator & Councilman's Community Office; canvass for various school board candidates.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/914

I am committed to my community for which I have lived at the same address for thirty-five years. My family lives on a small acreage in unincorporated Larimer County just outside of Berthoud. Living in this semi-rural area has made me sensitive to the concerns of people outside an urban area. I currently serve on the rural Land Use Board for Larimer County and wish to expand my involvement in the role government takes.  Nothing is more important than committing oneself in service to others. My commitment to this Commission would be to make sure the intentions of amendment Y and Z are respected and successfully carried out while making sure it is a fair process that represents Colorado.,"Many years ago, I was the President of a newly formed group in Colorado called the Colorado Association of Women Police (C.A.W.P.). Our focus was advocating for the interest of women in law enforcement mostly because there were less than 2% of women in law enforcement at the time.  My position in human resources was spent advocating for the individual and the City of Longmont at the same time to ensure both sides were treated fairly. Most recently I have been involved with a small working group through the PUC, that re-wrote the 911 Rules for Colorado and created new tariffs. In this role I am advocating for the public interest to ensure emergency communication systems operate as promised despite the conflicting interests of corporate and the private sector.","Cattail Women's Golf League Board, Loveland, Colorado    2020 to present

It felt like I was going to college and majoring in all the subjects. I was a key player in a multi-agency state of the art emergency 911 system that had all the human elements and political fallout that happens when multiple interests have to come to a consensus. These were complex technical projects like CAD  (Computer Aided Dispatch) systems, radio tower purchases, GIS implementation and phone systems. Some of these projects took years to work through all the nuances and details that were not always obvious.","I feel like my whole career has centered on being fair and impartial. Thirty-five years in public service means you answer to the public. My actions and words were always being scrutinized by individuals who expected honesty and fairness. The success I achieved was a measure of my ability to listen to both sides and make decision based on the law and my experience.  My varied experience in human resources, law enforcement and now the corporate setting exposed me to the world of consensus building.

I want to be active in crafting solutions that benefit Colorado voters statewide. I consider myself a life-long learner, a good listener, a team worker and a fair person.","My experience has been limited to my career as a public school educator. Within that role and responsibility I have organized groups of students, teachers, parents and community members for literacy programs, National Honor Society membership and initiatives, College Board activities and classes, and participation in National History Day competitions and judging.","Independent Voter, I was a member of the Denver Classroom Teachers Association prior to my retirement in 2016. A member of the Colorado Geographic Alliance and the American Library Association.","In achieving my Masters in Library and Information Science from the University of Denver in 2007 I had many opportunities to apply sophisticated analysis to situations and scenarios presented as part of my course work and in my subsequent employment as a librarian. From developing authentic collections and embracing the needs of diverse patrons to budget considerations within unique tax districts, the focus on analyzing data enabled me to chart a clear path for providing relevant and productive library service for all. My ability to apply logic and reason to a problem is perhaps best illustrated by my work as a reader for the College Board’s Advanced Placement United States History exam. As a reader, our job is to read and score (according to a pre-set rubric) student’s essays answering one topic question during a seven day session that begins each day at 8am and ends at 5pm. The same question over and over, but answered by high school students from all over the country (as well as those attending international schools). We each read hundreds of essays daily by students whose skill sets vary wildly. Our goal as readers is to award the students for what they know – not punish them for what they omit or get wrong. Many times logic dictates that the student answered the prompt correctly, looking at their writing holistically, and even though there might be minor errors in their writing. Reason takes that logic by the hand and reminds us as readers that the student wrote the essay in 45 minutes, under extreme pressure and without prior knowledge of the prompt. So when we spend the two to three minutes reading and scoring each essay we embrace that reason and logic and our goal to benefit the student’s effort is realized.","I will promote consensus by being patient in listening to all points of view expressed and by maintaining flexibility in my own opinions. I believe my career as a public school teacher has helped shape my skills in this regard. High School students share their thoughts and opinions about absolutely everything. An integral part of being a good teacher is listening to what they have to say without verbal or visual signs of judgement, and then working towards an answer, resolution or consideration. This skill was, and is, often tested when what is said clashes with my own ideas or realities. That is where the work gets more difficult and can be more rewarding. Often in committee meetings, parent conferences, as well as mentoring new teachers, the same patience and honest listening is needed. Especially in these challenging times, I have no doubt that building agreement with any diverse group of people will be difficult. I believe with my personal history and experience I am up to the task.","My past political activity has mostly involved teaching my high school Social Studies students about local, state, national government, civic participation and the U.S. Constitution. When applicable, I have encourage my senior students to register to vote. In line with district policy, I have always presented a non-partisan view in my teaching as well as in my professional profile. As a registered Independent voter I have been fortunate and honest in regarding the issues behind ballot measures and candidates, as opposed to being influenced along party lines. I vote given every opportunity not only because it is a privilege to do so, but also because I am answerable to my students as a person of responsibility and leadership. I have not consciously donated money to any political campaign or organization. I was a member of the teacher’s union DCTA and I withheld monies from them that were being directed politically.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/522

I was shocked and saddened how map manipulation in other states caused a distortion in their representation at the federal and state level.  I think this leads to voter disillusionment and a feeling that their votes do not matter.  One of the educational events held at my home was about Amendment Y and Z.  I have become more aware of the importance through All On The Line, which educates people about the importance of fair maps.  Voters need to pick their representatives at the federal and state level, not the other way around.","I completed the Organizing for Action Fellows program.  As part of the program, I organized an educational event on Climate Change at a library.

I developed a spreadsheet for use in our department that can track needed data and can pull information using pivot tables.","One of my earliest memories was going to pick up my grandmother on election day, she was an election judge.  Voting has always been important in my family, but I would not have considered myself “political”. My dad was involved in town council in Pine Haven Wyoming and my aunt was mayor of Pine Knoll Shores in North Carolina.  They both leaned Republican and many in my family still are Republicans. I aligned with the Democratic Party in 2008 because I wanted to help with the convention.  As I have become more involved, I more closely align with the Democratic platform, such as health care and environmental protections than with the traditional Republican platform of less government involvement and conservative social values. With my background, I have cultivated skills that have built fairness and impartially in my core values.
I struggle with the current administration and it is my hope that after November there will be an increased desire for people to work together for the common good.  We can begin this ideal by working together locally. A couple of years ago, I attended an event at the Denver Film Society in which one of the panelists was Eleanor Clift, a Washington journalist.  She proposed that the intense political division was created in part because people did not know each other at the personal level. She mentioned that Tip O’Neill and Reagan could be friends because they created opportunities to be together after work.  With today’s politicians leaving Washington as soon as work is over and not cultivating after work relationships, the camaraderie is lost.  I will suggest that the commission meet on a non-formal basis to cultivate relationships with each other.  If the group as whole chooses not to do this, I will reach out on a one-on-one basis to build camaraderie.","I have donated money to Steven Woodrow Colorado HD6, Diane Mitsch Bush CD3 and an organization called “Stop Republicans” through Act Blue.

Among other things, this means that district lines are not written in such a way to ensure a particular outcome, but rather that citizens in each district are given real choice with candidates that attend to the needs and interests of the population.  Second, I am a strong believer in shared community responsibility.  While it is easy to criticize the decisions of others, we often forget how difficult it is to shoulder the decisions.  I offer my time and effort to share that responsibility.","I have concentrated my efforts on addressing environmental issues and community support.  These are issues I take a hands-on approach to through my volunteer activities and then focus on through my classes (regularly teaching an upper division course at CU Boulder focused on environmental policy, for example)","Boulder Rotary Club; American Red Cross (Boulder-Broomfield Chapter, Disaster Action Team); Institute for Environmental Solutions (steering committee for CO community projects, 2014-present); Global Greengrants (pro bono researcher, 2017-2019); Eco-Cycle (pro bono research associate, 2016-2017); Wild Foundation (pro bono project coordinator, 2015); Colorado Alliance for Environmental Educators; North American Association for Environmental Educators; Community Food Share (weekly volunteer in food distribution, 2015-2018)","I am well-steeped in a variety of analytical methods, from quantitative to qualitative analysis, and seek the best available data to build understanding.  Not all social phenomena are measurable or accepted as valid, and thus I am also very much attuned to how ideas are communicated, sometimes very intentionally designed to divide.  I have also paid attention to the details of redistricting (legal rules, political manuevering, technology aids in achieving politically-favored results, etc.).  While I cannot claim expertise in mapping, I am an analytical thinker and balanced thinker who can spot bias.","Being even-handed and building consensus are critical practices in my teaching and community service.  I seek to identify needs and shared interests in building towards agreement -- moving away from hard positions to language that fosters a commitment to supporting our common ground.  I have long used the negotiation principles and practices developed in the book ""Getting to Yes.""  
In terms of my ability to be fair or impartial, these are practices critical in any effective community activity or in the teaching environment, and most particularly in the contemporary political science class. I communicate to students at the outset that we should expect disagreement and this is partly due to our different sets of life experiences.  Furthermore, none of us has a lock on ""the truth,"" and instead it is the collective set of perspectives that will help us to identify our common reality and get us closer to ""the truth.""  This is akin to the traditional Indian parable, ""the blind men and the elephant.""  With this at the foundation, I am committed to not only giving fair and equal voice to competing perspectives, but also asking individuals to ""step into the shoes of the other"" as we consider why we might disagree.  I favor coming to the middle rather than than win-lose outcomes.","As an academic focused on American politics, I am an avid observer of politics, including of redistricting politics.  I regularly teach undergraduates on issues of American politics, including on the US Congress, and oversee students engaged in political and campaign-related internships (for all political parties and a wide range of candidates at local, state and national levels). I am a regular voter, participated in some nonpartisan get-out-the-vote efforts in 2016, and have been a nominal financial contributor (a small donation to Joe Neguse's District 2 campaign (2019); small donations to state Senate candidate Sally Boccella (2020).",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/37

(see attached resume for previous careers),"Masters in Computer Information Systems, Masters in Landscape Architecture and Urban Design, BA in Geology, Health Coach Certification",I believe that Coloradans should be represented fairly as possible and I will be a strong advocate for that as demonstrated by my volunteer effort with the Tablerock HOA. An independent team to perform redistricting is a great step in the right direction for true representation of the people of Colorado. I would be honored to work with a team of people to achieve that goal in a bipartisan manner!,"Our HOA covenants was set up unfairly such that more than 1/2 of the community was paying more for HOA fees than others and the disparity was growing every time HOA fees were raised because of a covenant rule that stated a portion of the neighborhood was required to pay 1.5 times more than the other portion. The fees are used for maintenance of amenities in the community to which all households have equal access.  I lead the committee to research (with the help of a couple of board members) how we could change the covenants and educate the community on how the fees were used for amenities shared across the community. We learned that we would have to have an election to add an amendment to remove the 1.5 times rule. 

I sent out polls for the community to vote on preferred methods of equalizing the fees. Although this seemed like an insurmountable task, the poll indicated that 18 or 19 of the homeowners who were paying less would vote for the change to the covenants and increase their fees.  This was an indication that the task was not insurmountable and we proceeded with community meetings and presentations which I put together. Two board members and I presented the information.  An election was held and the committee and I canvassed the neighborhood to make sure everyone was aware of the amendment and voted.  All of the 153 households that were currently paying more needed to vote to pass the amendment since the margin was going to be so slim. This was a harder task than it would seem, since some of these homes were rented and/or the owners were hard to reach, or they were in the process of moving.  In addition, 20 households that were paying less were needed to vote for the amendment and increase their fees. 22 (2 more than the 20 needed) neighbors voted for the amendment and raising their fees, while 100% of the homes who had been paying more voted in approval of equalizing fees.  We are now in the 3rd year of our HOA fees being equalized across the entire Tablerock neighborhood and the contentious issue has been solved.",Volunteered for Tablerock HOA as a committee member and Lead to equalize HOA fees in our neighborhood. Poll watcher in primary 2020.  Participated in RLA for Jeffco elections after the primary 2020. I have volunteered to be an Election Judge in the general election.,"My original and main career was in Computer Science as a software developer in Java and C/C++.  I worked as a team lead and applications architect for developing banking, financial, reporting, and project management software.  (see attached resume for details). Software teams are often comprised of intelligent, strong-willed individuals.  I ran design and code reviews and was able to facilitate buy-in to best approaches based on requirements and goals. 

I have an MS in Landscape Architecture and Urban design which required a great deal of analytical work in mapping and design where I used Adobe software such as Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, and CAD to represent design proposals to a jury of faculty. 

With my HOA committee team and a couple of board members were were able to resolve a contentious issue that had existed since our community's inception (around 12 years).  Nobody thought we’d be successful but we were! This involved some neighbors voting to pay more in fees until theirs were equal to what other neighbors had been paying (as detailed above in the volunteer experience section above).","It comes down to keeping the goals and requirements impartially in mind, communicating them, listening, and compromising where possible.

As a poll watcher, I impartially looked for inconsistencies and areas of weakness in the election system.  I worked well in a bipartisan team during the Risk Limiting Audit (RLA) of the primary election.  I was a team lead and applications architect for developing software.  In my software career, I worked successfully with intelligent co-workers to resolve and compromise on design issues.  
I and the rest of the HOA team was able to convince people that were paying less in HOA fees to see that it wasn't right that some people were paying more for the same amenities. I was also able to communicate effectively with people that were upset over changing HOA fee covenant rules by listening, discussion, and outreach via presenting researched information, and holding Q&A sessions.  One of the more valuable skills of being a health coach is listening and supporting a client in their goals.  It often comes back to establishing clear goals and providing support to reach them.","I was a poll watcher for the 2020 Jeffco primary elections and donated to Dan Rosier, Joni for Jeffco, Trump, Cory Gardner and other conservative candidates.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/616

Without it, the will of the people becomes distorted and subject to manipulation by a few.  While I don’t always agree with election results, I can accept them if I believe that they reflect the will of the people.  However, if I believe the elections were unfairly manipulated, the legitimacy of the results comes into question.  I believe that this commission is charged with creating electoral boundaries that will permit elections that reflect the will of the people.","In Colorado, I have been on several boards of directors, and planning committees where I have developed a reputation for asking insightful questions, and challenging untested assumptions.  After the Stem High School shooting, our church decided we should investigate how to reduce isolation and help build a more resilient society beyond the church.  A “Wellness Committee” was formed and the focus was narrowed the to young adults between ages 14 and18.  I was elected to chair the subgroup focusing on developing resilience in the 16-18 year olds.  To determine what mental health issues our target population were facing, I suggested that we add members to our advisory group who were in the 16-18 year old target age range.  We then consulted with private therapists, community mental health programs, Arapahoe/Douglas County Mental health consortium, researched the literature, and searched to find what services were already being offered to address those issues.  The Wellness Committee then made recommendations to the church.  While the Corona Virus has delayed an implementation of these recommendations, preliminary efforts are being made to establish an independent nonprofit organization to implement these suggestions to provide preventive services so that the mental health issues do not develop in the first place.

The most relevant example however, was when I was on the Interim Planning Group for the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services and I chaired a potentially contentious public hearing.  I was told that a group that was upset with HRS might attempt to disrupt the meeting.  I began the meeting by explaining the purpose of the meeting, and laying the ground rules that we would only be discussing issues related to the stated purpose of the meeting.  If people had other issues they would like to discuss, HRS staff would be available at the back of the room to discuss their issues in private.  When the first member of their group began to speak about their grievances, I politely asked if their comments were related to the topic of the meeting.  They agreed that they were not, and I suggested that they discuss their concerns with the HRS staff member at the back of the room.  This process continued through a third person from their group, after which their group no longer attempted to disrupt the meeting.  As I was leaving the meeting, by chance, I met the leader of the group in the elevator, and he apologized for his group’s behavior.  I was able to develop a solution where his group felt heard, but which did not disrupt the intended purpose of the meeting.  So often people who disrupt public meetings are doing so because they do not feel heard, and know of no other way to express their grievances.","•	St Andrew United Methodist Church,

We represented a wide variety of mental health professionals in private practice, including psychologists, mental health counselors, social workers, and marriage and family therapists, each with competing interests.  I called a board retreat to discuss what interests we had in common, and what services we could offer our members that they did not get from other organizations.  The previous President thought this would be a waste of time, but I convinced her to attend.  We looked at what we were currently offering, what other organizations were offering, and what needs weren’t being met, and decided to focus on private practice needs.  As a result, our membership rapidly increased.

As an individual investor, I have been highly successful in applying logic and reason to find promising stocks, analyzing their prospects for long term growth, and assessing obstacles and trends to obtain success.  While I pay attention to several newsletters to narrow the field of stocks to investigate, those newsletters may have biases or may discount important information which I find from other sources.  That is not to say that the stock market is always logical in the short run, or that my analysis is always correct.  But my performance beats the forecasts of many professional financial analyst’s.","In my book, Don’t Carve the Turkey with a Chainsaw: Resolving Family Conflict, I discuss how “conflict is not based on reality, but on people’s interpretations of that reality.”  To understand the other person’s interpretation of reality you must listen.  However, most people only listen to the other person’s reality 1% of the time, and when they do listen, it is to attend to information that confirms their own position and discounts contrasting information.  When you are more concerned with what YOU are saying than hearing what the other person has to say, you listen only long enough to defend your own position, or find flaws in your partner’s logic.  They do likewise, and the more they defend their position, the more they believe their own propaganda.

So, what is the best way to promote consensus?
1. First present our facts and our interpretation of the facts, giving reasons. 
2. Understand the other person’s thinking using sincere questioning and listening. Good listening involves detective work that helps uncover not only the content being expressed, but also the feelings, values, motivation, and interpretations behind the content. 
3. Focus on interests, not positions. Positions are the solutions you generate to solve a problem.  Interests are the underlying reasons influencing the decision.  It is frequently much easier to develop consensus about interests than positions. Frequently, a solution can be developed that addresses common interests, and develops a position neither party had previously considered. 
4. Brainstorm win/win solutions that focus on the future, then select the best options.  When we focus on what we want to happen in the future, rather than focusing on past misdeeds, we can avoid blaming, and the defensiveness that comes with it. 
5. Implement the solution.  
6. Evaluate the outcome using independent measures.

All this requires that the people we are dealing with feel safe, knowing that they will not be attacked, or humiliated.  Judgmental comments, insults, blaming, interrupting, interrogating questioning, all-or-nothing statements, and dishonesty all annihilate safety. “Respect is like air.  If you take it away, it’s all people can think about.  The instant people perceive disrespect in a conversation, the interaction is no longer about the original purpose—it is now about defending dignity.”

We two were responsible for (1) communicating with the employees–especially about the department head’s policy decisions and changes [A series of really sore points, at that time.] (2) communicating information about personnel policies (3) and reporting back to the chief of DCI. 

b. Currently I belong to a variety of organizations, including: Holy Cross Lutheran Church/Wheat Ridge, CO--Holy Cross-St Andrews church/La Junta, CO–Colorado Master Gardeners–Colorado State Parks Raptor Monitors–Colorado Mtn. Club/Pueblo, CO–the Danish-America museum & Genealogy Center/Elk Horn, IA–History Colorado (a.k.a. Colorado Historic Society)–& National Active and Retired Federal Employees (NARFE). 
I’m more active in some of these organizations than others–especially during this viral pandemic. I joined these organizations based on personal interest.  I try to use my interests & talents to benefit the organizations. 
For one example: I identify, & count the raptors at John Martin Reservoir State Park--every 1-2 weeks. (Raptor data–from the state parks--helps the Colorado Parks & Wildlife agency to track the overall wildlife health and food chain--in each state park.)
For another example: I have a genealogy hobby. This hobby leads me into a lot of information--about Danish & Slesvig/Schleswig immigrants, to the United States.  I’ve been able to give the Danish Genealogy Center a good amount of information–about my numerous ancestors--who immigrated from the 1870s to the 1920s.

c. On a personal level--when the COVID-19 pandemic hit Colorado–& my area (SE Colorado): After checking my own situation–I realized I was doing better than most.  But, I knew--that too many others, in Rocky Ford & Otero county--were out-of-work, out of paychecks, scared, and confused.  (There aren’t many economic opportunities or much wealth in this area.)  
I considered what I could do to help.  My “helps” so far: (1) pick up extra canned food–and deliver them, weekly-- to the local food bank in La Junta (2) pickup groceries, for my neighbor  who can’t drive, and (3) make phone calls and send cards--to friends & neighbors–who were also locked in--especially those in the senior living places.","1.

7. Colorado State Parks Raptor Monitors","a. From 1985 to 1987 and from 1988 to 1997–I worked as a personal computer troubleshooter.  I  resolved a constant stream of software, hardware and network problems–for a good number of computer users.  
With each trouble call–I had to start by finding out what was really needed or what was really going wrong.  Then, I had to apply a good deal of reasoning/logic and computer knowledge–to find a solution. And last, I needed to explain the problem (as well as possible) to the user and tell them “what to do next time”.      

b. I’ve been a volunteer Colorado Master Gardener in Otero county–from 2007 to the present.  Most of my gardening trouble calls need my on-site investigation–gardening knowledge--research–and then reasoning--to determine (1) what the gardener’s/plant’s problem is and (2) how to resolve or deal with the problem.  

c. I am a volunteer raptor monitor at John Martin Reservoir State Park (2006 to the present). (Raptors are predator birds–such as hawks, eagles, harriers, etc.).  At the state park, I first locate  raptors. Then I use my observation skills--knowledge about raptor plumage, behaviors, and migration habits–and my logic/reasoning--to determine the actual species, I’ve found.  (I report the numbers & species to Colorado Parks & Wildlife.  They use this data to keep track of the welfare--of the state park’s wildlife.) 
						
d. One of my hobbies is genealogy: Genealogy takes a surprising amount of logic/reasoning. For example, how do I tell, if I’ve found the same ancestor--in two (or more) different records?  I need to judge dates–locations–the spelling of names & places–handwriting–handwriting, in a non-English language--other records, in a document–family stories, etc. Sometimes the records do not match up. Then I must use my reasoning–knowledge of history–and knowledge of genealogy–to make a best guess.","a. As to promoting consensus: When faced with disagreeing persons–I try to find & propose different points of view–or present other possible solutions.  
For example, I was placed on a Jefferson county jury in July 1998 (a child neglect case)–and somehow elected chairman of the jury.  At first, two or three, of the jurors--went on and on–“psychoanalyzing” and blaming the mother, for everything.  I realized--that line of debate would get us nowhere–because, you can’t get inside anybody else’s head.  So I suggested that we concentrate only on the actual physical evidence–i.e. what had been presented in court, and what had happened to the children.  That seemed to concentrate everyone’s thinking.  The jury was able to reached an agreement--and return to court--in a surprising amount of time. 

b. As to being fair or impartial: As an employee, I was recruited (occasionally), to go thru job applications or to join applicant interviews.  The applications & interviews contained all sorts of inputs–a variety negative remarks--bad grammar & spelling–”don’t care” attitudes–and political statements.  I found that I needed to “wall off” the negative & extraneous inputs. Responsibilities, experience, genuine qualifications, & awards are (hopefully) left. Then, I could make reasonable choices.","1.

Canyon Reserve Townhome Owners Association (board member 2018-present)",Please see my 52 years of professional and academic experience.,"The most important job of public universities is to serve as an arena for civic engagement. For 46 years, my introductory graduate course in public service and public affairs began by teaching and modeling the “rules of civic engagement.” In a culture heavily influenced by rant-radio talk show hosts and ideologically charged political sound bites, people typically get little training on how to discuss policy issues on which they disagree deeply. This makes democracy less functional.

Groups are more effective when they follow the rules of civic engagement, which are:
•	No matter how much you disagree with someone, be more concerned with learning what they believe and why than with explaining or defending your own viewpoint.
•	No matter how illogical or uninformed they seem to be, do not shout them down, call them names, or tune them out by stereotyping them in your own mind.
•	If you have trouble with these two rules, repeat this mantra silently as you listen: “Is it possible that under any circumstances, some part of what they say might conceivably be true?” Repeat until they finish and ask you what you think.
•	If this mantra gives you trouble, do it while breathing through your nose, not your mouth.

After a few weeks of modeling, students unconsciously begin to use these rules themselves. The class transforms itself from a theater for eloquent bullies into an arena for civic engagement by a group of reflective, intelligent adults. Shouting, name-calling, and derogatory asides die out. Speakers get better at stating their views succinctly and supporting them effectively with expert opinions, personal experiences, data, and logic. Classmates turn toward the speaker, listen more closely, and interrupt less. They address questions and comments to each other by name. Little by little, as the dominant ones listen more and talk less, the quieter ones creep into the newly cleared conversational space. Soon, no one misses class except for work or family emergencies. This is how we learn together.

Board of Industry Advisors, Warren Tech High School, Outdoor Leadership Program, 2017-present
Climbing Wall Association, 2016-present","Some of my past jobs and training have involved significant data-analysis and program evaluation, but regardless of my role I am a data seeker in my decision making process. And while I try to empathize with an emotional perspective, I do not let emotional arguments determine my decision making. As an example, in the customer service context that I operate in currently, an individual might bring up a complaint or may be vocal about an opinion. As convincing as they may be about their concern or opinion, I will dive much deeper into the root of the issue to determine if their concern is widely held or represents a larger problem, before making a decision based on one or a handful of comments. It can be tempting to make decisions based only on an individual's compelling argument or emotional plea, but I am committed to delving deeper and gathering more information to understand a problem better (and determine if it is in fact a problem) before attempting to solve it. In the real world, great data doesn't always exist, so to avoid analysis paralysis and be in a position to move forward, I supplement data-analysis with experience, seeking input, and discussing options, and considering potential outcomes before making a decision. I also keep in mind the larger goal - solving a problem should be in service of achieving our vision and mission. For example, my company's current vision is to transform the world through the experience of climbing (we run climbing gyms). When I receive input from customers, I will consider the problem of a member feeling excluded from the community much more seriously than the problem of our gym not having a sauna for member use. One problem (inclusion) is directly related to achieving our vision, the other (sauna) simply represents someone's personal preference for their gym experience, but solving that problem will not contribute materially to our overall vision. Part of the reason I would like to be involved in this commission is because I enjoy the process of problem solving and am excited to participate in the challenging process of redistricting for Colorado.","I am a big-picture thinker and in my job am frequently required to move a group toward consensus. Of course I have personal opinions on issues, but I do let let an attachment to a particular position cloud my ability to consider many perspectives and keep the larger objective in mind. I have found that my own opinions often evolve as I engage in discussion or a consensus-building process, so I have learned over the years that my initial position on may not be my final position - all of which is to say I am committed to achieving the larger goal/vision of my work than remaining attached to a particular strategy/tactic or position. I am able to listen actively and engage with people who hold perspectives different from my own to reach conclusions or take action. In a group setting such as this commission, I could play a role of facilitator, active listener, observer, and monitor (in the sense of monitoring if our work is on track or identifying if we are getting away from the bigger goal/objective). A major professional challenge I have moved through recently is a merger of two companies, and my role at a leader in the organization was to repeatedly express the vision of the company, the objectives/goals we are moving toward, gather input from stakeholders, and to have conversations that build buy-in to our new company's direction. In this process, I have been able to support two large teams in moving in a new direction, finding common ground with this direction, and generally feeling bought-in to our collective work and the outcomes. I like to approach problem solving as a collaborative learning process, where through the process we elevate the group's collective knowledge and wisdom to come up with solutions and make decisions that best serve our common goal. In this process, I may not always get ""my way,"" but I also know that a group can come up with more brilliant, practical, or elegant solutions that I could on my own, so I promote collaboration, learning, and always refocusing on our common goals. 

I believe I also am well equipped to be fair and impartial on this commission.

As an unaffiliated voter, generally displeased with the two party system, I am interested in making sure the Colorado State representatives in congress are elected fairly and competitively. 

Colorado unfortunately has a history of gerrymandering in order to give one political party more power over another. Districting commissions often also re-draw districting lines in order to protect their own seat (or the incumbent member of their party) in office. These tactics need to stop in order for the voice of the people of Colorado to truly be heard. If the districts are organized such that the representative earns the votes of their constituents. This is very important to me as a Colorado voter because not only to I want my voice to be heard and  I want to ensure the same for my fellow Coloradans.

The great President John F. Kennedy said, “Let us not seek the Republican answer of the Democratic answer, but the right answer. Let us not seek to fix the blame for the past. Let us accept our own responsibility for the future.” My primary goal as a member of this commission will be to seek that right answer. I love this state, and I believe that the governmental tactics and changes taking place here in Colorado have been and continue to be a model for the nation. That is why I am interested in serving on the commission, not only to serve my state but to serve my country.","As a general contractor, it was important to maintain a positive relationship with all of the trade partners working on site to keep them coordinated and functional. As a project engineer with Martines Palmeiro Construction (MPC) I had to advocate for both the organizations who worked under mine and our clients in the day-to-day tasks in the field. Often times a trade partner would interfere with another trade partner’s work for their own convenience. I had to ensure that the best interests of all the trades were executed in order maintain a functional site. Furthermore, it was also my responsibility to ensure that the best interests of the owner were being executed despite the fact that the owner was not present on site. Nearly all of the trade partners I worked with are based in Colorado, as many of them are small businesses in the Denver area.","I spent the majority of the past five years since November 10, 2015 as a student at both Colorado State University (CSU) in Fort Collins and University of Colorado (CU) in Boulder. Because of this most of my public involvement was within my university community. At CSU I served as student ambassador for the College of Engineering, which I belonged to. As an ambassador I worked primarily with high school students considering majoring in engineering, at CSU or otherwise. I gave advice to these students as they made their college decisions and offered my perspective to them as both an engineering student and as a CSU Ram. 

At the end of my undergraduate education at CSU, I joined a professional origination known as the Order of the Engineer. This is an organization that upholds the ethical standards of engineers in our society. As many people entrust their lives with the structures and technology designed by engineers, this organization continuously reminds them of the responsibly they hold.

In graduate school at CU, I earned a scholarship from the Structural Engineers Association of Colorado (SEAC) and have attended a number of meetings and site visits with the organization since. Although I am not an official SEAC member, I am currently considering joining this organization as well.","Being a structural engineer, logic and reason come very naturally to me. I am a fast learner and an analytical thinker. I am exceptionally good at Excel and I enjoy solving mathematically interesting problems. I am also a young and enthusiastic individual who likes a good challenge. 

When I was a graduate student at CU, I had to apply these skills to my research project in order to report accurate and unbiased results. For this project, I was tasked investigating the effects of a polymer additive on the freeze-thaw properties of concrete. To do this, I had to college and analyze a significant amount of data over the course of several months. I also had to write and defend my thesis in front of several faculty members and concrete experts to prove my results were valid. I would take a similar approach to the task of re-districting Colorado. My “data collection” phase would involve hearing the voices of my fellow Coloradans scattered throughout the state. My “analysis” phase would be the actual re-drawing of the district lines with the assistance of the other commissioners. And finally my “defense” phase would be to convince and mediate among the other members of the committee.","As a member of the commission, I will advocate for the use of the shortest-split line method to divide the voters throughout the state into fairly divided, equally populated areas. The use of this algorithm is at least a good place to start, because it uses a mathematical method that is free of bias. I would also use that as an argument among the other commissioners, because you can’t argue with math. As an engineer, I am good at both being analytical and convincing of an impartial answer.

Next, I think it’s worth considering the cultural density of the various areas of the state. For example, because Baca County and Prowers County are culturally similar to each other, it may make sense to group them together in the same district. However, it is important to make sure there is a healthy amount of competition for the candidates running to represent these districts. For example if it is known that the majority of voters in Weld County are Republicans and the majority of voters in Larimer County are Democrats, it may make sense to group Weld and Larimer County together in the same district to encourage both the Republican and Democratic candidates for that district to campaign harder to earn their votes","In the past five years, I have been interested but not heavily involved in political activities outside of voting. I have not given money to any organizations other than the perchance a Marco Rubio bumper sticker in 2016. At the end of 2019 I also signed a petition in Colorado that put Proposition 115 on the 2020 ballot and made a $5 donation supporting the initiative.

Although I grew up in a mostly conservative household, I am an independent thinker who may align with the Libertarian party rather than the Democratic or Republican party. I even voted Libertarian in 2016 because I felt that both of the two major candidates were not representative of how most people in America think. But because I do not want to subject myself a political party, I am an unaffiliated citizen and have chosen to apply for this commission as such.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/1157

I recognize that it is important to hear and address all voices that have an interest in the outcome, but that you cannot let the perfect become the enemy of the good. Sooner or later you have to make decisions and an imperfect decision made timely is better than a perfect decision made too late. You will never fix all bugs in a piece of software, or in a redistricting map, but that doesn't mean you can't release a good or even great piece of work. I believe that the key to being a functional team is to have a strong set of core values and working towards those. As long as you have strategic alignment, individual issues become a series of small tactical compromises that allow each group to feel their voice is being heard. I would work to identify the strategic goals of the commission and apply software engineering methodology, where appropriate, to resolve the disagreements. Software development is a lot like politics, as it should be a meritocracy but in reality tends to be dominated by individuals with strong personalities. I believe the techniques I have used to achieve success dealing with programmers would translate well to building strong working relationships with other members of the commission. I am not swayed by bullying or persuasion, but focus on facts and figures.

I attended the Colorado College's 'Best Practices in Redistricting' workshop in September, 2020 to learn more about the legal requirements and background, and have been studying how other states established their districting rules and prioritized different criteria.  My aim in doing so is to become a fully-qualified commissioner on day one.","My overall approach is to recommend what is best for Colorado as a whole.  We have a strong state with many positive aspects, none of which I want to see diminished or endangered.  I want to listen carefully to what everyone has to say.  Ultimately, this commission will be considering tradeoffs between different criteria. Since there will be no straightforward, universal consensus on what is ""fair"", I believe we should first establish ground rules on what we will prioritize based on legal requirements, community input, staff guidance, and the unique attributes that make Colorado great.  As we move into looking at partitioning plans, I would respectfully guide the commission to play by those ground rules.  We do, however, have guidance on what is not fair: gerrymandered district partitions.

My academic training was mostly in philosophy (with a smattering of political science), and one of my main interests was in ethics.  The intersection of democracy and ethics is the notion of equity for all citizens; viz. that every person has equal say and power to shape the nature of the political bodies which affect his/her live.

The way that voting districts are set up is, obviously, the foundation of whether any particular system is equitable or not.  Redistricting has been used for partisan purposes—by all political parties—from well before Governor Gerry ‘gerrymandered’ the Massachusetts districts in 1812 up to today.  This has been the source of a considerable lack of fairness in our political system.

I am proud of Colorado for being a leader in the movement to take the redistricting function away from legislatures in order to try to come up with a fair and rational process which will benefit all citizens in a equitable fashion.  This is an important step forward both for Colorado, and through our example, for the rest of the country.  I would be honored and excited to be able to participate in this important work.","As a dealer in antiquarian maps and prints, I joined the board of the Denver Public Library Friends Foundation almost as soon as I moved to Colorado, from Philadelphia, in 2010.  The library holds an important collection of western material, and both my wife and I are long term supporters of reading as a means for children and adults to improve their lives.  Even once I left the board, I have continued to work with the Friends, running a number of programs for them to help raise awareness and money, including some ""Antiques Roadshow"" type events (I have been a regular appraiser on that TV program) and giving regular, free lectures on maps and prints.  

I have also been a board member of the Rocky Mountain Map Society, running both their regular lecture programs and their annual Map Month every May (except this one).  These are all free programs open to the public.

My wife and I have been regular supporters of a number of local arts groups, including Wonderbound and the Baroque Chamber Orchestra of Colorado, as well as local history related groups such as Historic Denver, History Colorado, Colorado Preservation, and Four Mile Historic Park.  I worked as a board member of the BCOC for three years.","Board member, Denver Public Library Friends Foundation, 2010-2014; Board member, Baroque Chamber Orchestra of Colorado, 2015-2018; Board member, Rocky Mountain Map Society, 2005-current; Board member, American Historical Print Collectors Society, 2010-2015, 2019-current","I studied philosophy in higher education institutions for almost a decade, and indeed originally planned to teach philosophy as a profession.  Two of my main areas of study were ethics and logic.  The latter is something which I feel is a sine non qua for any rational argument, and indeed I have taught a class in informal logic to high school students as I think it is a skill necessary for any “reasoned life.”  I believe one of my most important and strong skills is the ability to reason in a logical manner.","I believe that I am intellectually suited and trained to be able to wrestle with the issues that a redistricting committee will face, I have a very strong sense of the importance of fairness, I have strong organizational skills, and, of course, I also am very well versed in map related subjects.

My academic training was much focused on philosophical argument, in the sense of being able to take an open-minded and clear-eyed look at the issues involved in any particular question to be decided.  I have the ability to identify the core issues of various questions and to present them in a clear and unbiased manner.  Even if I disagree with another person in an argument, I am adept at understanding his/her viewpoint and am able to lay out exactly where and why we disagree.  This does not always solve the argument, but it at least lets the parties understand the real issues involved.

In terms of fairness, my belief in the fundamental importance of fairness is rooted in the moral belief which I hold to be the most important to live by, viz. that everyone should treat others as they wish to be treated.  If one follows this Golden Rule, then fairness necessarily follows, as no one would want to be treated unfairly by another.  I have mostly supported the Democratic Party in the last decade or so, but that support is circumstantial; my support for a fair, equitable political system is far more foundational to my beliefs.","I was a Precinct Committee Person for the Democratic Party, Precinct 623, House District 6, from 2015 to 2016.

I’ve experienced several during my previous committee work and enjoy participating in different models.  Brain storming strategies allow getting all ideas identified, and participants feel heard.  Using the brain storming ideas can be used to find commonalities, potential roadblocks, and priorities.   People who work with me know I will call on the members who have been quiet or not offering any input.  Some issues and conflicts can carry emotional reactions.  Best hopes/worst fears can move the group to look at the emotions in a rational way.  Understanding each other’s background and experiences gives insight into interpretations.  
I also believe summarizing all points brought up lets all see that the solution must cover multiple areas.  Setting priorities allows for a potential ranking to see what the solution must cover.  Reminding participants that no one group may get everything they want, and that the compromises must look equitable from a 360-degree perspective.

In addition to facilitating and building consensus among our governing board, I have also worked diligently to build bi-partisan consensus around major policy initiatives at the Colorado General Assembly.  I’m fond of saying that higher education is not a partisan issue and I believe my reputation among elected Republicans and Democrats across Colorado backs this up.  On point is the reality that at the end of my legislative career the good friends I made were spread across both caucuses. This work is best done utilizing active listening techniques and identifying areas of agreement among parties.  During my tenure at CMU, we have tripled the size of campus, doubled student enrollment and dramatically turned around the financial health of the organization.  This work would not have been possible without building consensus, elevating compromise and keeping a laser-like focus on what’s best for students.

For the 10 years before then, I was a Social Studies teacher at Grandview High School in the Cherry Creek School District in Aurora, CO.  During that time I also occasionally worked on a contract basis for Educational Testing Service to write AP exam questions in AP U.S. Government & Politics and AP Comparative Government & Politics, and also worked on a contract basis with the publishing firm Bedford, Freeman & Worth to help edit a textbook now widely used in teaching AP U.S. Government & Politics.","B.A. in Political Science from the State University of New York at Buffalo (1973)
J.D. from Harvard Law School (1976)
Teacher Education Program from the University of Denver resulting in a teaching certificate (2001)","First, because doing so reflects who I am.  It sounds like serving on the commission will involve hard work for the public's benefit in exchange for little pay.  That's exactly what I did as a teacher for the past 19 years.  

Second, because I have a particular interest in the commission's goals.  I studied Political Science in school, and have had a lifelong fascination with that topic.  Two of the courses I taught for many years, AP U.S. Government & Politics and AP Human Geography, address the issue of gerrymandering.  And my teaching of We the People required that I become familiar with the constitutional, legal, and political issues involved in drawing political boundaries, including one-person-one-vote, the need for contiguity, a preference for compactness and communities of interest, and the Supreme Court's creative distinction between racial gerrymandering (prohibited in Shaw v. Reno (1993)) and political gerrymandering (allowed in Rucho v. Common Cause (2019)) even though there's a clear correlation between race and political leanings.  I want to do my part to enhance democratic principles in Colorado, so it can serve as a model for the country.

Third, because I have ample time to devote to the commission's work now that I'm retired.  And I have the good fortune to be healthy and energetic enough to handle the workload.

And fourth, because I'm confident I can serve faithfully and honorably, helping to produce a map that the people of Colorado can take pride in.","As a first year attorney, I participated in my own small way in assisting others who were then luminaries in the Colorado legal community to create the Colorado Lawyers Committee.  Later in my law practice, I joined the Board of Directors of the Lawyers Committee.  I've contributed to that organization for decades, continuing to do so throughout my teaching career and even in retirement.  And in coordination with the Lawyers Committee, I served as one of three lead counsel in Hafer v. Romer (1990), in which I represented a group of school districts, school administrators, parents of school-age children, and taxpayers who collectively challenged the constitutionality of the then-existing system of funding public schools in Colorado.  My colleagues and I pursued that lawsuit for many months, and achieved our clients' main goals when the Colorado General Assembly enacted a far more equitable formula for financing public education throughout the state that -- while not perfect by any means -- nevertheless dramatically reduced the funding disparity between property-rich and property-poor school districts.     

Also, while I was actively practicing law, I volunteered extensively for the Colorado Bar Association, serving on its Ethics Committee for 15 years and its Grievance Policy Committee for 5 years, and serving as Chair of the latter. 

Finally, since retiring from teaching, I've reactivated my law license for the sole purpose of performing pro bono work through Colorado Legal Services.","(1) Since November 10, 2015 I've been a member of the National Council for the Social Studies, an organization promoting the teaching of civic education.  (2) During that same time, in the course of teaching AP U.S. Government & Politics, I worked closely with (and contributed to) the Colorado Center for Civic Learning and Engagement which sponsors the We the People program in Colorado.  We the People is a nationwide competition of constitutional analysis, and is the single best educational program I've encountered.  I'll briefly describe this program elsewhere in this application, though Judge Daniel Taubman and Andrea Shpall, in their letters of recommendation accompanying my application, shed further light on what it encompasses.  (3) My community includes my synagogue, where for many years I've regularly served as a Gabbai responsible for ensuring the Torah is read correctly, and I also serve as an occasional Torah reader.","I had the good fortune to receive the best legal training imaginable, not merely from a fine law school but also from two of the most insightful and analytical attorneys I've ever known: Hardin Holmes and Ken Starr (the lawyer, not the judge, though I appeared before the judge when he sat on the D.C. Circuit).  In the course of a 25-year law career, my analytical horizons were broadened by the opportunity to work with law colleagues of differing races, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations, as well as by a diverse clientele encompassing billionaires and welfare recipients, Fortune 500 companies and mom-and-pop businesses.  I represented those clients, applying logic and reason in the process, in a wide variety of civil, criminal, domestic, juvenile, probate, administrative, tax, and bankruptcy matters on both a fee-generating and pro bono basis.  While my law practice was varied, I focused on complex commercial litigation, requiring me in jury trials -- some lasting many weeks -- to convey detailed concepts in straightforward ways while still respecting the jurors' intelligence.  (As matters ended up, I used similar skills in my classroom teaching difficult concepts to my students.)  And when I practiced law, Martindale-Hubbell compiled my fellow lawyers' views of my analytical skills by awarding me a rating of ""av,"" the highest rating given.    

You have better things to do than read some of my trial and appellate filings, though they would serve as ample evidence of my analytical skills.  But at least one piece of my writing is still publicly available (I think), namely the chapter on Colorado Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1 (involving derivative actions, a fairly sophisticated topic) in Colorado Civil Procedure Forms and Commentary (D. Knapp, ed.).  

Some might think that my need to apply logic and reason to a problem would lessen as I transitioned to teaching, a key period in my life described in my personal statement accompanying this application, but that wasn't so.  I created a large number of lesson plans that sought to reach students on many levels, visual as well as auditory, kinetic as well as contemplative.  And I created course binders for my students ranging in length from 600 to 800 pages in three of the subjects I taught (AP U.S. Government & Politics, AP Comparative Government & Politics, and AP Human Geography) that contained all of the notes, articles, activities, organizers, vocabulary, and review materials used over the course of a year of teaching, and then -- after updating those materials yearly -- freely shared them with my teaching colleagues, as my former teaching colleague Terri Bramhall notes in her accompanying letter of recommendation.

In fact, I would make the case that interacting with teenagers on a sustained basis -- trying to motivate them while they struggle with their emotions, their intellect, their friends, their family lives, their self-image, their emerging sexuality, their hormones -- demanded a greater number of analytical skills, more logic and reason, than I ever needed as an attorney.","A former student gave me a T-shirt that reads, ""Teachers do what lawyers do, only with less pay, more judges, and a tougher jury.""  I wear that shirt with pride.  Teenagers are the hardest audience imaginable.  They're going through profound physical and psychological changes, while also struggling to find their own identity and their place in the world.  And to compound matters, my students came from highly diverse households, racially, ethnically, linguistically, religiously, economically, and politically.  

Promoting consensus is necessary to succeed as a high school teacher.  So is the need to make each student feel as though they're being treated fairly and impartially.  The first step in reaching any student is to make her/him feel welcome, part of a supportive learning environment.  I learned early in my teaching career that if I treat my students with honesty, honor, and respect -- if I love them for who they are, see what they're capable of becoming, and model how they can get there -- they'd walk through fire to achieve their goals.  And my approach to teaching worked.  My students enjoyed overwhelming success over the course of my 19-year teaching career, with 97% of them passing their AP exams despite a nationwide pass rate of (depending on the exam and year) roughly between 50 and 60%.  I took particular pride in the success enjoyed by my students of color, many of whom had been underserved in their earlier schooling.  (Grandview has never imposed any prerequisites or academic requirements for any student to enroll in its AP courses, and has actively encouraged all students, no matter their background, to sign up for them.)  And along the way, I received many teaching awards, among them Teacher of the Year at Grandview High School, Teacher of the Year for the Cherry Creek School District, Social Studies Teacher of the Year for the State of Colorado, and even Social Studies Teacher of the Year for the United States.  

I'm applying here for a spot on a redistricting commission, not another teaching award.  But to appreciate how I can build consensus, create agreement within a diverse group, and interact with others fairly and impartially, it will help you to understand how I succeeded in doing these precise things with the toughest audience I've ever encountered.  

Teaching the subject of government requires a particular focus on fairness and impartiality.  I taught in a community whose political views spanned the political spectrum.  In his accompanying letter of recommendation, my former principal and district superintendent Harry Bull writes about my desire to give credence to right-of-center as well as left-of-center political loyalties.  Though I openly rejected fringe viewpoints from both ends of the spectrum, I never considered my classroom to be a political platform.  To the contrary, I always believed that my role as a teacher was to prod the students to learn how to think, not what to think.  That was best exemplified by the large sign in my classroom on the wall that faced my door and greeted every student each day upon entering my room, containing one word: ""Think . . . . .""   This should give you a sense of my willingness to respect the logic of a political position I happen not to share.  Doing so will be crucial to working with Republicans and Independents on the commission.  

Moreover, I watched the results of consensus-building -- and honed my own talents at achieving it -- in the course of guiding my students for over 10 years through the We the People program.  Participation in that program was a required component of my year-long course in AP U.S. Government & Politics.  It will help you, in assessing my application, to understand what that remarkable program encompasses.  You can learn about it by accessing https://www.civiced.org/we-the-people, though Judge Taubman and Ms. Shpall add insight about it in their letters of recommendation.  

Students enrolled in We the People are assigned to six small groups that analyze the Constitution from different perspectives, including its historic and philosophical underpinnings, how it operates in theory and in practice, and what constitutional issues are particularly relevant in the 21st Century.  Because the program's organizers address different constitutional issues each year, I immersed myself in widespread constitutional analysis to a far greater extent than I had ever done in my law practice or even in my Constitutional Law course taken in 1974.  But by far, the greatest challenge I encountered in that program was teaching my students the art of consensus building.  Each grouping of students was called upon to make a coherent, cooperative presentation to a panel of judges; and in fact, per the WTP scoring formula, the judges would deduct points if any individual student tried to hoard the spotlight at the expense of his or her group mates.  

And so, in the course of over 10 years, working with six WTP groups each year, I helped over 60 groupings of students reach consensus on a wide variety of complex issues.  That required a great deal of time and effort, as Judge Taubman and Ms. Shpall detail in their letters, calling upon me to contribute emotional support as well as constitutional analysis; but I'm enormously proud of the success my students enjoyed each year, where they placed either first or second in the State of Colorado and participated in two WTP national competitions, each time winning awards for their presentations.  (We were invited to Washington a third time this past spring, yet another event interrupted by COVID.)  

Finally, my ability to interact with others, including -- in the context of this application -- other members of the commission can be seen in one additional way.  I'm proud to say that while I was teaching, many of my former students would go out of their way to stay in touch.  For reasons I could never fully explain, my former students living in the area would frequently return to Grandview, to share with me their college experiences, to ask for my analysis of current events bearing on issues we'd studied in class, and to show off their significant other, their spouse, and occasionally even their kids.  And former students, including those living out of state and abroad, would often communicate as well via email.  Just last week, for instance, a former student who graduated in 2010 emailed me an invitation to his upcoming wedding.  One of my favorite emails was received last year from a former student who had graduated from Grandview in 2007.  That former student, who is now a Social Studies teacher in Utah, wanted to share with me the lessons he'd learned in my classroom about how to teach.  After detailing a number of my teaching methods, recounted with remarkable accuracy twelve years after the fact, this former student concluded with this: ""My students may not know your name, but they know a lot about the kind of teacher you are, because it determines so much about the kind of teacher I try to be.""  This testimonial is gratifying and humbling, but it also speaks volumes about how I treat others.  

I try to respect everyone I encounter.  But respecting others doesn't mean kowtowing to them.  I'll no doubt disagree on occasion with some of my fellow commissioners.  That will require give-and-take, and hopefully an ability to convince the commission as a whole of the strength of my logic.  I promise to hold true to what I believe, but also to listen carefully to opposing viewpoints in order to try to achieve a consensus that will advance the interests of all Coloradans.","Following a brief foray into campus politics, which I mention in my resume, I turned to helping others reach their political goals.  Over the years I've volunteered at a low organizational level on many political campaigns, including Barack Obama's (2008 and 2012), Hillary Clinton's (2016), and Joe Biden's (2020) presidential runs.  Since retiring, I've devoted roughly 200 hours to the Biden campaign focusing on the battleground state of Wisconsin, mostly on a special assignment to increase voter access in Democratic-leaning areas of that state by enlisting 16 and 17-year old high school students to serve as poll workers -- something permitted under Wisconsin law.  To accomplish that, I helped as needed to coordinate the efforts of teachers, principals, school superintendents, and municipal clerks in key regions throughout Wisconsin.  

As for political donations, since November 10, 2015 I've contributed money to the following campaigns: Hillary Clinton for President, Joe Biden for President, Andrew Romanoff for Senate (primary campaign), John Hickenlooper for Senate (general election campaign), Jason Crow for House of Representatives (CO -- 6th CD),  Hillary Scholten for House of Representatives (MI -- 3rd CD), and Christina Finello for House of Representatives (PA -- 1st CD).  As I interpret the term ""political organizations,"" since November 2015 I've contributed to three PACs (the Committee to Protect Medicare PAC, A Woman's Place PAC, and the Lincoln Project) and four other organizations (the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Planned Parenthood, the Sierra Club, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)) that I gladly supported precisely because of their political activities.",https://redistricting.colorado.gov/legislative_applicants/953
