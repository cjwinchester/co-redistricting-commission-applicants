<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My Wife is a High school teacher and I have worked closely with her to organize a capstone project which brings in professionals from many different disciplines to assess and provide feedback for her students&#39; final educational projects. In my current work I organize the needs of active duty military service members and their families and translate those into medical benefits. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
It has become rather disheartening to see both of the major political parties try to wield power in order to capture votes instead of working toward legitimately representing their constituents. The most important thing I can think of is not to make legislation an echo chamber of a narrow thought group but to challenge our political leaders to govern toward the good of the people, all of the people. A leader, is someone that understands that not everyone in the room has one goal or one need. Our political leaders should be persuaded to /truly/ represent people and not just their preferred group. It shouldn&#39;t be the norm to have districts drawn up to include only a certain demographic of constituents friendly only to  a particular political party.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have 2 boys age 10 and 12. That probably says enough. . . There isn&#39;t a day that goes by that I don&#39;t have to find a way to get them to see that they are, neither one 100% in the right or that the other is not 100% in the wrong. At work, I manage a group of employees that provide services to hundreds of different sections with in the Defense Health Agency. They are all competing for assets, time and, resources. In the last 5 years I haven&#39;t had a single complaint about anyone under me or their judgement. This isn&#39;t so much a statements on me as it is the ability to let good people do a good job and to trust them to hear and address the needs of the people they serve. Consensus isn&#39;t about /always/ giving people what they want, it is about understanding and hearing concerns and addressing those concerns, if not entirely meeting them.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I focus on the big picture when I am presented with a problem. It is just as import to understand where you are going as it is to understand the path to get there. When I graduated High School I bought a car that was used and had a lot of issues. I learned early on that the key to keep that car running was to maintain the parts. If I didn&#39;t want the car to overheat and stop running, I had maintain the cooling system. If I didn&#39;t want the engine to get starved for gas and stop running I had to maintain the fuel system. Likewise, a problem is often caused from not looking carefully (or understanding) the things that are going to effect the outcome. If you know where you need to go or what you need to do in order to keep something working efficiently, you can determine ways to prevent a problems.
