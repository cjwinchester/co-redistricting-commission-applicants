<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have been involved in grassroots organizing for more than 30 years. I was raised to be politicized by parents and family who were deeply involved in the Chicano movement of the 70’s. That legacy has and continues to play a significant role in guiding the work I do within community. I do not approach this work from an academic framework but rather through lived experience and through relationship.  I’m committed to support grassroots community to build power, understand oppression in the context of lived experience and to talk about these concepts through lived examples and stories. The most lasting social change occurs from the grassroots.  I have certainly engaged in change work through legislative bodies but find top-down change to be more reactive than proactive and will continue to invest in growing power and amplifying voices from among those most impacted by inequity.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Systemic change is very difficult and folks like me, grassroots folks, aren&#39;t always engaged in understanding the ways political systems and government serve us and can contribute to quality of life. This is a tremendous opportunity to be a part of building a significant piece of our political system, it is the foundation upon which at least 10 years of elections will hinge.  Ensuring equitable representation is paramount and what would guide me in this process but I&#39;m also excited to use this opportunity to share what I learn among grassroots networks because knowledge is power.  I want to help ensure we maintain the high levels of turnout we saw now in 2020 and if I can help do that, sign me up!
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am highly relational and I believe in consensus as a tool to help a group reach the best decision.  I&#39;ve done extensive training in consensus models and I model the practice, where appropriate, in my own work. The process of consensus can certainly support one&#39;s ability to be fair and impartial.  I can be fair and impartial and I think given my own social location and the kind of power I would hold individually on a commission such as this does not lend itself to my having undue influence. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am highly analytical and was raised in a family with broad political beliefs - I was always encouraged to evaluate issues, the simple and the complex. I like analysis - it engages my high attention to detail, critical thinking abilities, decision-making, and my research skills. For example, my own analysis of power comes from careful examination of the ways I do and do not have assigned power.  Those experiences guide my analysis.  I will listen to experts and I easily embrace logic.  I also see the opportunity to temper logic with balancing the needs of a broad constituency.
