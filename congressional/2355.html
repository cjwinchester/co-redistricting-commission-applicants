        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Juliane Gleason</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Juliane Gleason
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Julie</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Information Technology, S&amp;P Global
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I initially attended CU-Boulder as a music major, but I found that entering the workforce was better suited to me, and so I left. While I was working, full time, I would occasionally take weekend or evening classes at Arapahoe Community College (working toward a computer technician certificate) and the Women&#39;s College at the University of Denver. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80007
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have never been involved in political campaigns. I think the first time I donated to a political organization was in 2017, after Trump implemented the travel ban for majority Muslim countries. 

I am extremely disappointed in how the U.S. Senate first blocked Obama&#39;s supreme court nomination and then confirmed a sexual predator, and so I made small donations (between $20 and $50) to various Democratic Senatorial campaigns in the 2020 election. These included Colorado (Hickenlooper), Maine (Gideon), Iowa (Greenfield), Texas (MJ Hegar), Arizona (Kelly), and Michigan (Peters). 

I have been a donor to the ACLU for a few years, as well. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I&#39;ve done some volunteer work for Volunteers for Outdoor Colorado, the Rocky Mountain Food Bank, and the Horse Protection League since 2015.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
One of my first jobs was with the Colorado Restaurant Association, back in the 90s. This introduced me to the nonprofit space and the role that associations play in politics. But, other than that, I haven&#39;t done any specific advocacy or representation of any particular group or organization in Colorado. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Sometimes life grants you an opportunity to make a difference for the greater good. When I saw the call for applicants, due to lack of diversity, I looked at the stats and then attempted to promote this opportunity to other people. Then, a couple weeks later, I saw news reports that the applicant pool still lacked in both diversity and candidates, so I decided to submit my application. Although I am not an ethnic minority, at least I&#39;m not a white man over the age of 60. 

Although serving on a redistricting commission is not my idea of a good time, I do view it as a civic responsibility and an opportunity to impact something of great importance. From the time I understood the impact of gerrymandering, as a young woman, I have been horrified on how it has been used to disenfranchise and disadvantage people in order to secure the power of a political party. In my opinion, gerrymandering is the greatest scourge on our political landscape, followed closely by the Citizens United decision (although I am open to persuasion on what might be worse). 

If I am selected, I look forward to learning about the opinions and concerns of the people across the state of Colorado as they relate to redistricting, and I will do my best to be fair and impartial. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Listening and understanding go a long way to promote consensus. I can&#39;t say that I have any specific skills when it comes to creating agreement, other than listening, repeating, and being able to separate out feelings, judgments, opinions, and facts. I think that addressing concerns and finding what people have in common will set the framework for reaching consensus. However, let&#39;s be frank, there will be people who are only interested in benefiting their political party and aren&#39;t really interested in consensus. We have to acknowledge that there will be challenges when dealing with competing interests, and so I&#39;ve learned to ask &#39;what&#39; questions instead of &#39;why&#39; questions, in order to draw out underlying motivations. 

One of the reasons I never affiliated with a political party is because the level of partisanship is disheartening. It&#39;s impossible to be fair or impartial when you are jockeying for position or political majority and then retaliating against the other party once you have gained power. My fairness is grounded in the fact that we are all human and worthy of compassion and being heard, even if I don&#39;t agree with you. I don&#39;t think anyone is completely impartial, but if we can be aware of our biases, then we can make significant steps toward achieving impartiality. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Logic and reason is my default behavior when I look at any issue. As an I.T. professional who deals with databases and logic, all day, it would be fair to state that the ability to apply logic and reason is not only core to my job, but it is probably my greatest skill.  From troubleshooting when something isn&#39;t working to foreseeing what issues might occur from a given design, I have always excelled at most problems that require an application of logic, unless it&#39;s a mechanical problem, in which case I throw up my hands and have someone else fix it.
