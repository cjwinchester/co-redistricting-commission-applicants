        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Chester Wang</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Chester Wang
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Chester Wang</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Senior Associate at UBS Financial Services
Financial Advisor at Merrill Lynch
Business Banker at JPMorgan Chase
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I attended and obtained my Bachelors degree with an emphasis of Finance from the University of Colorado at Boulder Leeds School of Business.  I have my series 7 and 66 securities licenses with FINRA. I am fluent in Mandarin and intermediate level in French after studying in Paris and playing professional hockey in Paris.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80020
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not donated to any campaigns or organizations
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I was a part of the Denver Asian Chamber of Commerce, Boulder Rotary club, volunteer at Junior Achievement.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My experience in organizing, representing, and advocating for has come from my line of work. I organized seminars, luncheons, after work Happy-Hours with HR professionals to educate plan participants to ensure they are on track for retirement. Any of these types of events are at the best interest of people who are attending. Too often things have been done for personal gain rather than what is best for the individual.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Since I was old enough to vote, I have continued to see change in this country. There has been change for the better and change for the worse. I want to serve on this commission for one very important reason. To make every individual voice count. Too often, partisan efforts to redraw districting lines has had a greater negative effect on our voting than a positive one. To be short, Gerrymandering has effectively silenced voices and suppressed votes. This idea that &quot;my vote won&#39;t make a difference&quot; is not something a democracy should see. Every vote should count. District lines should not be drawn for political advantage, rather to ensure that each individual feels as thought their voice is heard and have adequate representation.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Promoting consensus has nothing to do with political party. I approach problems with logic. By openly communicating, actively listening, understanding perspectives, and showing respect, we will be able to have a deeper understanding of commissioners points of view. Logic alone won&#39;t win over anyone. You must tie in the human factor (emotion/empathy). Topics exist on paper. Too often, they remain on paper as people bicker back and forth. By introducing the human factor, you are able to bring the topics to life. There is no wrong or right. There exist only ideas. If I am able to be successful on this front, then I believe that I can successfully promote consensus.

In regards to being fair or impartial, I do not and will not consider myself above my own beliefs indicated above. It is about collectively working together. I intend to practice what I preach and put myself in the position of others. That is the only way to remain impartial. All ideas deserve the light of day.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I went to school to study Finance. A lot what I learned and what I do are analytical in nature. When I study the health of a company there are so many aspects to consider (present day cash flows, future cash flows, macroeconomic/microeconomic factors). These are analytical tools that I have to work with daily and apply in my profession.

Putting thoughts on paper in this application is one thing, but talking to someone and being personable is another. I hope for the opportunity to speak and the honor to serve on this commission.
