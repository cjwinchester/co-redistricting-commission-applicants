<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not contributed to any direct campaigns since 2015.  I do contribute monthly to the Human Rights Campaign and have done so for many years.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Professional Organizations:
-Colorado Behavioral Healthcare Council - 1999 to present, Board President, 2017-2020; Behavioral Health Organization Committee Chair, 2014 – 2016; Community Mental Health Center Committee Chair, 2016 to 2018

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have spent 30 plus years working in the human services field.  During this time, I have spent many hours participating in meetings at the state and federal level with Senators and Representatives to both educate and advocate for issues pertaining to the behavioral health field.  I annually attend Hill Day in Washington D.C. , arranged by The National Council to meet with members of the Legislative Branch.  I also attend the Colorado Behavioral Health Care Council&#39;s annual Day at the Capital to meet with Senators and Representatives who serve The Center for Mental Health&#39;s service region.  I regularly attend or listen to the Colorado Joint Budget Committee hearings to fully understand the challenges with financing.

I have just completed a three-year term as the President of The Colorado Behavioral Healthcare Council.  Part of my responsibilities included meeting monthly with members of the Governor&#39;s Cabinet and to work collaboratively to weave together solutions that benefited both the provider community and the State.  I worked to build consensus within the different membership categories to ensure all views were being adequately represented in legislative efforts.

As the CEO for The Center for Mental Health, I&#39;m responsible for the oversight of behavioral health services in Gunnison, Hinsdale, Delta, Montrose, Ouray and San Miguel counties.  In this role, I work daily with a variety of public servants, elected officials, and private sector leaders.  This six-county region is very diverse politically and economically.  I often find myself in a convening and organizing role. 

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have lived in both the Front Range area and now in the rural Western Slope of Colorado.  The needs and issues from these two distinct regions are very different.  I want to serve on this commission to ensure the needs of all Coloradans are effectively represented in our voting districts.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
While I am registered as a Democrat, I do not vote exclusively any one ticket.  I feel Colorado is extremely diverse and think our voting districts need to represent that uniqueness. With the growth occurring in more metropolitan areas, I think it is important to represent the needs of rural ranchers, farmers, miner, and others living in smaller communities.  As the CEO of a company, I am tested every day to be impartial and ensure decisions take into account all sides of an issue.  Throughout my lifespan, I have been in many leadership positions (paid and volunteer) that require consensus building.  This is an area of strength for me and I&#39;ve received accolades through the year for bringing about win-win situations.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I tend to make data-driven decisions after weighing all of the potential gains and risks of a situation.  I&#39;m required to analyze complex contracts as part of my job.  When unsure, I regularly seek legal and other consultation.
