<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
As a founding member of NASTAP (Native American Sacred Trees and Places), I have been heavily involved in preserving, interpreting, and educating the public about historic and archaeological sites on both public and private lands in Colorado.This group is dedicated to identifying, interpreting, and preserving important Native American cultural sites. Additionally, we have been able to collaborate with members of the Southern Ute Reservation who have helped this group interpret important sites and communicate their importance to land-owners, public land administrators and other stake-holders. Even more importantly, NASTAP has been involved in bringing Ute youth from the reservation back to their ancestral lands along the front range. I have participated in numerous capacities with these young people in roles ranging from cook to video session moderator. NASTAP holds an annual conference that includes Ute youth, and provides an all-expenses-paid trip to the conference for Ute youth and elders. Additionally, this group funds the research of Dr. James Jefferson, a Ute elder who holds a PhD in linguistics, is the president of NASTAP, and carries out field research throughout Colorado. The work of this group is extremely important to me because of my family’s dedication to preserving Ute and Comanche sites found on my mother’s ranch and also because of the importance of Native Americans to our nation’s history and culture. And, on a personal level, I have learned a tremendous amount from the Native Americans, especially the elders, who participate in the group.

Another group that I have advocated for in a variety of ways is new teachers and teacher candidates. As an experienced teacher working with a high percentage of diverse and at-risk students, I felt that I needed to pass on the knowledge I had gained throughout my career. I served in the official capacity of mentor for many years as part of the Colorado Department of Education’s licensing requirement for new teachers. I have also had seven student teachers and have helped all of them gain their Colorado teaching certificates. Helping forge new teachers involves a variety of skills, with empathy being one of the most important. For example, one of my student teachers was involved in a program through UCCS that helped former military members become teachers. This person was a Marine who had seen front-line action in Iraq, had lost several members of his unit in combat, had sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and a broken hip. Needless to say, there were days when he needed a great deal of support from me, which I was more than willing to provide. At one point he needed a break away from the rigors of teaching, and so I house-sat for him and took care of his dogs so that he could take a much-needed break. I was also able to diffuse a tricky situation with a parent who was unhappy with my student teacher simply by drawing out her empathy. Patience, collaboration, and clear communication are other skills that are very necessary for working with those just entering the teaching field.

Additionally, I brought the National Geographic Geography Bee to Skyview Middle School; this is an international competition, similar to the National Spelling Bee, which encourages students to become well-versed in geographic fundamentals and concepts. I was able to persuade the principal to foot the bill for this activity and then became the building coordinator. In this capacity I was able to help formulate teams throughout the school and oversee the implementation of the competition. At the end of the competition, one student emerges as the school winner and is then able to compete at higher levels. Being the coordinator of this project for a building of more than seventy faculty members and over 1200 students helped me use my organizational and collaboration skills. I was particularly pleased to see that I build a robust organization that continues at Skyview even though I retired at the end of last school year.

Another organization that I worked with at Skyview Middle School was Knowledge Bowl. I was the co-sponsor of this activity, which consisted of daily practices with a team of sixth-graders followed by competition at a regional event. My team placed in the top three teams at the regional finals every year that I coached them and provided an excellent opportunity for our gifted and talented students to participate in an intellectual event while developing social ties with other gifted students. Advocating for advanced students continues to be one of my passions as they are a group that is often underfunded and underserved.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have always been very involved in politics on  the local and state level. For this election cycle I have written to registered  voters encouraging them to get out and vote. Additionally, I have been involved in phone banking  to help folks formulate a plan for actually voting. I have also participated in door-to-door canvassing in Colorado Springs on weekends and after work. I find this work extremely rewarding. Additionally, I have acted as an election judge on several previous elections. Furthermore, I always attend the caucuses and have stood for a candidate at several of these. This grassroots political activity is very important to me and is, I feel, the lifeblood of our democracy. I fully intend to continue my political activity in the future.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
As a classroom teacher, I have belonged to the National Education Association (NEA), the Colorado Education Association (CEA), the Pikes Peak Education Association (PPEA), and the Falcon Teachers Association (FTA) for thirty-five years, from 1985 to the present.  These groups advocate for public schools and public school children in a variety of different ways. I have participated with the groups by not only being a member, but by also serving on outreach committees to advocate for new teachers.

Additionally, I have been very active in 4-H, a group that provides leadership training and other skills to youngsters aged six to eighteen. As a child I was involved as a member and as an adult I have been a leader at the Kit Carson 4-H club where I was able to mentor children and young adults who were involved in the poultry and leadership programs. This meant preparing for the state and county fairs and resulted in my club bringing home many prizes including Stockman of the Year, Grand Champion, Bird of Show and many other awards. Through this process I was able to help students grow in terms self-confidence, empathy, creativity, and collaboration.

Further, I hold membership in NCHE, the National Council of History Educators. I was honored to be chosen to present at the NCHE conference in Richmond, Virginia as a representative of the Teaching American History grant (TAH). I moderated a session at this conference as well as submitted a peer-reviewed video I created on the importance of the horse to Plains Indians culture. The theme of that year’s conference was, “Recounting Emancipation: Women, Circumstance and Jazz.” This event brought together educators from throughout the United States as well as from abroad, and we were able to meet to discuss continuing the work of emancipation by building on the legacy of the past.

Additionally, the Teaching American History grant was a multiple-year program that I participated in, geared to improving the civic engagement of public school students. TAH stressed the importance of critical thinking, creativity, leadership, and collaboration in teaching School Studies, and also identified these as measures of success for students in Social Studies classes throughout Colorado. As part of this program, I was instructed by university professors, historians, authors, and other professionals. I was also able to collaborate with and learn from some of the best teachers throughout the Pikes Peak region. As a result of this program, Social Studies instruction has dramatically changed. No longer is this discipline one of rote memorization of names and dates—it is now a vibrant field dedicated to building skills including critical analysis, creativity, and civic action.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
When I discovered that I would be able to apply for this redistricting commission, I was absolutely thrilled. One of the reasons for this elation is my background working in Title 1 schools. I have been a public school teacher for thirty-five years and one of the things I learned early in this profession is how important correct districting is to real people in the real world. It may seem like an abstract or incidental process, but it is absolutely essential to the correct functioning of our republic as well as fairness to the public. What I saw happening in the Title 1 schools I worked in, was that invaluable resources were being sucked into other districts through gerrymandering. This left vulnerable, at-risk students without the resources they desperately need to overcome the various and numerous obstacles that lie between them and success. Furthermore, incorrect districting leaves many with no voice in their government; politicians should not be allowed to pick the people they serve. It is absolutely critical that politicians serve the people who reside in their neighborhoods and districts as they naturally stand.
Moreover, I am extremely interested in maps, cartography, and geography - all things that are closely tied to redistricting. When I was an undergraduate at the University of Denver, I was the research assistant for Dr. John Livingston, chair of the Department of History. In this capacity I poured over maps with him as we analyzed geographic information that he needed for his scholarly writings. Eventually I was made curator of the map and slide collections for the Department of History, a job that I absolutely loved.

This love of maps has served me well in other capacities as well. As a Social Studies teacher for my entire career, geography was a cornerstone of the curricula I taught. Additionally, this propelled me to become a National Geographic certified teacher, which required a rigorous process of online learning, collaboration with a cohort of National Geographic staff and other educators, design and implementation of lesson plans, collaboration with colleagues, and creation of a capstone project. In addition to that, I was chosen by National Geographic from an international pool of applicants to attend their Summer Institute for a week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. This week entailed intense training in geographic issues, including redistricting. At the conclusion of this workshop, the participants were tasked with training other teachers on the National Geographic framework for educators. This framework includes a commitment to diversity, collaboration, helping students become active citizens, and empathy for all who share our planet. I was able to lead the middle school where I worked through this process during a day of staff development that met with great success. Although the pandemic has brought this collaboration to a temporary halt, I fully intend to continue training other teachers and helping them earn their National Geographic certification as well.

Last and perhaps most importantly, I want to give back to my community. As a recently-retired teacher, I do not want to spend the rest of my life loafing or resting on my laurels. Civic engagement is a core component of who I am and one of the primary reasons I chose to teach Social Studies, rather than any other subject, for my career. Serving as a redistricting commissioner would allow me to continue to engage in very important matters, but in a different capacity. I would be extremely honored to be considered for this position.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Fairness is a value that is very important to me and is why I became a teacher in schools with a high percentage of at-risk, poor, and disadvantaged students. I felt that it was very important that these youth receive an excellent education, and I was determined to provide this to the best of my ability and I pursued this throughout my thirty-five year career in education. This is the same spirit that I would bring to the redistricting committee.

Additionally, I have had a great deal of experience with building consensus. With the exception of my college years, I have always lived in rural areas. This has resulted in me having quite different political views than my neighbors. However, this has also led me to being very open-minded and objective on many levels. It is impossible to live in a community and be at odds with its members, so I have learned to carefully listen to varied opinions while gently yet firmly sharing my own ideas. This process is a careful balancing act, but it results in harmonious relationships and community building.

Similarly, I have had a wealth of experience with consensus building in my job as a public school teacher. This position brings with it a variety of stakeholders from students and parents, administrators, the Board of Education, the community, and others. Navigating this labyrinth of conflicting ideas, agendas, and backgrounds has led me to understand the importance of holding true to one’s own values while also incorporating the views and ideas of others.
Pursuant to my quest for fairness and opportunity for all, I have also participated in the Educating Children of Color Conference, held at Colorado College, every year since its inception. This conference emphasizes the important role played by teachers in helping children of color obtain an excellent education, and features nationally recognized speakers and thinkers on this topic. Again, I was able to bring new ideas back to my school and other teachers at the conclusion of each of these workshops.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Using, developing, and fostering the use of logic, analysis, and reason, rather than emotion, is very important to me. Teaching Social Studies is, in fact, instructing students in the development of analytical skills, logic, and reason. I was one of the first teachers at Skyview Middle School to bring the use of document-based questions (DBQ’s) to the middle school. This pedagogy involves teaching students to read and analyze primary source documents and then apply that knowledge to answer open-ended questions. Unfortunately, this strategy often is limited to high school instruction, something that I was determined to end and—I am happy to report—that when I retired from Skyview Middle School, most, if not all Social Studies teachers were using this instructional strategy. So, I have had a great deal of experience in not only using logic, analytical skills, and reason, but also in teaching its use to other teachers as well as middle school students.

Additionally, I have more than ninety post-graduate recertification, college, and CDE credits. This is far beyond what is required to maintain my Colorado teaching license. I have chosen to spend a great deal of my time furthering my education, especially in the areas of critical thinking, applying logic, and problem solving. One example of this is that I have accrued many credit hours from the Bill of Rights Institute, an organization that promotes clear-headed thinking and teaching about the US Constitution. I will continue to pursue professional and personal development through continuing education classes, despite my retirement from the education field.

One of the activities that has helped me hone my analytical skills is debate. While I was in high school I was on the debate team and proudly brought home many trophies for participation in both cross- examination debate and extemporaneous speaking. When I began teaching at Sierra HIgh School, I volunteered to be the assistant debate coach. Both the participation and coaching of this logic-based activity helped me develop critical thinking skills and also the ability to see the merit in both sides of an issue. The structure of competitive debate is that all participants argue both sides of an issue, so it is important that facts and logic—rather than biases or passions—rule the day. Similarly, in extemporaneous speaking, a random issue is given to the competitor who then has twenty minutes to prepare a speech over the topic to present to judges. These issues usually relate to current events and, again, the use of logic, reason, and analytical thinking rule the day with the judges.

In short, being selected for this commission would be the culmination of much of my life’s work. My recently completed career in education, in addition to my own ever-continuing education, have given me the analytical skills, steady-handed leadership in teamwork, and ability to apply logic and reason to make me an excellent candidate for this very consequential redistricting commission. I thank you for your consideration.
