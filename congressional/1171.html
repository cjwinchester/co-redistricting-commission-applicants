  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>

  Senior Director, Federal Regulatory Affairs, Xcel Energy.  In current position since 2009.  Have worked for Xcel Energy since 2005.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>

JD, University of Texas, 1985
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>

  80228
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In 2018, donated to Amendment X and Y campaign ($50 if I recall correctly).  In 2016, donated to Hillary Clinton and Michael Bennett campaigns (if I recall correctly, not more than $200 combined).  In 2018, think I may have donated to Brittany Petterson and Max Tyler, though not sure and cannot remember amounts.  In 2020, donated to Joe Biden (less than $100) and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (less than $100).  I think in 2018 I donated to Doug Jones from Alabama (less than $100).  And I have donated to campaign of Velva Price, Travis County, Texas District Clerk (roughly $200 if I recall correctly).  I contributed to the mayoral campaign of Adam Paul--cannot remember the year or the amount, but the amount was small ($50 or less).
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
1.  City Year Denver.  Served as a mentor to a recent college graduate working for City Year in Denver public schools. 
2.  Since 2017, have volunteered as a mentor for Minds Matter Denver (now Minds Matter Colorado) with the goal of getting two young men from less advantaged backgrounds in to college.  We meet with mentees every Monday when school is in session for 2-3 hours and then assist with essay writing, college applications, financial aid applications as needed outside of regular sessions.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My advocacy work primarily revolves around my position with Xcel Energy where I lead internal teams across multiple business areas and often in collaboration with other utilities to develop strategies and proposals.  Work can often be technical and even among other utilities and internally often involves differing viewpoints that need to be fully vetted and consensus on approaches reached.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Partisan redistricting distorts the political process and dilutes the ability of voters to choose their political leaders.  Colorado is at the forefront of levelling the playing field for voters through Amendments X and  Y by implementing districts that are designed to represent the interests of the communities of Colorado, not the interests of incumbents or political parties.  I would very much appreciate the opportunity to help shape the districts that will be in place over the next decade in a manner that accords with the goals of Amendments X and Y.     
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>

My only agenda as it relates to the redistricting process is to draw districts that are fair and meet the goals of Amendments X and Y.  I will approach the process with an open mind and will commit to making the process open and inclusive.  I will listen and give careful consideration to the perspectives of people in communities across the state and to those of my co-commissioners.  I will work to educate myself about the legal and technical aspects of redistricting and use that knowledge to generate reasonable alternatives and find common ground with my co-commissioners.  I think it will be very important to think creatively and outside the box to generate ideas and alternatives and a process that, on the whole, result in a fair process.  I will work very hard to find consensus.  In a matter as important as redistricting, I believe consensus should be a key goal--I don&#39;t think this process can be approached as an I win/you lose proposition.  I want this process to be successful which means that on the whole the public must believe the resulting districts are fair.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I pursued an engineering degree because I have an affinity for math and science and evaluating problems based on facts.  My education and experience as an engineer have equipped me with technical skills and the ability to assimilate and digest complex information.  My education and experience as a lawyer have also equipped me with the ability to evaluate complex social/policy issues and think through all sides to an issue.  I also have the ability to distill information down to its essence and identify the issues that are key to resolution of a problem.  In addition, I have good communication skills that will enable me to communicate effectively with my co-commissioners.
