<h3>Background</h3>

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My organizing career started in 1980 as Student Body President at Las Animas High School in Las Animas, CO.  In that early role, I learned to balance the needs of rural, and “city” interests along with the needs of Latino/a&#39;s, immigrants, and Caucasian community members.  In the early 1990s, I started my own firm that raised money for non-profits throughout the country including Planned Parenthood Chapters, many AIDS service organizations, museums and hospitals. My employees were people who didn&#39;t fit well into society, we called ourselves the &quot;Island of Misfit Toys&quot; and we included: older people. artists, self-described gutter punks, recovering addicts and students.  We were quite the team and raised millions of dollars over the years.  For twenty years, each one of my employees felt like they were a part of the over 50 organizations we raised money for each year.  
I went on to work for the National LGBTQ Task Force in NYC where I traveled the county creating pockets of support for the community, advocating for protections for LGBTQ employees of Federal Contractors, marriage equality and the removal of Don’t Ask Don’t Tell policy.
After a short stint at the NYC LGBTQ Center I returned to Colorado as the Executive Director of Out Boulder County.  In this role, all my organizing and advocacy experience and skills have been put to use.  I joined an organization that claimed to be an LGBTQ organization that served Boulder County but what we were was a Gay and Lesbian organization serving Boulder. Inclusion of the transgender community was my first move.  I had to gain the trust of the trans community and did so by changing existing policies, seeking funding for programming based upon the needs expressed to me by the trans community, adding trans people to the board and to the staff.  We were successful and it is not an overstatement to say that we have the strongest organized trans community in the state of Colorado.
Next up was organizing communities of color.  I followed a similar model but this time I started with program funding first.  With a large grant from the Colorado Health Foundation, I brought together 20 folks of color for a Leadership Summit. Members of this cohort then formed a Queer and Trans People of Color (QTPOC) steering committee to drive ideas and programming for the organization.  We added more people of color to the board of directors and the staff.  Now my organizing feat is to join a mostly white Trans Steering Committee with the QTPOC committee.  
I have been very successful in my advocacy work in Boulder County.  Our County was the first county in Colorado to begin issuing marriage licenses for same-gender couples prior to the Obergfell SCOTUS case; this work included organizing with the County Clerk, faith communities and couples.  Additionally, we have been successful in our advocacy work within school districts, i.e. trans policies, bullying and a concerted effort toward equity.  Our work building LGBTQ Police Liaisons has been highly successful. We have regular trainings with police throughout the Denver Metro area regarding a variety of issues including: language, forms, the X-marker, homelessness and hate crimes. In May 2020, the City of Boulder, changed building policies that now make it mandated to have all-gender bathrooms.  Also, if you have been to Boulder you might notice the rainbow flags painted on crosswalks, that came to fruition in working with City of Boulder Councilmembers, Department of Transportation and the City Manager.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My life’s work has been to create a fairer and ultimately a more equitable world. Racial justice issues are continuing to emerge and the dismantling of structural racism is key to the continuing success of our democratic process.  On a personal note as an LGBTQ activist for the majority of my life I want to ensure that our community is represented fairly and as a 5th generation Coloradan I want to actively engage in ensuring our congress members represent the state of Colorado. 
I have been on the sidelines of political decisions for far too long. I have always voted and have supported a few candidates here and there, but the time has come for me to walk my talk and volunteer my time in a way that benefits all Coloradans. Additionally, I like working with people on important projects and the thought of meeting new people from throughout the state gives me fresh energy.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Residents of Colorado are racially and ethnically diverse, we are members of different faiths or no faith, we are urban and we are rural, we are pro-environment and we are gas and oil people, we live in a variety of family constructs including living alone.  This list could continue ad infinitum.  The key to success in the working with differing interests and different experiences includes: active listening, thinking before you speak and being clear in your motives. One of the strategies I use when talking with someone I don’t agree with is looking for the common interest; there is always a common interest or you aren’t asking the right questions.  I often restate the words shared by the person I don’t see eye to eye before speaking. For example, “John, I heard you say that the urban communities have too much power in the state of Colorado. When you say that, what do you specifically mean by power?”  Consensus can often be reached using these techniques. It is also important to build individual relationships whether that be a coffee date or a one-on-one zoom call.  
As an out lesbian I have met more than one person who has preconceived ideas about me.  In those situations, I always go to the familiar for them: I’m a grandmother, my children are doing x,y,z and I grew up in a little town in Colorado.  We have more similarities than differences and I love finding the similarities to remove the preconceptions.
When I find myself to be most fair and impartial is when analyzing numbers with the caveat that the measurements include different ways of counting interests, experiences and demographics.  We cannot limit are thinking by thinking things are the way they are for a reason; that reason may be an outdated practice.  In general, I am a fair person but I am also a person who has deep beliefs that make impartial in some areas difficult for me. However, when a fair process has been undertaken and every voice has been heard I will join in for consensus.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In my current role as Executive Director I use my analytical skills for budgeting, fundraising, reviewing and digesting research to develop new programs, developing new ways of collecting data, using data to move advocacy areas forward.  Some think I rely too much on logic and reason but it has always served me well.
