        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Sylvia Gaylord Murray</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Sylvia Gaylord Murray
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Sylvia Irene Gaylord</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a Certified Court Interpreter. I provide Spanish-English interpretation in Colorado Courts on civil, criminal, probate, and juvenile matters. The State of Colorado and the City and County of Denver are my largest clients, alongside private clients. Previously, I was an Assistant Professor at the Colorado School of Mines.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a Ph.D. in political science from Northwestern University and a B.A.-M.A. from Johns Hopkins University in international relations. My Ph.D. includes a minor in Quantitative Methods. My qualifications include expertise in statistical software packages, such as STATA, and the mapping software Arc GIS. I speak French and Portuguese, in addition to being bilingual in English and Spanish. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80403
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Through my volunteer work with the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network (RMIAN) I seek to ensure that all people have knowledge of their legal rights and receive due process. My work with RMIAN, however, goes beyond my interpretation assignments and extends to helping immigrants become successful members of our community.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I volunteered for the campaign to elect Phil Weiser as Colorado&#39;s Attorney General and for Mike Johnston&#39;s primary campaign for the Colorado governorship. My husband and I made a campaign donation to John Plumb&#39;s campaign for New York State&#39;s 23rd Congressional District in 2016.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am a pro-bono interpreter with the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network since 2017. From 2017-2019 I worked alongside Humanitas360 conducting research on prison work cooperatives in Latin America.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the commission because I know that the geography of political districts has a large effect on representation. The legislative change that put decennial redistricting in the hands of independent commissions in Colorado is a move in the right direction, as partisan gerrymandering has made congressional races less competitive: by some counts, less than ten percent of the seats in the House of Representatives is filled as the result of competitive elections. In addition to creating safe seats, gerrymandering reduces the incentives of elected representatives to be responsive to the median voter, as gerrymandering allows districts to be &quot;packed&quot; with like-minded voters, and is an obstacle to pluralism through the practice of &quot;cracking&quot;, or diluting the vote likely to elect the opposing party. These factors combined contribute to higher barriers to entry to political office and lower bi-partisanship. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My ability to be fair and promote consensus comes from my years teaching college students and working in the courts. One of the goals of teaching about politics and government is to give students the knowledge and skills to form opinions and defend them. It is the instructorâ€™s responsibility to facilitate class discussion and model appropriate behavior. One technique I have used to facilitate the free exchange of ideas is to collectively agree on a short set of beliefs for opposing points of view on a policy issue, and then assign students to defend a belief, regardless of his/her own stand on the issue. This exercise illustrates that competing points of view can be grounded in acceptable ideas and be the result of sound reasoning. From there, the exercise moved on to the construction of a counter-argument, where students would choose what position to take on an issue. A similar process can be used in other contexts to facilitate consensus.

Working in courtrooms I have learned that impartiality is as much a state of mind, as the result of adhering to procedure. Jurors, for example, can be instructed to follow a set of rules in the evaluation of evidence. This, in turn, can lead to a shared understanding of the evidence and to a consensus-based decision that is informed but not pre-determined by prior held beliefs. The process of first reaching an agreement on the steps to be followed in the evaluation of information can be used in other contexts as a way of facilitating joint decision-making.

Perhaps the hardest goal to achieve in the process of redistricting is fairness. The American system of representation rests on the idea of equality of representation of all people, yet we know that the same vote will either fall in the winning majority or in the losing minority, depending on the location of the district line. If selected to serve on the commission, I will bring all my energy, knowledge, and experience to achieve this ultimate goal.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Perhaps the most intense period of training in analytical and logical skills happened for me during graduate school. There I learned to ask questions that lend themselves to empirical testing and to chose and apply the methodology most appropriate to evaluating potential answers. We delved into topics such as whether we can establish a robust relationship between cause and effect and eliminate alternative explanations for a finding, and whether the same findings can be replicated in other settings. I later taught research methodology for the social sciences at the Colorado School of Mines. With my students I explored issues of omitted variables, selection bias, and missing data. My training as a researcher and my experience teaching others how to ask questions and test answers are well suited to the tasks of the redistricting commission: absorbing large amounts of information, analyzing data, and weighing competing interests. I am experienced in the use of statistical software and familiar with geospatial programs as well (e.g. ArcGIS).
