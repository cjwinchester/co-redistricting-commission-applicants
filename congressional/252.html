<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
When I was involved with the IEEE organization, I helped organize numerous events promoting the Electrical Engineering profession in this state and the industries that hire those professionals.  As an organization, we created networking events, presentations by guest speakers, round table discussions, and even flew to Washington, DC to help lobby for everything from improvements in energy policies to immigration – all areas that would directly or indirectly bring more clean technology jobs to Colorado.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I grew up in a politically active family in a small agricultural town in northern Montana.  During college, I received and political science internship with the Montana State Senate, where I supported the efforts of numerous republican senators.   That internship opened additional opportunities for me to participate in politics, include volunteering for a successful Gubernatorial campaign and being elected as an alternate delegate to the Republican National Convention in New Orleans, LA in 1988.

Within the past year, I have made donations to a mayoral race in Thornton (Jan Kulmann) and a race for District Attorney for the 17th Judicial District (Tim McCormack).  I have also made contributions this year to The Lincoln Project within the last year.

Other than these donations, I have not been very politically active over the past five years.  

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
My career  has kept me from being more involved than I desire, but I am happy to say that I was an active volunteer for 13 years for Stargate School in Thornton, CO until the spring of 2019 when my youngest son graduated from that school.

As a Stargate volunteer, I donated time to the school in a variety of capacities: I helped the school with its information technology systems, chaired their Website Committee, and most importantly, chaired their Election Committee where we organized, executed, and ratified two elections per year with over 1000 stakeholders whereby we elected board members, elected committee members, and adopted changes to the bylaws.  Volunteering for Stargate was extremely rewarding.

I am currently a member of Mosaic Lodge #184 AF&amp;AM, in East Lake, CO, a member of the Denver Consistory, a Shriner (Shriners Children’s Hospitals), a member of the Advisory Committee of the Broomfield Chapter of DeMolay, and a former Section Chair of the Denver Section of IEEE (Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers).
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The redistricting commission is the first of its kind in Colorado, and I see it as a very exciting opportunity for getting involved, giving back to the State of Colorado, and working on the cause of equal representation that is greater than any one person.

I would like to serve on the commission because I want to apply my problem-solving skills that I have refined throughout my career to public service.   I have enjoyed volunteering throughout my life, I have enjoyed taking on new challenges, and I also enjoyed collaborating with others to find solutions, and I view becoming a member of the commission as a natural extension.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The first and most important step promoting consensus among the commissioners is to never loose sight of the commission’s objectives and responsibilities.  

As the commission considers options for redistricting, the second step to promoting consensus is to ensure that the options for a new congressional district map are based on facts and data from the census and input from the public hearings.  

Armed with consensus on our responsibilities, equal access and understanding of the data, and education from the feedback from the public hearings; the committee will then be on a strong foundation for aligning on a congressional map that best servers Colorado.

I believe this approach will achieve consensus among the commissioners, makes the commissions’ work as fair and impartial as possible, and creates a map that is justified by facts, and not rhetoric or political whims.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My education has instilled in me a strong sense of logic and reason.  In addition, analysis, critical thinking, and ongoing education are critical skills that I continue to rely upon in my profession protecting data, keeping computers secure, defending against cyber threats, and staying one step ahead of hackers in our technology-driven word.

Throughout my career, I have been pragmatic professional where I have used my analytical skills to make the best decisions, even if the information available is not perfect.  In those cases where information is vague or contradicts itself (and that seems to happen frequently), I have used logic, reasoning, communication, collaboration, and courage to find the best solution possible.
