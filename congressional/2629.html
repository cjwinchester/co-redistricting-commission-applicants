</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>

  80304
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
None.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I was not affiliated with any party until November 10, 2016, when I joined the Democratic Party. Since then, I have donated a small amount monthly ($10) to the DNC and small amounts ($50 or less usually) to several campaigns in 2018 and 2020, including Pete Buttigeg, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and a committee to elect Democratic Senators. I may have also donated money to VoteVets, a progressive but not Democrat, political group. I am not referencing any records so this may not be a comprehensive listing.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have volunteered by teaching English with Intercambio Connecting Communities (Boulder, CO) and I’m a driver for Meals on Wheels of Boulder.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
This is an important civic duty and I learned that women are underrepresented on both commissions. I am not currently employed or seeking paid employment, but I have been considering ways to make a difference during a challenging time. As a fairly new Coloradan, I want an opportunity to contribute to making this state an even better place to live. As an American, I can give back to my country by helping to make this effort a successful example for others. The future of our democracy depends on bipartisan and nonpartisan efforts to ensure our system is fair and that voters have confidence in that system.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I was a leader in the Air Force and the Air Force Reserve for 27 years, dealing with contentious issues and brokering agreement among multiple stake holders constantly. I’m a good listener who asks a lot of questions and seeks to understand motivations without judging those motivations. People care about what they care about and I encourage everyone to be open and honest, which fosters an atmosphere of fairness.  Most situations are not a zero sum game and I strive to ensure other people see that. I am usually successful in helping others reframe their thinking about issues and/or seeing how narrow issues fit into a larger picture or higher purpose.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I was an Intelligence Officer, so critical thinking, analysis, and helping decision makers understand complex problems and threats was my whole job. I was involved in numerous efforts to define new threats, which requires creating analytical frameworks and methodologies. If you have seen the new Colorado COVID dial dashboard - that is a good example of the kinds of projects I worked on - defining threat levels and corresponding risk assessments/mitigation measures. From 9/11 onward, I led teams analyzing terrorism and terrorist networks in Europe, and most recently, I was assigned to US Strategic Command, where I led large teams (30+) during nuclear weapons employment exercises requiring analysis of Russia’s and China’s nuclear weapons and space programs.
