<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have occasionally volunteered for specific campaigns during election years; I have contributed funds to specific candidates. I attend my local caucus and occasionally helped in my local caucus proceedings. I have never earned money from any campaign or political organization. In 2019, I gave $250 to the Andrew Romanoff campaign. I gave the Elizabeth Warren campaign $540 in 2020. I gave the Joe Biden campaign $750 in 2020. In 2016, I served as secretary of my precinct during our caucus.  As a result of that service, I was asked to serve on a vacancy committee to replace District 31 Senator, Lois Court in January of 2020. I was simply a voter and took no other part in the vacancy committee work.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have been a member of the Colorado Democratic Party since moving here in 2002. I am also member of the Colorado Beekeeping Association. I am a member two different groups concerning the study of Japanese flower arrangement, Ikebana International and Sogetsu Colorado. I am also a member of Growhaus. The mission of The GrowHaus is to cultivate community-driven food justice through education and food access in the Globeville and Elyria-Swansea neighborhood of Denver. I have been a member of the Human Rights Campaign, the American Civil Liberties Union and Southern Poverty Law Center.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I do not have experience advocating for any specific group in Colorado, but I do have experience working among individuals representing a diverse group of legal professionals from across the state. Recently, I was contracted by the State of Colorado Office of Victim Programs to assist a multi-faceted steering committee. The work of the committee was to apply Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) funds to various Colorado populations to increase the access and provision of civil legal services to victims. I created GIS maps of Colorado using census data (American Community Survey); created an inventory of all agencies providing victim services; and identified communities where victim services were especially low and where the percentage of vulnerable people was unusually high. The steering committee represented organizations across the state, and had specific interests such as disabilities populations, victim rights, immigration, rural communities and economics. I was able to pursue data requested by anyone in the group and help align, compare and prioritize different types of data so that we could combine spatial datasets into models.  I created spatial economic models combining different variables, such as unemployment and poverty. Many of these economic models were compared to other geographic models, such as The Colorado Self-Sufficiency Standard Index. We also looked at social vulnerability through demographic factors, including disabled populations, age, race and ethnicity, foreign born and native language. Combining various iterations of these models provided a way to capture geographic areas considered as underserved. This work provided me with a unique awareness of Colorado communities and characteristics as well as insights into the concerns of citizens living throughout the state. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I consider gerrymandering one of the most critical problems in a functioning and fair democracy. I want to work on the commission because it is a specific way for me to serve the community to foster a better functioning democracy using my personal toolset. I make maps for a living; thus, I understand many of the complexities the commissioners and the staff will face creating maps and communicating them to the public. Further, I have extensive experience with Colorado census data including the decadal censuses (2000, 2010) as well as the American Community Survey datasets. I recently wrote a report for the State of Colorado summarizing the population changes between 2010 and the 2014-2018 ACS dataset. Having trained as a scientist and worked for United States Geological Survey (USGS), my personal toolbox includes natural curiosity, reason and analytical skills as well as strong interpersonal skills.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have three skillsets that I believe will help me foster fairness and consensus among the commissioners. First, I have experience with strategic planning, which is an invaluable tool for finding consensus in diverse groups. I was formally employed by an economic development company that used strategic planning to assist rural communities to rebuild and develop their economic base. I have frequently relied on my experience with strategic planning to lead different groups through basic strategic planning processes. Second, I have experience serving as a Court Appointed Special Advocate in Oregon. Serving as a CASA taught me how important it is to listen to all participants with respect, regardless of my own opinions and advocacy role. Third, as a scientist, I understand that fairness and objectivity are critical in all aspects of work from data collection, to statistical analysis as well as conclusions and paper publications.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have over 20 years of experience making maps for a diverse group of clients such as the federal government, the State of Colorado, and Department of Justice. I’ve also published eight papers in well-respected scientific journals. These publications and my employment history serve as examples of my analytical skills and ability to reason. I am a broad thinker; my scientific work extends from geology to biogeochemistry to psychology and geography. Before turning to school to study geology I spent about 10 years working in the world of finance and contracts. I’m not someone who gets uncomfortable addressing an issue or problem that is new to me. Curiosity may be the most important analytical skill that I have to offer.
