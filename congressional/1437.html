<p>
For the past five years I have worked for the Douglas County Federation, and have served as an officer, including President, of the American Federation of Teachers for the State of Colorado.

That is to say, I organize and support educators through their professional association both in Douglas County and state-wide. I handle all employee issues that arise between our members and their respective place of employment. My experience as a Human Resources Director, and negotiations facilitator has been invaluable in building relationships and problem solving.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Ensuring the equality of representation between districts in the face of population growth and migration in Colorado is critical.  It is important to me that the redistricting process ensures that all Colorado citizens, regardless of their location, receive equal representation to maintain election integrity. I have lived in both rural and urban settings. It is extremely important that boundary lines are drawn in such a way that avoids personal and partisan bias as well as marginalization. 
I believe that I bring a unique knowledge base and skill sets that will strengthen the capacity of the commission to identify goals, have difficult discussions, and ultimately build consensus. I am a trained mediator, team builder, facilitator, and Interest Based negotiator. I understand the stages, and benchmarks of healthy group development, have the ability to not personalize other’s frustrations, and am able to maintain a neutral posture.  I have led many groups through the process of negotiation including goal and interest identification, data and historic analysis, option development, and consensus decision making. I also understand that focusing on mutually agreed upon interests, rather than personal agendas, allows a group to better maintain the big picture and reach a mutually agreed upon conclusion. 
To be sure, the process of redistricting will not be easy. Decisions made will have profound impacts for a decade.  I believe that I bring experience and skills that will enhance the functionality and integrity of this crucial commission.

<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
There are numerous “style” surveys available to determine the strengths and areas of growth in learning and leadership. After participating in these surveys, I routinely am identified as someone with high analytic skills. It is important to me to have data and information upon which to make decisions. I seek out information relevant to the situation, consider multiple options, identify positives and potential areas of difficulty, and ultimately make data driven decisions. Context is important to me. I need to know why things exist as they do, and why changes/improvements are being made. To that end, I ask relevant questions, listen, and work to understand why things are as they are before moving forward.
