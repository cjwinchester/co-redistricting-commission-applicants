<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>

Starting in 2019 I have been working hard to establish the Grand Valley Parks and Recreation Foundation, I am serving as their Treasurer.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have served as a member and officer of CHECO (Colorado Higher Education Computing Organization), serving on the CIO Council with all higher ed CIOs and served on CHECO Board of Directors (a peer elected position). I spoke up for those higher education institutions that are away from the Front Range corridor, to assure all voices were heard on various issues. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have studied and worked on environmental science and land use planning for my entire career, in Vermont and in Colorado from 1971 through today. I have the perspective of elected officials, government employees serving communities, counties, states and at the federal level (5 years for the USGS). I believe the districts we define to represent our elected officials&#39; areas and serve our communities should be based on a sound analysis of many factors including population, economic efforts in the districts such as manufacturing, agriculture, recreation, and education, the natural environment and its resources or challenges, and projected change to these factors over the time between census data collections.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have been an unaffiliated voter, as well as a registered Republican and now a registered Democrat over my lifetime. I believe I will support listening to, as well as advocating for, a balanced assessment of all natural, social, and economic factors within the constraints of drawing sound District boundaries. Since I first registered to vote when I turned 18 during my senior year in high school, I have never failed to vote in any election, no matter how large or how small. I have always probed the various issues (it&#39;s the scientist in me) and frequently asked questions of the candidates and about the ballot issues before making up my mind how or who to cast my vote for. In 2000-2005, I served the Association of Vermont Independent Colleges as the state-wide Information Technology Coordinator. This effort led to inter-institutional coordination on strategic planning, staff training, and providing up-to-date student resources among a diverse group of affluent institutions (e.g. Middlebury College in Middlebury, VT) and small, sometimes specialized institutions (e.g. Landmark College in Putney, VT). So I have experience promoting consensus and cooperation among disparate players in various groups with a wide variety of resources and goals.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Thoughtful analysis is something I learned during my education to become a Professional Geologist, and my later career as a leader during the information revolution of the last 50 years. For me, analyzing the natural conditions, the historical developments (successes and failures), any existing societal establishments and community organizations, has always led me to learn new things, add those to my education and experience, and then make well-reasoned suggestions to organizations or committees I&#39;ve served on or worked in support of. I believe the most important thing in successful analyses leading to problem-solving is to listen to others and make suggestions that incite them to think, and speak up, always enticing others to consider alternative choices and innovative solutions. As an educator (at Dartmouth College on New Hampshire and at Western Colorado University in Gunnison), I have spent a substantial amount of time teaching others to use tools (often personal computer tools) to discover new data or correlations with their thoughts and speak up when considering solving a new problem or instituting a modified solution strategy for an old problem.
