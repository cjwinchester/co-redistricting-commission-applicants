<p>
  80033-6262
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
As a judicial officer I have refrained from this activity. I have attended several meetings with staff members of Senators Bennett and Gardner regarding judicial confirmations, especially, but not as a representative of any party or organization. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am a member or past member of the Colorado Supreme Court Standing Committee on Civil Rules; Colorado Bar Association; Colorado Women&#39;s Bar Association; Colorado Municipal Judges Association; Thompson Marsh Inn of Court. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Again, as a judicial officer I have refrained from most of these activities. I was a Parish Social Ministry Coordinator for Catholic Community Services from 1985-1987, and in that capacity I instructed parish leaders in the archdiocese in community organization and service. I represented members of the Arvada City Council in a land use and Open Records Act dispute that ultimately resulted in the creation of the Two Ponds National Wildlife Refuge. I assisted Shelley Cook and the City of Arvada in obtaining a PUC permit for the A-Line non-profit airport shuttle. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The non-partisan nature of this process has the potential to invigorate small d democracy in an exciting, uplifting way.  If Coloradans perceive the process to be fair not just at the end of an election cycle but throughout the cycle, they will engage in it throughout the process which will make it more vibrant and responsive.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have been a judicial officer in some capacity for almost 30 years.  I have learned a lot about how to be fair and impartial during that service, and I continue to learn.  I believe it starts with truly hearing all participants&#39; positions, and letting them know they have been heard.  Building consensus is also based on knowledge, on building relationships and shared experience, on stepping forward sometimes, and on stepping aside sometimes, on standing for principle without being rigid and inflexible.  Being innovative can boost consensus, too, provided it is coupled with a recognition that history and  what has gone before is not by definition wrong.  I believe I have attributes, experience, and abilities that will help me bring this understanding of consensus building to active membership on the commission.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In almost 30 years on the bench, I have learned that there is not necessarily one right answer to a problem, and also that the best answers are developed by fully engaging all of the participants in developing that answer.  Here is an example from my experience: The county was laying pipe for a new water line.  Unfortunately, the route of that line ran very close to an ostrich farm; ostriches, it developed from several hours of expert testimony, are extremely sensitive to noise, vibration, and things being raised above their heads, and when they react to those stimuli, they frequently die.  The ostrich farmer wanted an injunction to permanently halt the construction of the water line near his property; the county wanted permission to proceed with the project without modification.  With the help of the parties, I crafted a solution that involved moving the animals in gradual stages until they were at the far edge of the farmer&#39;s property, far enough away from the noise and vibration to be safe.  The project was delayed, but eventually completed; the animals, and the farmer&#39;s livelihood, were not harmed.  This solution required listening to the experts, listening to the legitimate concerns of all of the participants, and applying the expertise to those concerns in a rational way.  Expertise for the sake of expertise is not valuable, but applied logically to a problem it can make a huge, positive difference.
