<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My experience in representing and organizing people in Colorado comes from my Bioengineering degree from the University of Colorado Denver-Anschutz Medical Campus. I was very involved in student organizations centered on academic excellence and the presentation of lab work and research to the larger Aurora and Denver community. The Bioengineering department is a diverse group, including many people of color, genders, sexes, and creeds. I was excited to work with and to assist so many members of the Denver-metro area. 

One specific role was in organizing presentations of student research to the department, larger research community, and public. I was responsible for coordinating times, meeting places, and refreshments for these events. I guided fellow students through the process and helped with presentation prep and practice. It was a great experience for the department and the talks helped students showcase their work. 

In addition, my wife was a teacher for a number of years in Colorado public school systems. Problems and issues that she faced as an educator became my problems as I endeavored to help and support her in her daily goals as an educator. Issues of race, class, and educational attainment remain common subjects of dinner table conversation. Though my wife is no longer a public school teacher, the lessons she taught me about the struggles of her students and fellow educators remain clear as ever. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve the people of our great state because I know my unique skills and life experiences will help ensure a fair and equitable outcome for all Coloradoans. 

My love of data science, statistics, and research makes me well suited for the efforts of the commission. I have extensive research experience in very large, land-area based datasets from my contracting experience with ReMax Real Estate. There, I created algorithms and programs to comb through many old and large datasets to help ensure our clients’ competitive advantage in the real estate market. My experience in vast neuroscientific data analysis from CU and UCLA ensures that I am at home with varied and sparse data analysis. I truly do love just playing around with data and finding critical things that effect the numbers. 

Most importantly, my understanding of the concerns and hopes of Coloradans will make me a great fit for service in this commission. Through many outreach efforts over the years, I have the skills required to take study results and translate them into truthful ideas that even 4th graders can understand. Via the Neuroscience Outreach Program, we took donated cadaver samples to elementary and high schools to help teach neuroscience concepts to children. I remember one little girl’s eyes lighting up when we went over a brain: “Oh, that’s where they put the hole in me!” She had a shunt put into her brain due to hydrocephaly—a swelling of the spinal fluid. We were able to show her and her classmates how her life was saved. Explaining to 4th graders neurosurgery is not any easy matter. 

I want to serve the people of my home, to help, in whatever way I am able, to ensure that voting in this great state is equitable and fair to all of my fellow citizens. I know that I am one of the best people to help make that a reality. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I will, to the utmost of my ability, strive my hardest to promote consensus within the group of my fellow commissioners. I will do this by listening more than I speak, by following the laid down guidelines of the group, and by acting on the evidence at hand. I will strive to create agreement with my fellow commissioners at all times. I will do this by leaving behind my pre-conceived allegiances, by following the system to which we are all accountable to, and by taking the merits of an argument into account regardless of the person making such an argument. I strongly believe that all people are trying their level best to do what is right for others around them. I know that trust building, empathetic listening, and always giving each other the benefit of the doubt will foster a group that can craft the best possible outcome for the people of our great state. 

I will, to the utmost of my ability, be fair and impartial during my time serving on the commission. I know that with the responsibility the commission must shoulder, tensions and emotions may run high. Regardless, I will follow the laws and rules set out for the commission to the letter. I will consider all evidence presented with awareness of my own bias and with an effort to view the situation beyond my own experience. I will make certain, to the utmost of my ability, that my biases will not cloud my judgment. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have extensive skills in data analysis from my Bachelors degree in Applied Physics from the University of California Santa Cruz and my Masters degree in Bioengineering from the University of Colorado Denver-Anschutz Medical Campus. My undergraduate thesis was in materials science and looked at negative thermal expansion in Zirconium Tungstate. Basically, a special little rock that gets smaller as it get hotter, unlike say a steel bridge. My graduate thesis looked at the optical engineering feasibility of a nanoscope (as opposed to a microscope) mounted to the head of a rat for research into the molecular biology of neurological diseases.  Basically, using fiber optics to watch living rats brains in real time. 

My scientific publications are mostly in high pressure and high temperature mineralogy and the study of the carbon cycle in the deep earth. I owe this opportunity to my wife, as these publications comprised her PhD research at UCLA. The research for these publications involved traveling to synchrotron facilities on multiple continents to crush mineral samples between anvils made of pea-sized industrial diamonds. 

My work at UCLA also involved the construction of a novel electrode-placing machine for rats. The machine was chronically mounted to the head of rats and drove electrodes into specific portions of the rat’s head to study the inner working of the brain over months. Additionally, I created a backpack-mounted device to precisely measure the head position of chinchillas for use in sense-of-balance research. 

My work with Symmetricom and Lockheed Martin mostly focused on Department of Defense related contracts. At Symmetricom we built and maintained hyper precise clocks for a variety of clients, mostly in defense, petroleum, and financial markets. At Lockheed Martin I was a researcher for commercial satellite production and also traveled to many high-energy particle accelerators across the US to preform research on the space environment and it’s effect on satellites. 

Besides my professional work, I would like to highlight an article I published on the global real estate market of the year 2099. I considered the effects of expanding space launch operations and the growing commercial markets in space. The question is: where is the most cost effective real estate on Earth to launch from into space? After a dive into many of the factors that could affect the answer, it becomes clear. Due to inherent orbital physics, the geography of the Earth, and the likely population growth in India and Africa, it turns out the most lucrative land for space launches is the small equatorial port city of Kismayo, Somalia at the mouth of the Juba river. The second best is Singapore, however most of the land nearby is already owned and is expensive. 

I hope that my extensive experience in scientific, commercial, and Department of Defense research demonstrates my analytical skills and my abilities to apply logic and reason to complex problems.
