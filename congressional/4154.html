        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Hanna Lei Camp</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Hanna Lei Camp
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a data technology advisor for Mercy Corps, an international humanitarian nonprofit.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  -BA, Linguistics and International Relations - University of California, San Diego (2006) 
-MA, Global Finance &amp; Trade - University of Denver (2013) 
-Over the past 5 years I have studied geospatial analysis, statistical programming, and agricultural systems modeling in the course of my professional work.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80011
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have volunteered to knock doors, do voter outreach, and do data entry for several campaigns in Colorado, especially local Aurora candidates. I have donated money to the following candidates/political organizations: Juan Marcano (Aurora City Council, Ward IV, 2019), Alison Coombs (Aurora City Council, Ward V, 2019), Bryan Lindstrom (Aurora City Council, Ward VI, 2019), Omar Montgomery (Aurora Mayor, 2019), Iman Jodeh (CO House, District 41, 2020), Arapahoe County Democratic Party, Colorado Progressive Alliance
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am an active member and volunteer data coordinator for Aurora Residents for Transparency and Transformation, a civic organization advocating for greater accountability, inclusivity, and responsiveness in Aurora city government. I am also a member of the Posner Center for International Development, a community of organizations and individuals in Colorado who work in international development and share learning and evidence-based best practice.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a part of ARTT, I have worked to generate public good datasets for our local advocacy. For example, I generated a consolidated, harmonized dataset of all Aurora municipal campaign contributions from 2011-present that is open to all Aurora residents and groups, and which has been used by community activists to propose new regulations. I also visualized this data to help others explore and interact with it. I frequently testify at Aurora City Council and meet with councilpersons on matters such as campaign finance ordinances and accessibility of public comment.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Colorado became my home almost ten years ago, and I have seen how we have struggled to create the systems and infrastructure needed for our growing, vibrant population. My involvement in Aurora city advocacy has shown me that Colorado&#39;s future depends on ensuring we have fair and equitable representation at all levels of government, which is accessible to people no matter where they live in Colorado, what hours they work, or what connections they have. I believe passionately that a good process for redistricting is absolutely critical, and want to be a part of making it happen. On a personal level, I love this state and love learning more about its people and geography, and am lucky to be in a position where I can dedicate the time needed to fulfill all the duties this commission would require. I hope very much to have the privilege of serving.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In both my professional and community life, I am evidence-oriented above all. I believe that this mindset will be an asset to the commission, which must carefully consider a complex range of factors in its decision-making. As an experienced data analyst, I know that I am just as susceptible to bias as anyone else, but I also know that I can and do change my mind based on evidence. I have worked with people across the globe who brought perspective and information I didn&#39;t have to the table, and who have changed my mind on topics I thought I was decided upon. I believe I can promote consensus on the commission by carefully understanding the data available to us, probing its limitations, and being an honest and straightforward communicator about what we know and don&#39;t know. In so doing, I believe I can help to build a common understanding and an environment of open collaboration that will be critical for this endeavor.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Due to my professional work, I am experienced in data collection methodologies, data exploration, statistics, mapping and geospatial analysis, and data presentation. My most fundamental approach to any problem is to first ensure I have a clear articulation of the questions that need to be answered, and to then find the available data, dive deep into what it can tell me and what it can&#39;t, formulate a strategy for filling informational gaps, and finally provide clear, accessible representations of my findings. Repetition of this process across many years has built up habits of logical analysis I believe will be well-suited to the commission.
