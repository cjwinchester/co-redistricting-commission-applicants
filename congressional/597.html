<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
My primary experience has been on the Durango 9-R School Board, where we seven and then five board members advocated for and considered the interests and needs of students, teacher, classified staff, business leaders, and the community as a whole. Durango prides itself for being extremely community-minded and has a robust interest in its schools and how they are managed. We are a &quot;purple&quot; area with a liberal bentin town proper and many more conservative-minded folks on the &quot;Dry Side&quot; i.e. the more agricultural areas of Durango. Thus, we must consider widely varying points of views and vastly differing needs of students and their families. Fort Lewis College, a liberal arts college moving into more vocational programming, has a 40%+ Native American student population and many faculty and staff with children in the public schools, and this adds its own dimension and diverse perspective. 

Furthermore, we have three charter schools and were the first district to include the charters in our bond issues because those families also pay taxes and it&#39;s only fair that they then be included in the allotment of funds. As the former program manager for the local adult education center for the high school equivalency (GED) program, I am also a stalwart supporter of making educational opportunities available and free or inexpensive for adults who left high school before graduation. A more educated Colorado populace creates a stronger, healthier citizenry. I believe in second and third chances for adults attaining more education because I understand that &quot;there but for fortune go I,&quot; and the world we live in requires that we all be really flexible, nimble, and capable of accepting and embracing change but not just to jump on a passing educational trend; so much of our mental dexterity and lifelong learning habits depend on our educational system!
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I don&#39;t recall all of my donations since 2015 but I have contributed since 2019 to  the Flip the Senate campaign, Joe Biden, John Hickenlooper, Barbara McLachlan, Diane Mitsch Bush, Marsha Porter-Norton, and Matt Salka.

Methodist Thrift Shop volunteer librarian
La Plata County Democrats Executive Council and Outreach Coordinator
I have donated blood four-five times annually since the late 1980s.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve for many of the same reasons that I served on the school board while working full-time and holding down an extra job as a PT community college instructor: I love Colorado and want everyone who lives here to thrive. Complaining about what is wrong with government does nothing to improve its functionality; only putting our shoulders to the wheel to make it turn--no matter how slowly or seemingly imperceptibly--can ultimately effect positive change and improve lives. I grew up in a family of eight children and learned early on that if I wanted to accomplish something, I had better work for it, and my work ethic has served me extremely well for 50+ years.
Furthermore, in Tom Noel&#39;s excellent reference, Colorado: A Historical Atlas, &quot;Dr. Colorado&quot; explains and lays out the background in text and maps of our congressional districts from 1893 to the present. The new commission will create the seventh iteration but be the first to do so with balanced citizen input and perhaps, with less of a political focus. And with Colorado&#39;s growth since 2010, it is highly likely that an 8th district will be created. While all politics in our large state may not be local, it is certainly regional, and I fully believe that this type of work is work that makes a difference for our state and how fully and fairly its people can be represented in Congress.

Another important point is that as a teacher of many decades, I&#39;m still a believer in doing homework;  while I&#39;m rarely if ever the smartest person in the room, I am sometimes the hardest worker and do a lot of background research to find the best, most accurate solutions or approaches to the issue at hand. I read and absorb information well, make notes, come prepared, and this has been one of the not-so-secret reasons for my success. It is unfortunate, but I have seen many people in positions of power who have *not* done their homework and have thus made poor decisions based on a kneejerk or purely partisan perspective. This cannot be the case on this extraordinarily important venture that Colorado is undertaking. Once the Commission reworks the current gerrymandering of our state, we will have better government; this I truly believe or I would not be willing to put in the great amount of time that this commission will require of me. Luckily, I am in great health and have a positive attitude, so I am up to the challenge!
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
This is perhaps the most critical question you are asking of us as applicants because without consensus, that wheel I wrote of earlier can get awfully jammed. On the many groups I have served in my 20 years in Durango, I learned how to listen and take notes as a way to force myself to hear accurately what the speaker is saying. My nearly 8 years on the school board reinforced this skill and while the board did not always reach consensus or meet our superintendent&#39;s exact wishes, we generally functioned well and moved the district forward to strengthen student achievement, pass major bonds and deal with controversial issues well. As a Democrat who believes that clear, factual information is essential, I will help my group, where necessary when we hit a difficult impasse, to work through decisions as rationally as possible, not based on an intense personal or political agenda.

My background as a program manager who managed nine employees at one time also serves me well. We were a wonderful team at the adult ed center but of course, not all the teachers or support staff agreed all of the time, and employees occasionally clashed. As a result, I learned how to bring conflicting factions together and had them each tell their story. This alone created empathy and a new willingness to understand the other&#39;s perspective. Listening really does matter. Doing one&#39;s homework really does matter. Being willing to compromise and not having to win at all costs really does matter.

Lastly, I served on a federal jury about ten years ago. It was quite an extraordinary case, and I am so proud of how I was able to persuade the lone holdout who did not want to convict the rapist; he kept asking &quot;why didn&#39;t she cry out or try to escape?&quot; This gentleman was only familiar with the flight or fight condition that people in extreme danger or assault often take; he knew nothing about the &quot;freeze&quot; mentality that occurs, especially with victims of sexual assault. Rather than yelling at this man or telling him he was stupid or insensitive, I explained quietly about this third &quot;freeze&quot; state, and he was thankful for the information, and we went back into the courtroom and convicted a very dangerous and violent person. Letting people voice their concerns, listening well, and responding in a way that shows you heard them--not that you were merely waiting your turn to counter--can move that collective wheel forward so that we accomplish our goal for that session/meeting/day.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
For many years, I taught research and essay writing skills, from my first position in Parachute, Colorado with fifth graders through to several high school jobs and many colleges, including Pueblo Community College here in Durango. These analytical skills transfer to the same kind of work the commission will be asked to do. We have a problem/challenge to address, so the first step will be the gathering, reading, and digesting of a great amount of information--population demographics, predicted growth/shrinkage of population; changing economic forces and patterns, immigrant influence--etc. Just obtaining and then parsing clear and accurate information itself will be a challenge, and that is why having a balanced group of folks is so essential to the whole process. I expect this phase to take several months, and as we meet we will try out possible options/solutions/compromises and listen to the obvious and less apparent counter arguments/points of view. As Donald Rumsfeld noted, &quot;there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know.&quot; And of course, there are things we don&#39;t know that we don&#39;t know, and that point leads to one of the ultimate goals of our work on the commission--to have the people of Colorado across this entire state tell us what we don&#39;t know that we didn&#39;t realize we did not know so that we factor in the critical and important information that all of our diverse regions face.

Again, as a teacher of both writing and literature, my understanding of inference and implication will be useful as will defining our terms and having a full understanding of the history and politicization of the congressional redistricting and other problematic aspects.

We will ask ourselves and one another, as well as the Coloradans we visit with and listen to across the state, important  questions and gather those answers, seeking patterns that reveal potential changes where they will benefit our citizens. We will push for brainstorming unanticipated consequences of whatever decisions we might arrive at as a group. We will set ground rules/expectations that examine biases and how to put them aside to achieve the greater good of the commission.

Interestingly, I have faced this problem/solution/question within just the past few months with friends and colleagues who say that they will sit out the 2020 election, a position I can empathize with but not accept easily. All of the skills I have mentioned are ones I have employed, and I am pleased to say that a few people have left the table saying that now they are not sure whether they will indeed sit out this election year after all.
