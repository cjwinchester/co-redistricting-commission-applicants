        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Daniel O&#39;Brien</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Daniel O&#39;Brien
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Daniel Baker O&#39;Brien</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am the Head of School at the High Mountain Institute in Leadville
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  B.A. and M.A., both in History. My MA is from CU-Boulder and my BA is from Middlebury College
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80461
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Please see above. I am deeply involved equity efforts in Lake County and bettering our under-resourced, rural community. I am a founding board member of the Lake County Community Fund, which convenes community agencies, helps fund non-profits, and strives to meet community needs in Leadville/Lake County. I am also been actively involved in the governance and day-to-day operations of the Bright Start Early Learning Center, Leadville&#39;s only childcare center. This effort involves working with state regulatory agencies, elected representatives, and community leaders to meet the critical need for early childhood care in rural Colorado. In the summer of 2020, I brought together Lake County commissioners, Leadville’s mayor, and the LCSD superintendent to help find a new location for Bright Start. I was part of a successful effort to ensure the school district, which is constructing a new elementary school building, received a BEST (restricted educational construction funds from the state) grant waiver to allow it to build sufficient pre-school classrooms for Lake County&#39;s growing population. As part of our response to COVID, I organized other boarding schools that are part of the Association of Colorado Independent Schools to seek interpretations from the Office of the Governor of his public health orders to address the unique situation of boarding schools in our state.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My only political donation I remember since 2015 was approximately $25 to Michael Johnson’s primary campaign for governor in 2018. To be honest, I have spent my free time over the last several years focusing on the needs of my community over electoral politics. I am a regular voter, but have not participated actively in campaigns recently. I worked on Capitol Hill in DC twenty years ago, and I volunteered for then state-representative candidate Dan Gibbs during his first campaign in 2006. I also understand, however, the importance of the electoral process. I try to follow the dictum: &quot;Go where you are useful.&quot; Recently, it has seemed like I could be most useful serving on non-electoral boards and commissions. Now, however, ensuring Lake County has effective electoral representation feels like where I can have the greatest impact. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I sit on the boards of two non-profits, the Lake County Community Foundation and a local preschool, Bright Start Learning Center. Since 2015, I have served on the Finance Committee of the Association of Colorado Independent Schools. I also served in 2016-17 on the organizing committee for Get Outdoors Leadville, which was awarded a multi-million-dollar grant from Great Outdoors Colorado (GOCO). I am a highly active and involved parent in our local school district, Lake County R-1.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The work of this commission will have an enormous impact on my community. This will be the third re-districting cycle I have experienced since I moved to Leadville. Each time, I have seen Lake County placed in districts in which we are on the far periphery; once we were placed in a Colorado Springs-based district and we are now in one centered around Pueblo and the Western Slope. Lake County has been divorced each time from our communities of interest, such as Summit and Eagle Counties, and our needs have differed vastly from the needs of other communities in the districts. It often feels like we have not been seen in the redistricting process. I&#39;d like to help make sure Lake County&#39;s voice is heard in these efforts, as well as to hear the voices of other sometimes-forgotten parts of the state. Further, as someone who is a registered and proud Democrat, I would be taking a Democratic seat on the commission. Lake County is a Democratic town, but our needs as an under-resourced rural community are different than the populous urban areas and uber-wealthy resort towns that we often think of as making up the Democratic Party in Colorado. Still, we are loyal to the Democratic Party, and I believe my community too deserves to have a seat at the table on the Democratic side as we work through the question of what effective representation will look like in Colorado for the next decade.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am an educator: what I do is try to teach students how to collaborate, assume the best in others, and think critically. These skills are what lead to consensus and create agreement. On the commission, I pledge not to exploit the weakest parts another member’s arguments to discredit the entirety of their positions. Instead, I will do what I try to teach my students: identify the strongest parts of the positions of others and use these to find consensus. For example, I am working on a committee currently at school to address issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We could take many different pathways to chart the work of this group, and we have heard from many stakeholders. In the end, I believe everyone I consulted will find aspects of their feedback and ideas in the final draft. 
Additionally, in my professional life, I am part of a talented, committed, and diverse team. I contribute to agreement by remembering I am a conductor of a choir: everything is better when we elevate all voices ensure they are heard. As we chart a path forward for my school, I need to listen for shared values. Common values often hold the key to reaching agreement. If we can agree on objectives, suddenly we find we can compromise on the ways to achieve those goals. For example, we recently were seeking to identify facilities needs for campus for the next twenty years. I had an idea to address HMI’s needs, but other people in the working group broached a different proposal. In the end, their idea achieved the same goals I shared, in a possibly more creative manner. We incorporated some of my ideas into the second solution and adopted it. 
The second part of this question is about being fair and impartial. This is also what I practice every day as a Head of School. I find I can only have one agenda: what is good for students and right for my school I am willing to hear any ideas or perspectives that address this concern. On this commission, my goal will be to best serve the people of Colorado. I will be open to any ideas that address this concern: I can never be a wedded to one approach. I am very well practiced in setting aside any personal agenda I have for the good of the mission in front of me. Serving on this commission is not about me and my wishes, it is about the citizens of this state.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
This may be my strong suit, and why this commission appeals to me. There are hundreds of possible answers to how Colorado can draw district boundaries--we will need to select one. Understanding a problem, identifying possible solutions, and evaluating the merits of each is where I thrive. It is what I do every day in my work. In education, we have a principle called Backward Design. The idea is to start with a goal and work backward to identify the steps most important to achieving that outcome—and to avoid getting distracted by interesting but inconsequential details. Backward design works wonders while planning effective classroom lessons, and I could see it helping solve many problems our commission will face as well.
As a Head of School, I must also decide how to use my time each day. I need to determine which questions are urgent and important (they need my attention and time) and which questions are unimportant and unurgent (others can address these problems). The battles that are worth fighting are the ones that will have adverse long-term consequences for the most important goals. I am good at seeing the difference between signal and noise, and will often ask others in the middle of a discussion to remind us of the problem we are trying to solve. The answer to this question will often tell us if we are discussing the right topics.
Finally, I am creative. My mind goes to work as soon as an important issue feels intractable. The Lake County School District, for example, was awarded a state BEST grant in 2019 to help construct a new PK-2 elementary school. The rules that govern the grant are complex, but new buildings cannot contain more classrooms than exist in the current one. Yet Lake County’s school-age population is booming: as our student count grew, we were faced with the prospect of moving into a new school that would be obsolete the day it opened. School leaders saw the problem as intractable, but I saw it as existential. I went before the school board and suggested appealing the issue to the state governing board; I hoped the board would show flexibility, especially if declining construction costs would mean we could add additional classrooms within the original project budget. The school district decided at the eleventh hour to appeal the original ruling, and our school district won the appeal! Our new school will open next year with sufficient classrooms to serve our community’s children.
