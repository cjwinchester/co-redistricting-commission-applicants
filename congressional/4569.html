        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Vivian Marcilena Perry</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Vivian Marcilena Perry
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Marci Perry</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently working as a self-employed personal trainer, and small business owner.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I completed my undergraduate degree in Business Administration in 2005, from the University of North Carolina - Wilmington. Since completing my undergraduate degree I obtained my personal training certification from the National Council on Strength and Fitness in 2016. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80226
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have voted in every general election since becoming eligible to vote in 2008. 

I have donated to the following organizations and campaigns
Grassroots Law
Black Lives Matter Global Network
Joe Biden Presidential Campaign 
Charles Booker Primary Senatorial Campaign
Elizabeth Warren Primary Presidential Campaign
Pete Buttigieg Primary Presidential Campaign
Bernie Sanders Primary Presidential Campaign
COPIRG
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have been active in the movement for black lives by contacting government officials, participating protests and advocating to pass SB-217, which is a bill to keep Colorado law enforcement accountable for their actions. I have also participated in grassroots lobbying by advocating for LGBTQ rights and protections at the Colorado General Assembly.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I&#39;d like to serve on the commission because I want to contribute to our nation&#39;s democracy beyond simply voting, but being an active and engaged member of society. I see sustaining fair elections as one of the most important pillars of America&#39;s founding. As I&#39;ve learned more and more about how unbalanced our political processes has become, I have been eager to find a spot in which I could become involved in its rebalancing.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that a thoughtful and open ear can not only avoid conflicts, but also solve problems. Understanding the beliefs, goals, and intent behind others&#39; words and actions can help every party to find common ground. Listening before speaking, attempting to understand before fighting, and truly believing the best in other people has been missing from our politics for far too long. In order to move forward, we must move forward together â€” not force one&#39;s own beliefs on another person.  I will strive to bring this mindset into each of my interactions, and will carry this over into my position on the redistricting commission. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In my younger years, I learned the trade of shoe shining from a family member. Shortly after moving from North Carolina to Denver, I decided to put that skill to practice by building my own business, Denver Shine Company. Figuring out how to bring a new spin to an old trade, build a client base, and budget time and money to grow a business has been one of the greatest lesson in my life. It taught me to balance competing interests, analyze the data available, and make the best decisions based on data and future goals. I will bring those lessons to my position on the redistricting committee.

At the same time that I was building Denver Shine Company, I also began my professional career as a personal trainer. Being a trainer requires me to not only analyze issues I see in my clients, but to find solutions and then effectively communicate to ensure the issues are successfully addressed. These analytic and communications skills are yet another strength I will bring to the committee.
