        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Elizabeth McCain</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Elizabeth McCain
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Betsy McCain</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a stay at home. Prior to my decision in 2015 to stay home, I was an Executive Territory Manager for Bausch + Lomb (now Bausch Health) for 5 years. I worked for Abbott Laboratories as a sales consultant from 2008-2010
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I attended the University of Colorado at Boulder, Leeds School of business with a major in Finance from 1999-2003.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80123
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have made 3 donations to WINRED since 2015. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Member of Wash Park East neighborhood association board
Advisor for a student organization at University of Denver since 2014
Vice President of St. Philips Early Learning Center school board (on the board since 2018) 
Volunteer legislative Liaison for Convention of States in 2016
Advisory council (since 2012) and now the Board of Directors for Leadership Program of the Rockies.

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a school board member I have to work to represent both the parents as well as the preschool&#39;s best interests. I have been on the board while we are navigating COVID, as well as hiring a new director for the school.
As a volunteer with Convention of states I was working to help gain support for the Convention of States resolution to help advocate for term limits because I believe the are effective for our state legislature so why not for DC officials, as well as for balancing the federal budget.
As an advisor at DU, I have to weigh the behaviors/challenges of the students I serve as well as be a voice for them with the University&#39;s administration.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I would like to be someone who represents the growing population of unaffiliated voters in this state. I don&#39;t have a dog in the R vs. D fight but rather what so many who feel underrepresented in how our boundary lines are drawn. I&#39;m tired of gerrymandering.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As someone who has worked within the professional world with much success (winning 2 top of company awards) I was able to communicate successfully with a wide spectrum of personalities of doctors and non-medical colleagues. As someone who has been selected to represent communities (preschool, DU students, Leadership Program of the Rockies) it shows me that people respect my perspectives as well as trust me to guide and make decisions that best fit the different organizations and find consensus amongst leadership groups.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a medical sales professional, I managed territories that were as large as 6 states, and as small as the south Denver Metro area. I was responsible for analyzing data for 200+ clients and devised plans for successfully achieving and in most cases exceeding quota&#39;s for the organization I represented.
