<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>

In 2016, I volunteer for Secretary Clinton&#39;s Presidential Campaign. In 2017, I served as the Campaign Manager for Ty Coleman&#39;s Mayoral campaign, of Alamosa Colorado.

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I am one of two social workers at my current employment, who started a group to tackle Systematic Racism in Child Welfare of Weld County. The task to start this group was very challenging given the political climate in 2020, around Black Lives Matter movement and the polarization of both sides. This was also extremely difficult given the conservative make up of Weld County and those in charge. Starting the group included convincing my superiors that systematic racism is an issue in our field, while maintaining resiliency due to the need to give a voice to the those disproportionally effected by the system.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Serving on this commission will allow me to use my educational background and lived experiences in Colorado, to serve my fellow residence. My degree in Political Science has taught me the importance of redistricting and how it affects the constituents politicians serve. Being from a military family, I have been fortunate to live all around the world, but specifically all throughout Colorado. I have spent significant amounts of years on the front range, in rural Alamosa, and now Weld County. These multiple residences have given me the opportunity to live among the rich diversity of humans who call Colorado home. I have been able to see how gerrymandering effects the representation, or lack thereof, for specific groups of people. Serving on this commission will allow me the opportunity to advocate for fair maps, that provide equal representation of all Coloradoans. As an African American human, I believe it is very important for the growing minority groups, to representation at the table where decisions are being made.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My current position as a Child Welfare Social Worker, requires consistent collaboration. My role often requires me to give the Department&#39;s position on custody disputes between parties. Empathy for all party prospective is crucial for this task, even if I have not experienced a custody battle in my personal life. The stakes are high in this position I hold and requires me to facilitate collaboration of all sides. Being a Child Welfare Social Worker requires me to engage with respondent parent attorneys, children attorneys and service providers. It requires me to advocate for what I believe is in the child&#39;s best interest yet understanding why each party takes the position they do. The ability to show empathy allows me to make proposals and recommendations, more likely to be agreed upon. 
The group I started to address Systematic Racism in Child Welfare, requires collaboration, empathy and group engagement to the highest level. This group requires me to engage with my coworkers who do not necessarily share my understanding of the disproportionality in our field. This work calls me to find unique ways to explain my position to my fellow group members. It requires me to present ideas in ways it is relatable, to the entire team. It is necessary for me to share understanding and be willing to compromise with my groupmates in order to reach our common goal.   
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My previous role as the PREA Coordinator of San Luis Valley Community Corrections, required analytical skills. The job required me to deconstruct information received and apply logic, critical thinking and communication, as I investigate. This role, as well as my current role in the group to address Systematic Racism in Child Welfare, requires me to collect all data and analyze what is working and what can be improved. Both of these roles required me to participate in group brainstorming as we consider the restructuring the systems. My role as the PREA Coordinator required me to audit the agency&#39;s policy to provided compliance with state law. Due to the high stakes of these positions they required consistent checking for accuracy, in order to maintain the effectiveness of the task.
