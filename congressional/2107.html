        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Jeffrey G Crank</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Jeffrey G Crank
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Jeff Crank</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Regional Director, Americans for Prosperity
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Bachelor of Arts in Political Science
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80908
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
While on HOA board, I opposed a fee increase for internet upgrade but when it passed by neighbors, I led the effort to implement the new fee and served as Treasurer and point person.  As Regional Director at Americans for Prosperity, worked with the ACLU to pass a campus free speech bill and criminal justice legislation in several western states.  During the 2000 redistricting fight, when plans - some put forward by Republicans - split El Paso county, I filed a motion to intervene as I believed that it was inappropriate to split a county for political purposes especially given that there are five military installations in El Paso county.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I ran for Congress in 2006 and 2008 but have not been active in the Republican party since then except voting.  I have given a few hundred dollars to friends running for political office since that time.  I was president of Aegis Strategic, LLC from 2013-2017 which was a political consulting firm and had several clients across the country but in general, I did not work directly with the candidates but oversaw business operations.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Forest Gate Home Owners association, 2017-2019; Pikes Peak Firearms Coalition, 2004-present; Regional Director, Americans for Prosperity, 2013-present.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
This is a unique opportunity to end the gerrymandering process that political parties have engage in and move us to a system that is designed for greater representation of citizens.  Colorado has an opportunity to lead the nation in redistricting with this new process but only if we can have citizens who are interested in drawing lines that benefit communities of interest rather than political advantage.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have always been someone who tries to evaluate plans, ideas or proposals based on how they match up to my guiding principle.  Here, my guiding principle would be to evaluate plans based on how they best represent communities and I would stick to that focus.  In addition, I have consistently shown throughout my career that I work with those on the other side of the aisle to form a consensus.  As an example, while working as a Republican staff member in Congress, I worked with the Clinton administration to write the Military Family Housing Privatization Act which became law.  I also worked with Nancy Pelosi to stop Most Favored Nation trade status for China and also with former Congresswoman Pat Schroeder and her Chief of Staff Kip Cheroutis on numerous military installation issues including the closure of Fitzsimmons Army Hospital and the attempted closure of Fort Carson.  These examples demonstrate my ability to work with those that I may disagree with politically for the greater good.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Applying analytical skills is one of my strengths.  Whether it is my self-taught skills of auto repair, ammunition reloading, home repairs, furniture making or work related budget issues, I enjoy analyzing problems and then working my way slowly through the obstacles or challenges that come up so that I can get to a final solution that is viable.  I&#39;ve used these skills in getting bipartisan legislation passed in Congress and in state legislatures in the past.  To me, analysis and problem solving is essential in finding a workable solution and one which can build consensus.  The goal is to get a balanced outcome which all parties can live with and nobody feels like they were run over in the process.
