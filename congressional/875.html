<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I retired in May 2020 as a Distinguished Professor of Public Administration in the School of Public Affairs at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs. I am a Fellow (2007) of the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), past President (2008-2009) of the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA), and recipient (2017) of the Doctor Honoris Causa from IAPAS (Mexico). I am the author or co-author of 16 books including Public Personnel Management (7th edition 2017, also published in Spanish and Chinese), over 200 other publications and over 150 conference presentations. I was a Distinguished Professor in Residence at the US Department of Health &amp; Human Services (1991), Fulbright Senior Scholar (Central America 1994), visiting professor at UNAM, Mexico (1999-2003), and consultant to the United Nations, the World Bank and the Interamerican Development Bank on public management capacity building. I was on the faculty of IUPUI (1974-1980), Florida International University (1980-2001), and UCCS (2001-2020). Prior to earning a Ph.D. in Public Administration from the University of Southern California in 1974, I worked for the USCSC (now US Office of Personnel Management) from 1968-1973 as a management intern and staffing specialist. As Editor-at-Large for Public Integrity, I am writing and editing a 3-year (2019-2022) bimonthly editorial series on “The State of the Republic.”

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I am a lifelong boundary-crosser who has built effective networks of public servants and administrators throughout the world. Two recent examples show how I have done this:
•	In June 2019, I hosted a group of visiting Mexican scholars at the UCCS School of Public Affairs as part of their one-year postdoctoral study at 4 graduate institutions, 3 of them Mexican. This included developing the academic program and related cultural events, gaining UCCS approval, working with the Colorado Springs World Affairs Council and the Colorado Springs City Council, arranging transportation, lodging and two banquets; and hosting a “thank you” dinner at my home for all those who helped make the visit a success.
•	In March 2015, UCCS sponsored an international conference on building better relations with Mexico. I developed this conference together with Steve Recca, Director of the SPA-UCCS Center for Human Security. Co-sponsors included Governor Hickenlooper, the State Director of Economic Development, the Mexican Consulate (Denver), and U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM). It included experts from Mexico and the US, including UCCS.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The cynicism and apathy that corrode U.S. democracy today are responses to gerrymandering, vote suppression, and institutional deviations from “one person, one vote.” Independent commissions are more likely to draw districts that are compact, respect existing political boundaries, and preserve district continuity (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/03/17/this-will-get-rid-of-gerrymandered-districts/). I want to help Colorado’s independent commission process become a successful model for our nation.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The most important job of public universities is to serve as an arena for civic engagement. For 46 years, my introductory graduate course in public service and public affairs began by teaching and modeling the “rules of civic engagement.” In a culture heavily influenced by rant-radio talk show hosts and ideologically charged political sound bites, people typically get little training on how to discuss policy issues on which they disagree deeply. This makes democracy less functional.

Groups are more effective when they follow the rules of civic engagement, which are:
•	No matter how much you disagree with someone, be more concerned with learning what they believe and why than with explaining or defending your own viewpoint.
•	No matter how illogical or uninformed they seem to be, do not shout them down, call them names, or tune them out by stereotyping them in your own mind.
•	If you have trouble with these two rules, repeat this mantra silently as you listen: “Is it possible that under any circumstances, some part of what they say might conceivably be true?” Repeat until they finish and ask you what you think.
•	If this mantra gives you trouble, do it while breathing through your nose, not your mouth.

After a few weeks of modeling, students unconsciously begin to use these rules themselves. The class transforms itself from a theater for eloquent bullies into an arena for civic engagement by a group of reflective, intelligent adults. Shouting, name-calling, and derogatory asides die out. Speakers get better at stating their views succinctly and supporting them effectively with expert opinions, personal experiences, data, and logic. Classmates turn toward the speaker, listen more closely, and interrupt less. They address questions and comments to each other by name. Little by little, as the dominant ones listen more and talk less, the quieter ones creep into the newly cleared conversational space. Soon, no one misses class except for work or family emergencies. This is how we learn together.

The principles of civic engagement transform lives and strengthen democracy. If selected for the Commission, these are the principles I pledge to follow.
