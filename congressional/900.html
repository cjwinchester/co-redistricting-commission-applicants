        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for David Allen Averill</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  David Allen Averill
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Executive Director, San Miguel Authority for Regional Transportation
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a BA from the University of Nebraska - Lincoln in Environmental Studies with minors in Sociology and English. I also have a Masters degree in Urban and Regional Planning with significant studies in Transportation Systems Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81435
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I think my record with CASTA is probably most relevant, aside from my full time work. As president of the Board of Directors of CASTA, I helped maintain a balanced viewpoint that represented interests from all across the State. From large transit agencies such as RTD in Denver, to very small rural agencies such as the Dolores County Senior Transportation Program, I worked to make sure that all voices and viewpoints were heard and represented. I think the fact that I have been elected to the CASTA Board for two terms now illustrates that my peers and colleagues from around the state (those who elect members of the Board) trust my intent, judgement, and ability to lead.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have never ran for any public office, volunteered for any campaign, or donated to any political campaign.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
1. All Points Transit (operating out of Montrose) Board of Directors. This is a local non-profit. I am still serving on this Board as board secretary.
2. Colorado Association of Transit Agency&#39;s Board of Directors. This is a professional organization who&#39;s membership consists of transit providers all across Colorado. I am the immediate past president of the Board of Directors and am still serving on this Board.
3. Northstar Condo&#39;s HOA. Until recently I was a Board officer on my residential HOA Board. First as secretary, then as president. I resigned from the HOA Board in early October of 2020.
4. San Miguel County Open Space Committee. I am no longer a member of this local advisory committee.
5. South West Transit Association - Board of Directors. I served as a representative from CASTA on this Board. I am no longer on this board.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As an Unaffiliated voter in Colorado, I have found limited opportunities to be involved in politics beyond simply voting. I believe that the redistricting commission has an amazing opportunity to ensure that Colorado&#39;s congressional districts serve as an honest reflection of those who live in them, without the partisan gerrymandering we&#39;ve seen over so many years. I would be extremely honored to be entrusted with a role on the re-districting Commission and believe its work will have a lasting impact on the State - for the better.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As an independent voter, I see the pluses (and negatives) of both sides of our traditional political &quot;aisle&quot;. As an executive leader with a proven track record working in the public sector with and on behalf of varied communities, I am always striving for consensus and agreement in difficult conversations. This can only be done by being fair and impartial - even in difficult or stressful conversations. I have found (for better or worse - and not always to my pleasure) that I am a natural leader when it comes to pulling groups together to develop mutually beneficial solutions. This has been confirmed by some work over the years with professional coaches and assessments such as Hogan Lead and Hogan Challenge - I&#39;d be happy to share the results of those assessments if anyone wanted to see them. How do I do it? I&#39;m just myself - no bull. I&#39;m also a pretty nice guy who people respect and want to work with - even if they need to give a little. I am always looking for the win-win and my track records supports this.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As an urban planner with a background in systems engineering, I am a data driven decision maker. That&#39;s not to say that I&#39;m blind to community values and motivations, or that I&#39;m not politically savvy - because I am. As the Executive Director of one of Colorado&#39;s six regional transportation authorities, all of my decisions and recommendations are transparent, based in logic, and made with the best interests of the communities I serve in mind. I think this mindset and skillset will serve me well if I am fortunate enough to be appointed to this Commission.
