<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have worked for conservation organizations for much of my professional life, including my current role as the executive director of Colorado Communities for Climate Action, a coalition of 34 counties and municipalities across the state focused on strengthening statewide climate policy. I served on the Golden Historic Preservation Board prior to serving on the Golden City Council and then serving as Golden&#39;s mayor. I also served on the board of the Denver Regional Council of Governments and the executive committee of the Metro Mayors Caucus. I regularly participate in informal community efforts to tackle particular problems or help individuals in need.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Fair, independently derived district maps are foundational to a healthy democracy.

I bring a unique perspective, having worked across all levels of government and with both a long history of community activism in the service of specific causes and as an elected public servant, with an obligation to treat every community member fairly and to fairly balance among competing interests.

I understand how critical fairly drawn non-partisan and non-gerrymandered districts are to a vibrant and representative electoral process, and how vital a strong electoral process is for government&#39;s ability to earn and maintain the public trust and serve the public interest. My career, personal interests, and political work over the years have regularly intersected with these fundamental issues of fair elections and good governance: a graduate degree in Political Science from the University of Colorado, twenty-five years of conservation advocacy at the state and federal levels, my time in the U.S. Senate as a policy advisor on energy and climate, seven years in elected office at the local level, and work in urban development and civic engagement while in office and while employed by a nonprofit specializing in that work. 

Finally, as a long-time supporter of independent redistricting commissions, and a supporter of Colorado&#39;s two redistricting initiatives in 2018, it would be a privilege to participate in this process.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My roles have regularly involved contributing to or leading decision processes where every participant felt valued and heard and the conclusions had consensus support of the group. This was frequently the case in formal leadership settings, such as chairing a Metro Vision subcommittee at the Denver Regional Council of Governments and while serving as mayor. This has also regularly been the case even in more advocacy-oriented roles, sometimes negotiating mutually beneficial outcomes between the parties and frequently negotiating internally among diverse allies and partners. In my current role as the executive director of a local government coalition that structurally depends on reaching consensus, my job is often most fundamentally to lead the 34 separate jurisdictions to consensus decisions on policy positions, advocacy priorities, resource allocation, and organizational management and vision.

When serving in roles where impartiality is desired or required, I am very comfortable approaching the work in that way. This was certainly true while serving in elected office for the many land use and other quasi-judicial decisions where impartiality was required, just as it has been in every instance that I wore an impartial convenor/mediator/facilitator hat instead of an advocacy hat.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
A substantial proportion of my professional and local government work during the past decades has involved precisely these skills. The policy work requires a thoughtful analysis of the policy issues, a careful assessment of the trade-offs among different approaches, and effective communication skills. Running nonprofits and serving in elected office both require careful attention to budgets, strategic plans, and problem solving. Virtually all of the community work I&#39;ve participated in has depended on some degree of collaborating, creative brainstorming and innovating, and prioritizing.
