</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I am an active member of several conservation/environmental organizations. I have organized grassroots campaigns around safe drinking water, healthy watersheds, and social justice. I organized a campaign in Colorado to ban toxic fire-fighting foam (AFFF) from entering our waterways. I am an advocate for underrepresented communities, in particular the Asian-American community. As the daughter of immigrants, I am an advocate and have campaigned for underrepresented individuals to have a voice in policy-making and in spaces where decisions are being made. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Door knocking and phone calling for: President Obama (2015); Donated to the campaigns of Elizabeth Warren (2020), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (2020), Diane Mitsch-Bush (2020).
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Colorado Parent Teacher Association(Vice President local school group); Trout Unlimited (member/volunteer); National Resource Defense Council (member); Fountain Creek Water Sentinels (Board Member/Chair); Colorado Sierra Club (Board Member/Chair); Pikes Peak Trout Unlimited (member/volunteer); Colorado River Watch (volunteer); Pikes Peak Women Angler&#39;s (member); Great Old Broads for the Wilderness (member/volunteer); LifeQuestTransitions (co-founder/board member); Northridge Pacer Track Club (board member); International Music Syndicate (board member).
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I represent a somewhat unique segment of the population in Colorado. As a first-generation American, I am aware of the privilege of voting and how important a fair and just process is to ensure that the principles of democracy are upheld. I see service on the commission as part of my civic duty.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Starting as a Girl Scout member in kindergarten, I was taught that being a citizen required participation and vigilance. In my lifetime, I have served on several executive boards in various capacities. As part of my executive board member duties, I have been entrusted to execute and carry out, in good faith, the mission of an organization. I have been elected by my peers to positions of authority and most recently served as Chair of the Colorado Sierra Club. I am fair and impartial with regards to the carrying out of by-laws and seeing that compliance issues are adhered to. While I am an advocate, I am also able to see all sides of an issue and have often mediated difficult conversations and situations. As a board member and volunteer for several organizations, I have worked with people from all different backgrounds who have different priorities.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I worked for a Family Law attorney for many years. I learned to write motions and create arguments that would hold up in court. Despite my environmental and conservationist leanings, I work towards just and fair solutions to issues. As a software developer, I often see the linear answer to a problem, but as a human I understand that there are explicit and implicit biases that require awareness and attention. As a community organizer, I have had to approach issues with a clear intention and strategy from beginning to end. Often, flexibility has been necessary as situations evolve and being able to adapt and analyze new information is crucial. I have been able to break down complex issues (i.e. the fire fighting foam (AFFF contamination issue)) to levels of understanding that ordinary people can comprehend. This actually takes skill and a deep understanding of how to get from point A to point B in a logical and concise manner.
