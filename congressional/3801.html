<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Bobbie Daniel was born into a sixth-generation Colorado pioneer family and grew up in the small agricultural community of Palisade, Colorado. 

From an early age, Bobbie was involved in helping those around her. When she was only ten, she worked with her mother at the Pregnancy Center and helped out at her Step mother’s salon doing laundry and cleaning brushes. She served as a lifeguard as a teenager and taught swimming lessons to young children. In high school, Bobbie held a number of leadership positions, from Student Council to co-captain of her swim team and club volleyball teams. 

Bobbie&#39;s freshman year at Mesa State College she worked her way to the National Dean&#39;s List while scooping ice cream at Baskin Robins and waiting tables. As a freshman in college, Bobbie was accepted into AmeriCorps and spent a year serving her community and country. She served in programs ranging from a Habitat for Humanity Blitz Build (20 homes in one week) in Lubbock, Texas, to an outreach program for educating children in one of the most poverty-stricken areas of Denver about health and safety. In addition, Bobbie and her teammates renovated a 200,000 sq ft. warehouse in Colorado Springs to be used as a Youth Outreach Center and built an outdoor classroom for public schools in Elk City, Oklahoma.

 “I was the lucky one to serve in such a giving way to others for a year out of my young life. I knew my purpose and it was meaningful, it mattered to someone, and it made a difference. I loved every minute of helping others and by doing so, it changed me.”
 Bobbie eventually felt called to start her own business with a family trade and she opened a salon in her early twenties. She was sought after by Coloradans for her professional skills — but also for her listening skills and her natural ability to care for them. Bobbie built a reputation as a good listener, a problem solver, and someone who could be trusted. 

After more than a decade of listening to hundreds of clients she found common threads and concerns, why did so many people in one way or another feel like they had less and less control over their own lives? Why had so many problems not been fixed, year after year, election after election?

 As she heard the voices of Coloradans from every walk of life, she was moved to seek solutions for the most vulnerable among us. She sat down at her kitchen table to write her book, “Solutions From a Nobody”.  

That was only the beginning of the journey, she took the values she was raised with, the founding principles that she has learned, and the faith that grounds her to work within her community to advocate for solutions within spheres of public policy at the local, state and even national level. 

“My journey has led me to the core foundations of faith, family, and founding principles which sadly have become hidden truths that nobody wants to talk about, in a world that is desperately hungry for it.”  
2019-2020 Communications Director Joni Inman Jefferson County Commissioner D2

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I love Colorado and our Congressional Maps to be fair and balanced for the people of our great state. It would be an honor to serve my state in such a meaningful way. Thank you for your consideration. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Listening is one of my strengths and I believe finding common ground is a pillar to solving any problem. Defining goals with measurable benchmarks helps the team stay on track for success. I&#39;m just a mom who loves this state. I grew up in Western Colorado and also built a business in the heart of Cherry Creek in Denver for over a decade. We are now raising our family in Grand Junction Colorado. I feel very fortunate to have lived on both sides of the state, rural, and city life experience under my belt. My family has been in Colorado since before statehood, which gives me insight and brings a well-round point of view. Ultimately I know we can all work together for the good of Colorado and her people. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Logic and reason are the foundation of civil society which I use as a guidepost to understanding others, searching and listening for their side, their experience, and together coming up with a way forward. Solutions that you can hang your hat on even when others may not agree with you when they see your reason and logic behind a decision that was made it goes a long way.
