<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I believe that my training as an attorney has guided my in advocacy for various community interests with which I get involved, whether officially or informally, including litigation experience. Additionally, throughout my adult life, I have worked on many fundraising events for schools, fire departments, and local organizations. Most recently, I served as co-chair for the YWCA Boulder County 2020 Gala. I have visited lawmakers many times to present concerns of my own as well as my community. I was asked to be the first chair of the Advocacy Committee for the YWCA Board of Directors when it was established in 2017, I remained on the committee through the rest of my tenure, and when requested to stay on the committee post board membership, I agreed.

I have also participated in and organized voter registration drives, phone banks for candidates and issues, letter writing campaigns, post card campaigns and calling representatives about particular issues of import. I have also managed these activities once organized.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My political and advocacy work has focused on inclusion, and joining the redistricting committee is a culminating event of those prior activities. I believe my contribution as a committee member will facilitate the committee drawing redistricting maps for Colorado that will be the consummate model of inclusion, rather than suppression, for all other states to emulate.
Furthermore, dedicating myself to the work of redistricting seems the ideal means of honoring the centennial of women suffragistsâ€™ success and the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, both of which met necessary goals of equality and justice as outlined in our Constitution and Amendments. In order to save and preserve the republic formed thereby, we must protect voting rights through fair districting that is inclusive and representative for all regardless of race, religions, sexuality, gender, and economic status.
As a member of the redistricting committee, I wish to enable Colorado to live up to ideals enshrined in our Constitution.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Servant leadership involves a leadership style promoting community needs above your own, including members of your team/committee. Acknowledging perspectives of the team, involving them in decisions, and supporting them where needed specifies how I choose to work with committees. The application of these ideals, I believe, leads to innovation, trust and higher engagement. 
For instance, with redistricting, the root is to ensure fair representation for all Coloradans, but the main issue may be geographic distribution of population. Listening to all Coloradans from the Western Slope to the Foothills, to Ski Country, to Farm and Ranch country is necessary. Distilling those voices into a resolution will involve really hearing the input and managing the information so all know they were heard even if not all ideas are integrated. Explaining the underlying goals and methods to achieve them should allow those who were heard, but not incorporated, to feel confident in the outcome because they were part of the process.
Promoting consensus begins with finding a uniform goal, which is outlined in the legislation that created the redistricting committee process. Building from there, the committees can find processes suitable to all for the collection of information, coordination of the information gathered, and analyzing what is collected. Everyone has an equal voice and must be afforded respect while presenting their positions, this is where listening skills are highly regarded. When we hold the goal as the purpose for the group, not any one memberâ€™s personal desired outcome, success shall be achieved.
As my listening skills have improved, I have found that my persuasive skills have also improved. People want to be heard. When you truly listen, they know. You learn from them because you have listened and heard, and so you acknowledge what you have learned and how that information fits into the processes previously outlined. Buy in by members is what leads to consensus.  Assent is possible when members can trust you to have listened, heard, and acknowledged them. This occurs when the processes permit, even promote, sound discussions in which all members participate fully and are heard equally and equitably.
I believe that my skills described above, especially listening, and adherence to the goal of fair, inclusive, and competent redistricting is why I shall remain fair and impartial.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Research is the basis upon which critical thinking and analytical skills can produce positive results, and I possess critical research skills and excellent reading, writing and listening skills, which support analytical thinking. Often, identifying the problem is challenging, and this is where listening skills are invaluable. There may be multiple perspectives of a problem, including that there is no problem. Once a problem is identified, gathering information about the source of the problem leads to creative solutions as the root cause is addressed rather than merely a symptom. Next, one must put the solutions into writing in a clear, concise format easily understood by the audience for whom it is intended. Such writing skills will persuade committee members and communities at large of the benefits of the solution and create consensus for the solution.
I am confident my skills in analysis, listening, writing, persuasion, problem solving and being generally respectful of others will greatly benefit the committee if I am selected.
