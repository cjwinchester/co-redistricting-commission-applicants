<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I am a visual communicator who speaks some Spanish, and has excellent interpersonal skills. I enjoy working on projects that make a difference. I understand the importance of doing a job thoroughly, professionally and in this case impartially as the ramifications will be with us as Coloradans for years to come. 
I have advocated for nonprofit groups my entire life. I get results, as proven when assigned to difficult sections to enumerate for the 3rd and final wave of Teller County in Census 2010. 
I had been the Recruiting Manager for Census 2000 in the Hollywood/MidWilshire Census District that had 26 distinct linguistic populations. My background in the film industry makes me an ideal candidate, as I am experienced at covering all sorts of terrain and solving many logistics that one encounters on location.  I am a confident, educated individual who has a friendly approach and can establish rapport with anyone from all walks of life.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I understand thoroughly the importance of this job to redefine the Congressional and Legislative Districts of the State of Colorado, from my prior work with the US Census Bureau over the years. Public Service lights me up, and this has been a family tradition that my grandfather trained me for with his endless questioning. &quot;What good deed have you done today?&quot; Working for the greater good is my lifelong passion in my own small, humble way. Therefore in a job like this, I am prepared to go above and beyond in every way I possibly can, in order to create the best result possible for the People of Colorado. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Creating consensus is a key skill when working on any project, especially in Government. I have advocated for the citizens of Manitou Springs by attending numerous City Council meetings as a private citizen. This gave me the opportunity to make statements to our City Councilors in a respectful and concise way as Government officials have a very limited time to be briefed on the circumstances, review the information before making a decision. Further I am not intimidated by their status as a professional, an attorney, or whatever background they may come from, as I have worked with people from all walks of life including many celebrities. I am not swayed by anyone&#39;s position or power they yield, and I have excellent manners. I promote a win/win scenario in any transaction if possible, and will always keep in mind whom I would truly be serving, namely the people of Colorado in all its wonderful diversity. 
Therefore it is important that any personal political bias be left at home, no matter how passionate I might be about any party. We must work together as the American people. Being fair and impartial is a must in this type of work. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have an unusual background, being a Creative with a degree in Physics. I have had a lifelong interest in metaphysics and the global study of consciousness. I have a highly logical and creative mindset, and I am great at math. Being a practical, down-to-earth woman who grew up farming, I know that there is a solution to every problem. It is just a matter of being persistent, and having the right resources to get through any challenge that we may be confronted with. I completely cultivate an attitude of positivity, as that is my personal commitment.
