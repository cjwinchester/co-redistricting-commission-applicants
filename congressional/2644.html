        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Antonio Ruiz</h3>

<div class='applicant-detail'>

  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

  Retired from University of Colorado Hospital, Aurora, CO; January 2014
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  1966 - Registered Radiologic Technologist, St. Vincent Hospital/University of Toledo, Ohio;  1976 - Bachelor of Business Administration, University of Toledo, Ohio;  1979 - Master of Business Administration, University of Toledo, Ohio;  2008 - Fellow, American College of Healthcare Executives 
</p>

  80220
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been a registered unaffiliated voter for many years.  I chose this voter classification because it is more important for me to vote for the candidate I determine is best qualified to fill a particular position than to be &quot;expected&quot; to vote for an individual because he/she and I are in the same political party.  Therefore, I have voted the Democratic Party since November 10, 2015.  I supported Hillary Clinton and Senator Timothy Kaine in 2016.  I initially supported and donated to Mayor Pete Buttigieg in his Presidential campaign.  Since his withdrawal from the Presidential race, I have supported and donated to the DNC, Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Kamala Harris, Mark Kelly, Jamie Harrison and John Hickenlooper.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Since my retirement in January 2014, I have not been involved in any political or civic organizations.  However, I did serve as President of the Board of the Homeowners&#39; Association where I reside from August 2014 through December 2017.  I continue to provide mentoring support to this Board.  I have been volunteering at Twin Parishes Food Bank in Denver for almost three years and for Christ the King Catholic Church in Denver for two years.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Since returning to Denver in 1983 I have had the privilege of working at Saint Joseph Hospital for eleven years and the University of Colorado Hospital for nineteen years.  I held the positions of Director of Diagnostic Imaging and Vice President of Clinical and Support Services at Saint Joseph Hospital.  While employed by the University of Colorado Hospital I held the positions of Vice President of Operations and Project Executive.  During my combined tenure at these two prestigious healthcare institutions (1983-2014) I was given the opportunity to serve on the following Boards:  Bonfils Blood Center (Board member and Board Chair); Colorado Boulevard Health Care District Association (Board member); AlloSource Denver (Board member); Donor Alliance (Board member and Board Chair); Rocky Mountain Stroke Chapter (Board member); Colorado Cancer Research Program (Board member and Board Chair); City of Denver Task Force to Develop a Hospital Expansion Ordinance (Task Force member); Uptown on the Hill Association (Board member and Board Secretary), Green Valley Ranch Optimist Club (Board member); Greenlee Metro Elementary School (City of Denver Collaborative Decision Making Team member); Marrama Elementary School PTA (Board member and Board President).
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I, like many other voters, have for many years complained about Colorado&#39;s redistricting process. Therefore, I was very excited when Colorado voters chose in 2018 to modernize this out-of-date process.  I see this as a long desired personal opportunity to combine my group leadership, listening and participation skills with the skills of other Commission members to successfully achieve the Commission&#39;s goals.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Promoting consensus and being fair are trademarks of my success while serving on a number of professional and varied association Boards.  The same can be said for my leadership when overseeing the many construction projects totaling $1.5 billion during my tenure at the University of Colorado Hospital.  Several of the key attributes that contribute to my success are the fact that I spend more time listening than speaking and ensuring all participants involved in a meeting or discussion are given the opportunity to present their ideas and opinion(s).  I have also been recognized for my ability to &quot;encourage&quot; individuals to focus on the topic being discussed and to &quot;keep things moving&quot; without rushing the participants.  As with football or baseball team, I believe all members of a committee should ideally feel like a winner after a final decision has been made.  I also believe the chances for achieving this ideal position is increased when all members understand and agree with the Committee&#39;s goals and the members are reminded of their agreement with the goals when necessary.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
During my almost 50 years working in a hospital setting I have been confronted with many problems ranging from minor to critical patient related problems or architectural design related problems found while constructing a new academic medical center.  My first instinct was to speak with the affected patient or the individual who identified the problem.  This continues to be one of my initial responses to problems.  However, I have learned the importance of also immediately bringing in other knowledgeable individuals to discuss the cause of the problem and options to resolve it.  I also use historical data on the same or similar problems, if available, that may include cause, probable resolution options and the effect of the chosen resolution.   My desire is that we do not need to &quot;re-invent the wheel&quot; unless this is the only viable option available to us.  However, this re-invention needs to be done in a rational and intelligent manner that leads to successfully achieving the Commission&#39;s goals.
