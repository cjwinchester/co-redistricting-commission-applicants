<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I donated a nominal amount ($100) to Representative Matt Soper during his intial run for the Colorado House of Represetnatives;
Each of the past five years I have donated $500 to the Action Committee for Rural Electrification (ACRE) and its affiliate, Colorado Advocates for Rural Electrification (CARE). ACRE and CARE are non-partisan political action committees to support and promote the interests of rural electric cooperatives.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Grand Junction Economic Partnership (GJEP), Board Member, Treasurer; 
Grand Junction Chamber of Commerce Legislative Committee;
Colorado Rural Electric Association (CREA), Board Member;
CREA Managers Association, President;

CMU Industrial Advisory Committee
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I am an active participant on the Grand Junction Chamber of Commerce Legislative Committee, and regularly take part in legislative video conferences with local legislators when the Assembly is in session.
I take part in legislative advocacy functions sponsored by the Colorado Rural Electric Association (CREA), the statewide trade organization representing the interests of rural electric cooperatives. I regularly attend two legislative conferences in Denver each year sponsored by CREA, meeting face-to-face with Colorado legislators. 
In 2015, then-Congressman Jared Polis invited me to Washington, DC to speak to the Congressional Innovation in Alternative Energies Working Group about the first-of-its kind low income community solar project I developed at Grand Valley Power.
I am a regular attendee at legislative rallies in Washington, DC sponsored by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) each spring. On several occasions I have led the Colorado delegation in addressing legislators and staffers during these functions. At one of these rallies, I made one of the earliest pitches for moving the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) headquarters from Washington, DC to Grand Junction. I also met with representatives of the BLM advocating for the move. 
Several years ago, I was also able to take advantage of another opportunity to meet legislators and policy makers at the Colorado Capital Conference in Washington, DC, sponsored by the University of Colorado and Colorado Mesa University.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The ideals of our representative democracy can only be realized if our citizens are fairly represented in our legislatures. Shifting demographics present challenges for rural parts of Colorado. These challenges are magnified by increasing political polarization, deepening the rural-urban divide. The redistricting commissions provide an opportunity for the citizenry to address inequities and imbalances and promote needed healing in our statewide political environment. My education (a bachelorâ€™s degree in Government and Political Science and a law degree) and experience (15 years as a trial and business attorney and 20 years as a utility executive) have prepared me for this important work. I understand the political process. I have analytical and advocacy skills. In my work leading organizations and interacting with various governing boards, I have demonstrated the ability to use my skills and training to build consensus. I want to use these skills to help our state get the most out of this redistricting effort. I feel an obligation to the people and communities of the Western Slope and other rural parts of the state to ensure that we are effectively represented during this critical process.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have succeeded as a consensus builder by following several basic steps. First, it is necessary to establish ground rules ensuring that all participants in the process will have a full opportunity to contribute. Early on, participants should focus their efforts on identifying and understanding the objective or goal that we are trying to achieve. When the goal is clear, it is helpful to look at a wide spectrum of alternatives that will advance us toward the goal. Preliminary analysis will help refine and narrow the focus on a handful of potential resolutions. As the group drills deeper, the objectivity and accuracy of the analysis takes on added importance. Group members should challenge the analysis and should respectfully challenge each other. In my experience, it is much easier to advocate for a position that is supported by objective analysis, and I often find myself  doing so. Trade-offs and compromises are often necessary, but as they are negotiated, the ultimate goal or objective of the exercise should always be kept in mind. 
A goal-oriented, fact-based process promotes fairness and impartiality. When these ideals are threatened, I try to steer the group back to the goal, and back to the facts. 
One of the challenges I face at the helm of a cash-strapped small utility is compensating a highly skilled work force in a manner that is fair to both the employees and the rate-payers that bear the burden of this expense. Using the process outlined above, I have built consensus in connection with union negotiations that achieved this delicate balance.
As a utility executive, I am charged to develop and apply programs, policies and rates that are fair and nondiscriminatory. Nondiscriminatory rate making requires intensive analysis of the cost to serve our rate-paying member base. This kind of intensive analysis can lead to a lack of innovation, as incumbents tend to rely on systems that have been in place for years, for fear that new approaches would lead to regulatory challenges based on discrimination. I have led innovative changes that benefit vulnerable rate-payers, while still maintaining fair and nondiscriminatory rates. These programs include (1) the nationâ€™s first community solar facility dedicated to serving low-income consumers â€“ a model that was adopted by the Colorado Energy Office and at least ten other utilities; and (2) Grand Valley Powerâ€™s Hometown Relief Fund, providing bill payment assistance to consumers facing adverse financial impacts due to COVID-19.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My legal training and experience have taught me to identify and analyze issues honestly and objectively. I try to approach problems from several different angles, as the best solution is not always the most obvious one. I recognize that it can be helpful to employ a team approach, as team members may have a perspective that allows them to identify obstacles or solutions that would otherwise go undetected. The simple process of considering alternative solutions, and identifying the pros and cons associated with them can narrow the universe of acceptable solutions.
