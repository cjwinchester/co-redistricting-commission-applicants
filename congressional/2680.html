        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Kevin Williams</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Kevin Williams
</p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Senior SBA Loan Officer
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I graduated from High School at Ralston Valley High School in Arvada Colorado and attended Seattle Pacific University. I double majored in Theology and Education Ministry with a minor in Psychology. In the years since, I have gained skills and experience through great opportunities at work. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80439
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
While I have voted historically and followed politics closely, I have not donated to any campaigns. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I was a member of Faith Lutheran Church in Castle Rock Colorado, while serving as the associate pastor, from July 2015 - August 2019. In the past year I have started serving as a panelist at various non-profits and community organization as a resource for small businesses. These meetings have occurred at various areas around the state ranging from Sterling Colorado to Grand Junction. These invitations come through various community groups, SBDC&#39;s, startup incubators, and public health organizations. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
During my years as an Associate Pastor, one of my primary roles was to connect and engage our suburban congregation in ways that we could benefit our broader community. The church was based in Castle Rock and as a result a majority of the partnerships I developed and cultivated were in Denver. One of my joys during this time was pushing people to engage with others that they might not normally encounter during their day to day routines. These connections ranged from homeless shelters, immigration advocacy groups, substance abuse centers, human trafficking organizations and many other points of connection. My hope within this was to allow our congregation to serve, but also that they would know their context and community. Driving 25 minutes from Castle Rock to Aurora brings a dramatic change in context that often brought broader perspective for the needs of our community. 

Since I began my role at DreamSpring I have been advocating for the small business community across Colorado. This has been done through partnerships in Denver and across rural parts of the state. I was asked to coordinate DreamSprings response to the CARES Act across the 16 states that we serve but I also feel that this gave me a unique perspective into the ways our community felt the economic impact of the Covid-19 outbreak. Resort communities were often the first spaces impacted but soon thereafter various other industries began feeling the impact of the virus outbreak. This demonstrated clearly that while we are a diverse state, in both our economies, towns and people, we are also connected as a community and bound together. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on this commission because I believe if given the opportunity to be a member I could make positive contributions. I love our state and its communities. I would be honored to work on behalf of our people. 

I am an excellent listener and communicator. I genuinely care about people of all backgrounds and beliefs. I have years of experience in finding and building commonality. I have an intuitive understanding of systems. I recognize problems and system issues before they arrive. I understand tension, nuance, and balance. 

If there are better more qualified people, I will happily let them serve on the commission. However, I truly believe I should am the type of person who should be strongly considered. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have extensive experience in communicating communal value and developing communal identities. Who are we, why are we here, what to we hope to accomplish. Within a group of people that will likely have differing opinions holding onto those values and respelling one another for the ways we are different will be essential. 

One of my skills is asking effective clarifying questions that help others to express themselves more fully. In doing so you can often help some feel validated and heard while also drawing out the implications of their perspective. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Analytical skills and logical thinking are two of my greatest strengths. If I am being considered for this commission I am happy to have a conversation about this further. 

An example : At work on of my current projects develop underwriting criteria for my origination that balanced organizational risk, loan production, client risk, and meeting client need. My goal is to hold all of these in tension and develop criteria that weigh them correctly. From there, the more complicated piece is communicating those criteria to our lending teams and underwriting teams, along with the &#39;why&#39; behind the established guidelines. 

A Second Example : I designed DreamSprings Paycheck Protection Program. Settling aside humility, this program is one of my greatest professional accomplishments. We are a small non-profit but we managed to be one of the top PPP lenders in many of our states. We are a nonprofit business lender, typically lending $9-$10 million dollars annually. From April through July, we distributed $69 million dollars in PPP funds (mostly to underserved populations) in a three month timeline. In September, our organization had received quotes to outsource the forgiveness process by contracting a third party. Bids for outsourcing were between $300,000 - $350,000. In an effort to keep this process in house, in a 7 day span I build a forgiveness platform that automates a majority of the steps pre-fills clients data based on unique identifiers. The logic included in the web based application is better than what&#39;s being offered by nationwide banks. Clients typically take 3-7 minutes to complete their forgiveness application and our team only allocates three hours of staff time per week on system upkeep.
