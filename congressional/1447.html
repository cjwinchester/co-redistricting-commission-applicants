</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My country and this state have provided us with much.  I&#39;d like to give back and help determine Colorado&#39;s state and federal electoral boundaries as fairly as possible, independent from the party politics that often have influenced past determinations.  I have a deep and sincere  interest in seeing our electoral district boundaries are not slanted to benefit either one of the two major political parties and believe my mathematics and legal education, experience in working and representing diverse groups of people worldwide and my professional and business background will help me provide value to the commission and achieve an apolitical consensus.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I represented international, privately-held companies for over 35 years in the US and outside the US.  This offered countless opportunities to work for solutions with diverse constituents around the world.  An advocate by training, I was taught (and lived by) the tenet that in order to represent one&#39;s client ably, one must be able to articulate the opposing side&#39;s position as well as one advances one&#39;s own.  My professional success was attributed directly to my ability to help my clients see all sides, i.e., what my mentor described as the ability to let my clients have things my way.  I believe I have the ability to articulate without being pedantic, and most importantly, I have the ability to listen, learn and adjust my views, necessary skills to achieve consensus in any context.  As an example, much of my business life involved clients who traded commodities and were among the very best in the world at doing so.  The trading business is very humbling.  Those who are convinced of their own correctness, who are unwilling to fairly judge the facts, risks and rewards, are doomed to quick failure.  I succeeded in that business for over twenty years.  My success was directly attributable to my ability to be ovjectively assess facts and reject every possible decision bias.  In 2002, I was hired by Buckman Laboratories International to be their chief lawyer in 2002. We did business in over ninety countries and our associates spoke over a dozen languages.  My job necessitated regular travel to Asia, Africa, South America and Europe, but it was common to hear several different languages spoken daily at our headquarters.  Because our company pursued excellence in science, we developed and benefitted from a very diverse group of employees from around the world.  Daily I encountered diverse people and unique problems that required listening, interpretation, understanding and achieving consensus, and I excelled in our company&#39;s decision-making process.  My job as board secretary and general counsel required continually achieving consensus among a very diverse and very talented board of directors for a company that was owned more than 50% by women, and I was pretty good at it.  In sum, I&#39;ve been traveling and working around the world from a very early age.  I believe my mathematics and legal education, work and personal background provided many rich tests in evaluating issues objectively and working towards consensus.  I&#39;m confident I can apply my skills to assist our redistricting commissions.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My first undergraduate degree is in Mathematics.  My studies included both traditional Mathematics, statistics and computer science.  The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of formal logic systems and the deductive power of formal proof systems.  Understanding the philosophy of logic was key to achieving my Mathematics degree.  Mathematics and mathematical logic is an excellent preparation for law school and practicing law.  My legal career necessitated proficiency in analysis, logic and reason.  A lawyer lacking any one of those skills will be unable to communicate and persuade, and will not succeed.  As but one example, I worked in the United Kingdom for several years during which the UK government decided to develop a regulatory framework for hitherto unregulated commodities and companies based there.  The issue became how to develop regulations that were at once transparent, provided accountability to government and yet fostered development of a robust and reputable industry benefitting the UK and EU  My role was part of a 35-person business and government task force that over several months developed what became the regulations for commodity trading in London and Brussels.  If our task force had failed to equally address all aspects of our charge, we would&#39;ve failed.  That process involved constant focus on solutions that would withstand inquiry, examination and criticism from every angle, recommendations that would be understandable, reasonable and logical.
