        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Charles Smith</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Charles Smith
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Cap Smith</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Decision scientist working at Colorado State University
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  PhD in Decision Science and Information Systems, University of Arizona
BS in Mechanical Engineering, MIT
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80525
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
As a faculty member at CSU, I deliberately avoided participation in special interest groups.  I believe that by maintaining neutrality on political and social issues, I fostered an atmosphere with my students that promoted free exchange and critical thinking.  So rather than directing my energies to causes that I admire, I have directed my service directly to my students.  For example, using my uncompensated personal time to coach students for international competitions.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated to Amy McGrath in her campaign against Mitch McConnell for the US Senate in Kentucky.  I donated to Pete Buttigieg during the 2020 presidential primaries.  I&#39;m not sure if this counts as &quot;political,&quot; but my wife and I donated to the ACLU to help them support the children who were separated from their parents while seeking asylum.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have served as an officer in each of the HOAs of which I have been a member for the last 20 years, most recently as the President of the Miner&#39;s Lake HOA.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I think, like many Coloradans, I have become concerned about the polarization of political discourse in our country.  I became interested in the redistricting process after stumbling across a monograph by Professor Robert Loevy who participated in the 2010 effort in Colorado.  That spurred me to read &quot;RatF**ked&quot; by David Daley.  Clearly, redistricting is a complex process involving multiple competing priorities.  That type of problem is one with which I have a great deal of expertise.  I have specialized expertise in data analysis and the design decision support systems.  My research is focused on problems involving temporal and geo-spatial uncertainty.  I believe I have a lot to offer the Colorado redistricting effort: I have the time, the interest, and the expertise.  I think I also have the right demeanor  -- I am an idealist but not a zealot.  When facing conflict, I seek out a solution having the most good for the most stakeholders.  In summary, I want to serve because I think I can add value to the process, and because I believe that a successful redistricting process in Colorado might serve as a positive model for our country.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I think the key to resolving conflict will be to discover the shared values among the stakeholders.  This requires the ability to listen and have empathy.  Those are skills I possess.  Not all values are shared, and in that case, it is important to understand the relative importance of the goals for each stakeholder.  The process of promoting consensus involves finding ways to promote the shared values while also trading-off on the relatively less-important unshared values.  I have a lot of experience with this sort of small-group decision process via many years of faculty meetings and neighborhood meetings.  Obviously, the stakes in those examples are much lower, but the process is the same: how do you reach agreement without creating animosity among people you work with or live near?  In the case of redistricting, I think I am aided because I don&#39;t identify with any political party, so I don&#39;t view the process through the lens of winning and losing.  Rather I think I can be fair and impartial while working towards the shared goal of finding the best district boundaries that achieve the priorities of the Reapportionment Amendment and the Hobbs decision.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am a decision scientist by training.  I have spent more than 30 years conducting research into decision scenarios that are characterized by high stakes, time pressure, and uncertainty.  My earlier work involved the study of decision making in teams and small groups, and so I am an expert in processes used to form consensus in heterogeneous groups.  More recently, I have been investigating biases in judgment and perception related to geo-spatial reasoning -- for example, estimating the location of landfall for a hurricane, or the best location to search for an aircraft lost at sea.  The process of redistricting involves many of these same geo-spatial biases.  My research has been funded by several federal agencies, most notably the Office of Naval Research.  I am especially skilled at transforming the findings of my research into practical guidance for sailors and Marines.  I look forward to bringing these same capabilities to bear on the Colorado redistricting effort on behalf of all the citizens of our state.
