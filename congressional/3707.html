        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Dana Rosaline Manyothane</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Dana Rosaline Manyothane
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>none</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a program manager for Scientific and Cultural Facilities District (SCFD).
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a BA in Biology from the University of Colorado-Boulder.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80031
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not been actively involved in past political activity or donated to any political campaigns or other political organizations.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have been active in the Colorado Black Arts Festival for seven years. I served as Executive Director before my departure to work at the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District (SCFD). At SCFD, I work with several arts, culture, and science organizations. The organizations range from the Denver Zoo and Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science to tiny bell ringing organizations and chorales. Part of my duties at SCFD is to work with county cultural councils with appointed members to ensure state statutory requirements are being followed during organization funding allocations. I have the honor of working with non-profits, governmental agencies, and employees to ensure procedurally we are honoring the will of voters.  
Also, I served on the board of directors for the Colorado African Organization for two years. Last, I am involved with my children&#39;s school community as a member of their Building Advisory Accountability Committee.

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I am passionate about providing opportunities for inclusion, equity, and opportunity. All organizations that I aligned with are about engaging the community in opportunities for sustainability, equity, and a sense of belonging. As a well-rounded leader, I have experience in delegating, planning, analyzing, and advocacy in my professional and volunteer experiences.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The democratic process is sacred to me. I stand on the shoulders of elders and ancestors that have come before me to be a part of a process that speaks to the freedoms we have as Americans. I am a native Coloradoan, and I want to do more for my beloved State of Colorado. I have voted, and now I want to do the work necessary to advance democracy in Colorado. The work needed to carry out Colorado residents&#39; wishes to address Colorado adopted Amendment Y in 2018, which empowers citizens like me to be a part of the process to conduct redistricting.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I fervently believe that everyone has a voice, and every voice should be heard. I am able to listen to anyone with an opinion, even if it is the opposite of my views and beliefs. I have learned over the years through family, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances that sometimes a robust discussion and consensus are necessary to get things done. I can hear and find commonality in most situations. This skillset serves me well in my role at SCFD by committing to organizations&#39; success as they provide accessibility to the residents of the cultural district. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a former Executive Director of a community-based non-profit, I am used to looking at complex information and distilling it down to what&#39;s necessary to have a final outcome. I am accustomed to looking at financials, spreadsheets, comparing data, to name a few of my skills. I am thoughtful and look for answers to problems.
