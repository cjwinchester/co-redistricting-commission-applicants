        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for MICHAEL A ROLLIN</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  MICHAEL A ROLLIN
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

  I am a trial and appellate lawyer. I am a partner with Foster Graham, Milstein &amp; Calisher LLP
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Juris Doctor, University of Denver College of Law (2003). I am licensed to practice law in Colorado, California, and New York, as well as many federal district and appellate courts. I graduated first in my law school class and attained a number of educational and professional recognitions, including as a 2017 Law Week Colorado &quot;Lawyer of the Year.&quot;

</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80138
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Other than the few political activities described above, my only representation of, or advocacy for, &quot;groups, organizations, or associations in Colorado&quot; has been as pro bono legal counsel to the Palmer High School Gay/Straight Alliance in 2004-5 in an action against the school district seeking recognition a a school club. Otherwise, as a lawyer, my engagements have been for individuals and/or were commercial in nature.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have placed signs and flags for the Obama and Biden campaigns at my home; attended a rally for President Obama during the 2012 campaign, and recently waived a Biden/Harris flag on a street corner in Parker. I donated to Phil Weiser&#39;s campaign for Attorney General as well as to the America Israel Political Action Committee (AIPAC). 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have not been a member of any such organizations, but I have been a supporter of, attended events to benefit, and/or done volunteer service for the Colorado Hispanic Bar Association, the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, El Sistema of Colorado, the Colorado Women&#39;s Chamber of Commerce, the Colorado Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the Denver Public Schools Foundation, Colorado Children&#39;s Hospital, the America Israel Political Action Committee, and the National History Day statewide competition. I recently volunteered to judge a writing competition sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League, though that has not started yet.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Redistricting is critically important, and I believe Colorado&#39;s new system can appropriately de-politicize the process. I believe I have the experience, judgment, and skill set to effectively collaborate with fellow commissioners, communicate with the public, and reach reasoned decisions consistently with the purpose of the commission. 

I am also a public-spirited person. Before becoming a lawyer, I served my community as a deputy sheriff, and since earning my law degree have devoted a substantial amount of time to pro bono legal services. I view membership on the commission as another opportunity to continue to serve my state and community. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I consider myself a very collaborative lawyer, even for a litigator. I have worked cooperatively with opponents to solve high-stakes commercial problems, and I have maintained good relationships with opposing counsel long after our cases concluded, which I think speaks to my collaborative approach to problem solving. That said, I can be a staunch advocate for important principles--which I support with analysis, not opinion--but without being disagreeable or overly contentious. I develop facts and apply them to law, but I remain open to different perspectives, as well. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I joke that they beat the creativity out of you in law school, and while I say it tongue-in-cheek, there is still a little truth in that statement. Lawyers are trained to analyze issues in a specific, formalized way. We identify the specific issue in question, develop the relevant facts, apply them to applicable law, and reach a reasoned conclusion. This is called the &quot;IRAC&quot; method. Each step in this analysis is important. If the issue is framed too generally or too specifically or not quite on point, for example, the facts, law, and conclusion will be disconnected from the question presented. The same applies to which facts are &quot;relevant&quot; and which law is &quot;applicable.&quot; After 17 years as a trial and appellate lawyer, I have learned to be precise about these kinds of decisions and analyses. 

That said, all of this analytical ability would be effectively worthless if one did not also have the ability to communicate clearly with people from all backgrounds and to ensure that the views of others are heard and that they are valued, as well. I have broad life experience: I have lived overseas, worked every kind of odd job, served in the military, been a police officer, owned a business, and been and a spouse and a parent. I believe this broad experience helps me relate to, communicate with, and understand the perspectives of a broad array of people.
