<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
For six years served as faculty-student mentor in the Metro State Summer Scholar&#39;s Program for under-represented student populations in the Metro-Denver area.  Prior to this assignment, I served for nine years in the EOP Program as a student mentor and Summer Bridge Program coordinator for California State University of San Bernardino, in preparation for the above assignment at Metro State.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My prevailing interests as a faculty facilitator was helping recruit under-represented student populations in the metro-regional area of Denver, for entry to degree granting progams.  In the process I was involved in the the long term process of designing, developing, and implementing university programs for training first year students in how to succeed in academia.  I was blessed with more than 15 years of successfully working with students in these accredited programs, and mentoring more than 800 students during my tenure in academia; clearly the highlight of more than 25 years as a college teacher.  My motivation for the above is transferrable to the electoral process, I care deeply about social equity, and have a life-long interest in addressing the problems of Urban America, including but not limited to work in cities like: Chicago, Louisville, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, and now Denver.  The place to begin is ensuring that there is a fair and equitable electoral process.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My primary focus in the last 25 years of my life has been on providing access for under-represented student goups to the benefits of a college education.  These efforts are based on a life-long concern for equity and fairness, along with a sense of personal responsibility to each new generation.  The successful outcomes of these programs for more than 15 years, required developing and maintaining long term relationships with students, faculty, and administrators - patiently working together with diverse student and faculty populations - with our objectives clearly in mind.  We cultivated and developed mutual respect and belief in each other - united by the common goals we shared to do something about the inequities we see in our society.  We worked with concepts that are transferrable to many other contexts, including fainess and equity in our electoral processes.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Framing the issues is the first step to effectively address complex social problems.  Peter Drucker identifies the key criteria to efffectively solve problems as the What, the Why, and the How.   Sounds simple.   Not so.  He would tell us that you cannot come up with a means to fix a problem (a How  to), until you know for certain Why something happened.  Then, Peter asked us how can you determine Why&quot; &quot;it&quot; happened if you do not have a clear idea What happened.  It was Peter&#39;s way of teaching us to not get ahead of yourself in the problem resolution process.  Without clarity on What happend and Why, you will never resolve the problem; or your solution will not work.  I am using that simple assessment tool as an example of applying logic and reason to frame problem resolution.  

In public policy analysis per se they use another framework, referred to as the social architecture model which frames problems around the following:  public goods, externalities, natural monopolies, social insurance, and social equity; PENIE.

In the for profit sector or NGO, they use frameworks like SWOT:  strengths, weaknesses, opportunites, and threats.

Each of these are common models for problem analysis and resolution, that apply logic and reason to a given situation.  When a well focused group works together to accomplish a clearly defined set of objectives, they must agree on frameworks like the above, to  engage in the process of applying logic and reason to a particular problem.  I would argue that it starts with the mission and focus of the group, in this case the goal of electoral redistricting.  This criteria, your mission/objectives/goals, determines outcomes.  I am sure that you are aware that colleges and universities are similarly engaged in long-term problem resolution, like student retention, one of the most common objectives of academia.  I have been part of nine-year longitudinal studies on problems like student retention as well as several other common focus groups, like:  becoming a Hispanic Serving University (took us 15 years); improving first year student retention; improving racial equity in faculty recruitment and retention; this list goes on ad-inifinitum.  What it suggests, is that we were successful when we worked together with clearly defined missions, goals, objectives, and desired outcomes.  Transferrable analytical skills and abilities were employed using logic and reason to resolve clearly defined problems.
