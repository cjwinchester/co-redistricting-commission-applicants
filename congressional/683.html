        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Tracey Speaks Allan</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Tracey Speaks Allan
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Tracey Anne Speaks Allan</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently a part time substitute teacher at Colorado Academy. My husband and I also own a medical practice that I managed from 2012-2018. We have a Practice Manager now that handles the day to day operations. I help with strategic planning and fill in when needed. In 2011, I was chosen as a candidate to complete an educator intensive internship to complete my elementary education certificate. I completed this program in 2012. Prior to this, I was a stay-at-home parent raising 3 wonderful humans. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  My primary education, K-12, was in private schools outside Chicago. I received my bachelor’s degree from Northwestern University in Evanston, IL majoring in Philosophy with a minor in Business. I have always had a passion for artistic endeavors and spent the majority of my working career as a hairdresser in downtown Chicago. There, I managed a large salon and oversaw the day to day business as well as HR for nearly 100 employees. During my time in Chicago, I served on the Ranch Triangle (a Chicago neighborhood) Planning Commission. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80235
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I donated to Michael Bennett’s presidential campaign. My husband also donated some to Jaime Harrison and Jon Osoff. It was about ending government obstruction more than political party.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have volunteered with HOPE (Helping Other People Eat) which is a program through Colorado Academy that provides meals, clothing, holiday presents, and activities for nearly 2,000 Denver area residents. I also taught at Horizons which helps children from at risk homes and school districts perform at grade level or above to broaden their opportunities through education. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I believe my experience in managing two companies, strategic planning, day to day operations, as well as Human Resource issues, has given me the skill set to listen to the concerns and objectives of a person, people, or organization and strategize and plan a course of action with the best outcome as the goal. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe in fair representation for all people. This issue is (or should be) not about political beliefs, but about representation of the people and our democracy working for all the citizens regardless of political affiliation or geographic location. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
One of the most useful skills I have learned is to listen to several points of view and distill them down to the essential framework of the issue. I believe this to be the crux of this task. As far as fairness and impartiality is concerned, I have had to practice fairness and being non-judgemental in the classroom and with many patients at the medical practice. The most basic respect is the respect of others to hold their own opinions no matter how different they may be from my own. My political impartiality comes from my Philosophy background. This particular endeavor speaks directly to my belief that politics may change, but finding the consistent universality of a system that can provide the framework for those politics is essential. This task is much bigger than the current political climate that is fleeting. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My Philosophy degree gave me the skills to see the abstract. My business experience gave me the skills to practically apply ideas and strategies. My teaching experience gave me the skills to compassionately communicate.
