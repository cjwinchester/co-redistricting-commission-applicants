<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Colorado Common Cause, Clean Slate Now, Bonnie Brae Neighborhood Association, Association of Government Accountants, Association of Certified Fraud Examiners.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As Colorado Common Cause Board Chair, Treasurer, and Board Member from 2011-2020, I have passionately advocated for Amendments Y and Z and various other pro-democracy issues and bills including testifying before various committees of the Colorado General Assembly.  Common Cause is a nonpartisan grassroots organization dedicated to upholding the core values of American democracy. We work to create open, honest, and accountable government that serves the public interest; promote equal rights, opportunity, and representation for all; and empower all people to make their voices heard as equals in the political process.  Since 1971, Colorado Common Cause has fought to break down barriers to voting, ensure every vote is counted as cast, reduce the impact of special interest money in the political process, and promote open government and high ethical standards in government. We accomplish our goals by working on the ground with our network of grassroots activists, partnering with groups representing diverse constituencies, and working directly with elected leaders.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I was the Board Chair of Colorado Common Cause from 2016-2020 during the time that CCC was a leading proponent of Amendments Y and Z.  These amendments passed with over 70% of the vote, and I want to follow through and do whatever I can to ensure that the independent commissions and redistricting process established by Y and Z reflect the will of the voters, are successful, and hopefully a model for other states.  My entire professional life of 43 years has revolved around the goal of building or rebuilding and maintaining the public’s trust and confidence in government, which is absolutely essential to a healthy and vibrant democracy.  I believe that fair congressional (and state legislative) districts, where the voters choose their elected representatives, rather than elected officials choosing their voters, are essential to earning and maintaining the public’s trust and confidence in their government. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have spent my entire professional career in senior leadership roles with independent nonpartisan organizations including the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Colorado Common Cause, and Clean Slate Now.  These organizations, especially GAO and the OIG, are known for their ability to be independent, fair, and impartial.  I could not have been as successful as I was for as many years as I was with those organizations without consistently demonstrating those same qualities.  I have also been a member and often the chair of a variety of boards and committees providing me extensive experience in principled negotiating, promoting consensus, and creating agreement on contentious issues.  I emphasize &quot;getting to yes&quot;  by understanding and encouraging others to focus on the &quot;interests&quot; of all stakeholders rather than their &quot;positions&quot;.  This kind of process requires identifying interests, separating emotions from the issues, identifying win-win options, and identifying, agreeing on, and applying objective criteria/standards by which to evaluate the options.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As the Manager of the Office of Inspector General, U.S. EPA, Denver, Colorado, April 1991 to September 2008 I directed a professional staff spread from coast to coast in conducting national financial and program effectiveness audits and evaluations of EPA programs, grantees, and contractors.  As a Senior Project Manager with the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), May 1977 to April 1991, I planned, coordinated, directed, and conducted a wide range of financial, grant, interagency agreement, contract, and economy, efficiency, and program effectiveness audits and evaluations.  I met with officials at the highest levels of U.S. and foreign governments and industry, developed recommendations aimed at improving financial and program management by solving complex problems, and prepared written reports for the U.S. Congress.  For the last 10 years, I have been a consultant and instructor of classes teaching others how to do that same work.  This work requires gathering relevant data/evidence about a given organization or public policy problem, analyzing that information, reaching data-driven conclusions and other decisions, and persuasive recommendations.  At GAO and the OIG we used, and I currently teach others how to use, a problem-solving model we call &quot;The Four Elements of an Audit Finding&quot;.  This model, which is sometimes also called a &quot;logic model&quot;, requires (1) identifying or developing &quot;Criteria&quot; that answers the question &quot;what should be?&quot;, (2) &quot;Condition&quot; which answers the question &quot;what is (the current situation)?&quot;, &quot;Cause&quot; which answers the question &quot;why is there a difference between &quot;what is&quot; and &quot;what should be?&quot;, and finally &quot;Effect&quot; which answers the question &quot;so what?&quot; or &quot;what are the negative consequences?&quot;  Applying this model also requires extensive collaboration and coordination with all the stakeholders involved to be successful. I believe this model is applicable to and would be extremely useful to the process of developing fair and representative Congressional districts in Colorado.
