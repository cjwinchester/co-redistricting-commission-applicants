<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
In addition to representing the voice of commercial real estate in Colorado as my fulltime job, I serve on several organizational boards across the Metro area. These include being a Teach For America Champion, which includes an in-depth non-partisan study of Colorado’s public school system and raising money for under-supported students. I have also served as the chair of the Legislative Policy Committee for the Denver Metro Chamber that brings together a diverse political voting board with a focus on supporting both small and large business. 

At times I have worked on policy proposals and supported issue campaign efforts, when ballot items impact the commercial real estate industry. These issues include things like opposing the repeal of the Denver Camping Ban at the local level or opposing tax increases on commercial real estate property or professionals. 

Occasionally, I travel from Denver to talk about issues with groups like the Fort Morgan Economic Development organization because of my family roots in Yuma, Colorado and my connection to the agricultural community. 

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I was a part of the coalition that worked to form Amendments Y and Z, as well as, the subsequent campaign efforts. I recognize how the new process before us today will create fairness and is a historic step toward good government in Colorado. I am dedicated to the work necessary to execute these noble concepts. Additionally, I am a young women who is a fulltime working mother, a demographic representation that benefits Coloradans. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my current professional role and for the past eight years, I manage a politically-diverse voting board. I do not have a vote but serve to provide data, expert opinion and historical perspective for consideration. At times, my most important work is done in the many one-on-one conversations outside the board room, providing board members with additional clarity so that votes are cast with confidence. 

Additionally, I have served on Mayoral task forces and advisory councils for energy, climate or leasing issues. I have given time to the Division of Real Estate, in service to the Colorado Real Estate Commission, on specific Rule revision recommendations. These duties have made me part of diverse groups of citizens with an aim to create fair and open processes for industries or segments of the Colorado population. 

My career in commercial real estate requires I demonstrate impartiality daily. Some consider our industry to have a need to be politically agnostic. The industry maintains a dedication to client service, which include office, industrial and retail tenants with diverse political perspectives. I support an industry based in providing data for decision making. 

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Analytics are the foundation of the commercial real estate industry and revered in our deal-making processes. For more than a decade, I have served a board of directors who expect data and analysis to support any action item. Additionally, when determining a position for a political issue that impacts the industry, I consult outside entities and organizations that specialize in economic analysis and modeling for ballot item outcomes. Data points from these organizations and others are compared and contrasted prior to a formal vote.
