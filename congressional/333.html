<h3>Contact Information</h3>

</p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>

  Senior Corporate Counsel, DISH Network L.L.C.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>

</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>

  80123
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I follow politics as a citizen, but have not engaged in political activity directly since high school, when I went door-knocking for Bob Casey during his successful campaign for Governor of Pennsylvania in 1987.

Pursuant to the FECâ€™s Individual Contribution Database, I have made a total of $1,268.50 in donations to democratic candidates and political action committees.

I would not view my participation on the commission as political activity.

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have also been deeply involved for more than 10 years in multiple states -- including now in Colorado -- in efforts to educate lawyers, law students and judges about ediscovery, a critical stage of civil litigation.  I have donated countless hours to providing continuing legal education programming at academic conferences and guest lecturing at law schools.  Since 2015, I have held the following leadership roles:

LegalTech Educational Advisory Board (2015 - 2018)
LegalTech West Coast Chair (2016, 2017)
Association of Corporate Counsel Information Governance Committee Program Chair (2017)
LegalTech New York Chair (2017, 2018)
Association of Corporate Counsel Information Governance Committee Annual Meeting Program Organizer (2017)
Georgetown Advanced eDiscovery Institute Advisory Board and Planning Committee Member (2018 - present)

I also volunteered for Election Protection in 2018.

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I am relatively new to Colorado.  One reason I chose to move here is to become involved in educational efforts regarding the preservation and restoration of mid-century modern architecture.  I became a volunteer and producer for Denver Modernism Week and joined the founders to plan and organize five sessions to be included in the first virtual event in August 2020.  I personally developed a session with appeal to Coloradans by presenting a home tour of historic Arapaho Hills that educated attendees by celebrating great community architecture in an accessible manner.  My session had the highest attendance of all the DMV virtual programming.

I look forward to getting involved with more Colorado organizations over time.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that the right to vote is the most important Constitutional guarantee to every citizen.  It should be the single equalizing factor across all demographics.  I was encouraged to learn Colorado was forming an independent redistricting commission made up of citizens, because this should remove politics from the analysis.  I have been disheartened by gerrymandering efforts in other states, including several I have lived and voted in.  I believe I can contribute a reasoned approach to the redistricting process that will benefit every Colorado citizen.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am analytical in my approach to fact gathering.  I enjoy productive discussions that are intended to reach a mutual goal.  I am organized in my thinking, speaking and drafting.  I listen before I speak.  I am respectful and will seek knowledge to share with my fellow commissioners.

As an attorney who has been practicing for more than 20 years, I often must negotiate terms with adverse, opposing, or other interested third parties.  I make ethical proposals and I look for reasonable options.  I keep the best interests of my *client* centered.  As a member of the commission, I will view every Coloradan as a client, and my effort will be focused on drawing a map that provides every voter a fair and equal path to having his or her vote counted.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As an attorney, I have handled complex commercial litigation for more than 20 years.  My practice is a cross-section of law and technology, where I regularly build out legally defensible processes.  I have managed large teams of people, leading by example by displaying my values.  I have regularly identified opportunities for improvement, founded practice groups, and established new roles to serve my clients.  I have successfully worked on cross-functional task forces to grow consensus to implement and deploy policies.  I have drafted operational standards, set and measured objectives against results, built alliances, and persuaded C-level corporate leadership to make enterprise-wide improvements.
