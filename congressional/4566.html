<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I would be honored to serve on the Redistricting Commission because, first and foremost, I have a deep love and appreciation for Colorado. The overwhelming passing of Amendments Y and Z are proof that our residents care deeply about equality, fairness, and the true democratic process. We are a state that values diversity of thought and concurrently the need to respect those differences to find a common ground. 
I have lived and thrived in Colorado since I was four years old. Therefore, it is my sincere wish that I return the favor and use every skill that I have to assist our residents in making their communities, as well as those of their neighbors, better places to live, work, and flourish.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
If selected as a Colorado Redistricting Commissioner, I commit to using all skills I have learned through academic education, continuing education, and personal/professional experience to help my fellow Coloradans reach consensus. My academic degrees are in Public Administration, Occupational Therapy, and Theatre. Although these are three very different degrees, they have exposed me to different ways of thinking, different ways of relating to the world, and different values. The common thread in all of my degrees is the paramount importance of putting yourself in someone else’s shoes. This is a critical component of gaining consensus. In addition, I plan to:
•	Establish Trust: following through with requests, being open and honest, and being prepared. 
•	Listen to all public comments, my fellow Commissioners, and Commission administrators.
•	Ask questions: to get clarification, to learn about concerns, to understand the issues.
•	Research all related documents (including maps, regulations, procedures) with abandon-and subsequently effectively explain them, so that stakeholders have the information that they need to reach consensus.
•	Find a common ground:  by observing agreements as well as disagreements, confirming similarities in priorities, making respectful suggestions to all parties concerned.
•	And finally, to lead by example.

My ability to be fair and impartial is rooted in the Golden Rule.  “Treat others the way you would like to be treated.” 
I have been very fortunate in my professional and volunteer endeavors in public, private, and non-profit organizations. These varied experiences have merged with my inherent desire to help others and my strong work ethic. The result is a deep respect for diverse opinions and a never-ending faith we can all work together to create something that is bigger than ourselves.
Another benefit that comes out of my professional and volunteer endeavors is the desire and ability to listen with respect and concern to those who may be uncomfortable communicating in the public arena. Similarly, there will undoubtedly be those who express their opinions in an overly-assertive or forceful manner. I will set the example by communicating in a respectful manner to get to the issues at hand. Along with my fellow commissioners, I will assure that those individuals who may be less assertive are also afforded the chance to speak. 
The goals and required procedures of the Redistricting Commission are guided by Amendments Y and Z. My experiences at University of Colorado in Public Administration and my skills in regulatory analysis at the State of Colorado have prepared me well in ensuring that stakeholder interests, however strong, will stay within all related mandates and regulations.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have developed and sharpened my analytical skills through the health sciences as well as the social/political sciences in relation to my public administration degree. I am abled to take statistical data, summarize it, and understand it. Most of all, I can make logical conclusions and, through collaboration and communication with others, make a reasonable determination on how it may affect a person or a group of people.
