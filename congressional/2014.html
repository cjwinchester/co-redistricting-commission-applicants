</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Our D51 school district has had a couple ballot initiatives within that time period that I supported and canvassed for.  I may have donated to the foundation supporting these initiatives, but I don&#39;t recall specifics and can&#39;t find any public records on this!
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
-I am currently on the board of the Colorado Canyons Association and I serve as its Secretary.  I have been on the board since 2017.  
-Member of the Emerson Park Neighborhood Association in downtown Grand Junction 2017-2018.
-Member of the West Colfax Colfax Neighborhood Association in Denver until moving away in 2016
-Prior to leaving Denver in 2016, I was a member of the Mile High United Way’s Emerging Leaders Council, including service as a member of its steering committee (2013-2014).
-I was a part of the United Way&#39;s 2015 Month of giving campaign as my Denver employer&#39;s campaign coordinator.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a board member for the Colorado Canyons Association, it is my duty to embody our explicitly non-partisan mission to foster community engagement with our local National Conservation Areas. These lands are managed by the Bureau of Land Management for which there are numerous groups entitled to enjoy them. I am an outspoken board member in my belief that our non-partisanship is the foundation of our trust and impact for the community.  Helping the group maintain the clarity provided by our clear mission sounds simple, but is often hard to do in the muddy waters of land-management issues in western Colorado.  One example question we&#39;ve debated - should we engage in the national monuments discussion, given that the board, staff and community have perspectives on it? I was able to help the board avoid spending energy on this topic by reminding as all of the reliable &quot;sieve&quot; we have in our mission, policies and bylaws.  This non-emotional standard enabled everyone to feel the truth in the consensus that engaging on this National Monument topic was not within the mission of our organization.
Within our CCA membership and board, we have representation of all the recreation user groups relevant to the management of our NCAs.  In our meetings I am regularly considering their needs and perspectives to help guide CCA to best serve them and to partner with the BLM in their efforts to also serve these constituents.  I personally represent hikers and rafters in the NCAs, and while in the past I haven’t loved sharing trails with OHVs and mountain bikes, they are now my allies. I hustle to maintain the balance of their access to our shared lands, so that I can retain mine as well. I have worked closely with this diverse team over the past three and a half years in stewardship or our community’s relationship to our National Conservation Areas, amid numerous administrations and federal land managers, local political land issues and through two strategic planning initiatives.
It’s also worth mentioning that prior to leaving Denver I was a member of the Mile High United Way’s Emerging Leaders Council, including service as a member of its steering committee.  During this time I helped facilitate volunteers, learning sessions, and other activities that connected Denver’s young professionals and their companies with the needs of the community.  Through this effort we increased awareness and concern for the struggles of others in our community and in turn grew support for important initiatives like Mile High United Way’s new facility and shelter residences, the Bridge Project as well as 211 expansion and support.  It was rewarding to engage with these initiatives, plus so many other micro-instances of connection and understanding between Denver’s working professionals, our many needy residents and the charitable organizations that connect them all for a better city.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am grateful to live in this state where the politics are respectful and we enjoy a relatively civil and empathetic discourse. I have analytical and organizational leadership skills that would enable me to contribute at an elevated level to our new citizen commission.  I would be thrilled to be a part of our state’s innovations and leadership in the fair election space. Thank you to the people of Colorado for such a cool opportunity to serve!
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
With a strong mission statement and organizing principals as their north star and the will and wherewithal to hold them up as the map for their decision and actions, a commission like this can find productive and peaceful success.  The initial setup will be the foundation for fairness and impartiality.  This is especially true when the path is murky or decisions are emotional.  In the majority of efforts during my day, I am driving teams toward mission milestones.  In the world of software implementations, the standard is an “agile” approach in which we assert a useful mission statement and sprint toward that beacon, using and carrying only the efforts and capabilities that are essential to achieve our milestone.  I am adept at working in this arrangement.  
First, when setting the mission and organizing principals we have to anticipate the path and also the types of diversions and disagreements we’ll face so we can create consensus on how we’ll deal with them.  The more thoughtfully our map and toolbox are apportioned, the smoother our travels to consensus will be.  Second, and this is way more obvious when written than it ever is in practice, run everything you do through the conceptual “sieve” that is your mission.  Don’t waste time debating things that aren’t relevant to that.  There will be debate and lots of it.  It is important to save a team’s capacity for deep contemplation and potentially emotional cognitive space for what is really on the table, and not distractions.  A huge amount of efficiency and joy can be saved with a strong consensus mission and operational track from the start and voices that keep the cart on that track. That’s me.
Finally regarding those voices – reminding us that the only concern should be the mission.  This isn’t simply printing out the organizing documentation and putting it on the team’s desks.  It requires understanding where a person is at in their thinking to help them find a route to the mission in their heart and mind that is common enough to where everyone else’s thinking is headed. Interestingly, while I lead a number of initiatives and engineering teams, I almost never “tell people what to do.”  Instead, I facilitate concurrence and ideation until we all arrive at our next steps together.  I credit the amazing leadership teams I’ve been able to learn from in my career and the innovative space that is engineering in software development for this amazing “agile” way of doing things.  It has infiltrated everything I do, including my engagement with the Colorado Canyons Association and the way we run our family’s household!
I also just have a knack for dealing with a variety of personalities.  I make the joke that I come from a family full of grumpy old men and alcoholics so I know how to keep the peace. As a person who does a fair amount of one-on-one consensus building, I see the great value in the supporting team’s assistance in ensuring compliance with the sunshine rules.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Analytics is my daily mission.  I guide engineering teams to use our software to identify optimizations and improvements in their manufacturing processes. The success of finding truth in their data is the determining factor as to whether they will want to continue to pay us to use our software (they always do). At this point in my career I have a second nature around process engineering systems and resulting data, such that I know the two or three best places to start in a system (is it the temperature controller? Or maybe a sticky valve?) such that I can quickly dive into some key metrics to understand the status and direction of an operational system.
The data around the voting districts will be initially unfamiliar to me, but I would dig in and learn, digest, learn more, digest more until I felt that same situational awareness of what the data meant in terms of the status and direction of the population in Colorado.  The challenge I would be cognizant of personally would be around careful presentation of questions and discussion from my analytical perspective.  I have learned that most of us don’t have a lot of capacity to digest and evolve under the load of tremendous amounts of data and interdependency in numerical understanding.  The press for instance has a hard time relaying order-of-magnitude considerations around big issues facing the world like the pandemic and climate change.  When I’ve worked with teams that don’t live and breathe data like I do, they are less inclined to challenge my assertions and questions.  They take what I say as math gospel, so I have to be more discerning about what I throw out there for consideration. I would work to ensure that when I discuss analytical insights with my peers, I always point out how I could be wrong and what I still don’t understand.  This makes for more internal deliberation work on my part, but would aim toward a result of better clarity and consensus among the team I was working with. If I were selected to be on the commission and found myself surrounded by fellow data wonks, I’d perhaps relax a bit and throw out less-developed questions and ideas, but I’d still initially anticipate being extra-thoughtful about ideas and assertions I put out there, lest they “grow legs of their own” and I unintentionally guide us down the wrong path.
