        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Victoria J Koury</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Victoria J Koury
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>NA</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a retired Attorney at law.  My license was active in Colorado from 1979-2019.  It is currently on Inactive status.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I graduated from the University of Colorado with a BA in 1976 and graduated from the University of Colorado School of Law in 1979.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80305
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated to many democratic candidates since 2015; including but not limited to Hilary Clinton, Joe Biden, Joe Neguse, Jamie Harrison, Steve Bullock, Alice Madden, Diana Degette, Jason Crow, Katie Porter; and organizations including but not limited to MoveOn, DonatetoDems; ProgressiveMajority; VoterProject.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have made telephone calls on behalf of the Colorado Democratic Party several times regarding the 2020 election.  I was a member of the Colorado Bar Association for most of my years in active practice.  I have recently served on the Board of Directors for the Meadows Swim and Tennis Club from 2016-2020.  My term will expire on 11/15/20.  I have volunteered for Intercambio through teaching English to non-English speakers.  In 2016 I did this weekly for 1 Nepali student; however since then I have participated when asked in group classes.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My early legal career involved work as a Colorado State Public Defender.  I was an intern in the Boulder office from 1977-1979 while in law school.  Upon graduation from Law School in 1979 I worked in the Greeley office.  I advocated for criminal justice rights for a largely Hispanic population of indigent clients charged with criminal offenses.  In 1980 I transferred to the Golden office where I represented minority indigent clients charged with crimes.  I was the Head of the Golden Regional office for the Public Defender from 1983-1988.  At that time I moved into private practice concentrating on victim advocacy for patients injured by malpractice caused by physicians and hospital employees.  I also handled some catastrophic product liability cases where we enlisted the Consumer Protection agency to recall products including a child&#39;s toy that caused suffocation resulting in profound brain injury and an aboveground pool with inadequate warnings that resulted in quadriplegia.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Since my retirement from private practice I have more time available to participate in civic issues and I am an &quot;empty nester.&quot; I have lived in Colorado since 1974 and have been witness to great changes, both in terms of population and politics.  I see this commission as a place where I could use my analytical skills to assist with policies that would benefit all Coloradoans. I would not approach the commission with an agenda or specific expectations beyond my attempt to try to do the best for the entire state. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a trial attorney for 40 years, I worked with lawyers on thousands of cases where we represented opposing parties.  I have a good reputation among lawyer adversaries and I have an A+ rating from Martindale-Hubble, the organization that rates lawyers based upon recommendations from peers.  While in active practice, I was asked many times to write letters for future judges, many of whom I had litigated cases against, or in front of I had appeared and they were attempting to move to a higher court.  Last year I served as President of my swim and tennis club and had to navigate many different factions. In March of 2019 our tennis club was facing IRS enforcement issues from claimed tax irregularities from 2015.  I have been working with the IRS enforcement agent since then and who just announced that we have successfully resolved all of our issues, meaning that the $80,000 claimed, has been set aside and we will actually receive a refund.   I enjoy the challenge of bringing people to consensus or at least compromise.  During my years as a litigator, I resolved thousands of cases through negotiated settlements.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Two of my greatest assets are that 1) I am able to pay close attention to details and 2) I am wiling to see both sides of a problem.  While in private practice I focused on medical malpractice cases.  Since I have had no formal medical training, I had to essentially learn the medicine involved for each case I handled.  Whether the case concerned labor and delivery, or a surgical matter which as compartment syndrome, this meant countless hours of study in order to intelligently discuss the case with expert witnesses and take depositions of adversarial physicians and/or other hospital personnel.  Obviously, even when a physician has made an error, 99% of the time, the physician has countless other times performed in a competent manner that was helpful to his/her patient.  Knowing this and appreciating that most of the doctors I sued where good people who had made a mistake in my client&#39;s case, meant being extremely tactful while advocating as forcefully as possible for my injured client.  In order to win I had to understand the medicine thoroughly and yet be able to effectively show the opposing counsel why a jury would likely find against his/her client.
