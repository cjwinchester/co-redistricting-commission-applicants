        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Davin Wilkinson</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Davin Wilkinson
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Generally hospitality is my career of choice but through the current pandemic I have shifted focus to completing a degree.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  In process of completing a B.A. in International Studies with a focus on the global environment, a GIS certificate and a Spanish Minor
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80204
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In the spring of 2011 Scott Tipton brought me, a young teenager at the time, as a guest on a tour of the capital. Hearing the discussions between legislators and John Boehner from a seat on the floor level of congress forever inspired me to deepen an understanding in the country&#39;s political processes. I have not been involved in any campaigns other than promoting social justice and getting friends to vote on social media, but as a young person with a passion for and understanding of political processes in Colorado, I look forward to getting involved. If there are any other opportunities which might correlate to my experience, education, and passion; I would be open to any avenue through which I can participate.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I volunteer weekly with Project Angel Heart. In the summer of 2019 I interned with the City of Aspen Parks and Open Spaces to redesign the city&#39;s GIS database and applications. I have donated to and support the Trans Justice Funding Project, Human Rights Campaign, and Amnesty International.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
It has been a passion of mine to advocate for LGBTQ rights, especially Trans people of color, as well as to work for the rights of disabled persons. During the quarantine I have applied for many volunteer positions to get involved with organizations, and have had the opportunity to volunteer with Project Angel Heart. In the future I hope to work more with LGBTQ organizations as well as work towards linguistic justice in Colorado.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The people of younger generations are starting to realize our role in promoting what we believe in, and because our institutions are overwhelmingly moderated by a consistent demographic, I want to put in the work to bring change. Growing up in Snowmass Village, Colorado has always been my home and I have spent most of my life exploring and learning about the many people and places which make it such an important place. With experience in GIS/mapping, linguistics (specifically Spanish), and the geography of the state of Colorado, I would proudly treat this opportunity as a way to represent my generation in this process of redesigning the geographic makeup of part of our state&#39;s political system. Through applying for this commission, I hope to at least improve the demographics of the applicant pool, and at most step up to the challenges facing our state&#39;s future.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Although the definition of fair is subjective in a system which was fundamentally designed to marginalize specific peoples, I understand that the  ideological geography can be quite variable in the state of Colorado. It is important that promoting equity in one part of the state doesn&#39;t undermine equity in another region.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
To better understand linguistic phenomena of a region,  there is a dialectological process by which a linguist performs statistical analyses on the occurrence by location of specific words/stems which are associated to a specific dialect; by superimposing the dialectal variations over the geography of an area, the ways that language developments influence and are influenced by geographical and sociopolitical environments can be better understood. This example shows to me just how complex the redistricting process can be, there are so many minute statistical factors which can be investigated to provide better understanding of how political representation should be decided upon in our state.
