</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I moved to Colorado in 2012 to work on the frontlines of the Obama for America field campaign in Arapahoe County. After finishing school in 2014, I returned to Colorado to organize young voters on College campuses for the midterm election with Nextgen Climate, and since then, I have continued to organize and advocate for my communities in many different capacities. From 2017-2018, I served as Representative Leslie Herod&#39;s Chief of Staff, working protect and reauthorize the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, and pass the citizen-initiated Caring for Denver ballot measure to support mental health and substance-misuse funding in Denver. Other organizing work I am a part of includes my work as a member of the Colorado Solidarity Fund. CSF is rooted in the values of collective power, equity, community, and inclusivity as we work to support and expand the cooperative/solidarity economy in Colorado. I am also a member of Resource Generation -- we organize young people in Colorado with class and wealth privilege for the equitable distribution of wealth, land, and power. And, I am currently organizing a grassroots BIPOC-led initiative for a Public Bank in Denver, and a QTBIPOC Film series.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As a former-foster kid, first-generation American, and a queer Latinx femme non-binary person with a mixed class background - my life experiences and identities have shaped my philosophy/approach to organizing and advocacy at every step. Several community people I love and trust asked me to apply and serve on the commission to ensure that progressive voices are a part of this critical redistricting work. I see this work as a civic responsibility, and it would be a great honor to represent my communities the Independent Congressional Redistricting Commission.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have been a part of several organizations with flat/horizontal structures that require great facilitation, and cooperation by members. Transparency, clear and fair processes, and acknowledgement of the power dynamics and limitations are few things that I see as important to this type of consensus building. As a commissioner, I believe I could promote consensus building through my empathetic listening skills, a commitment to equity, and making space for vulnerability in the process. I think it&#39;s critical for commissioners to bring a high level of integrity, that is, a commitment to the agreements we make to one another and to this process to ensure fairness. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My undergraduate studies in Economics laid a strong foundation in analysis, logic,  problem solving. My coursework, like Econometrics, gave me tools to analyze complex problems, and test economic hypothesis with empirical data with the application of statistical techniques. While, it&#39;s hardly necessary to build an econometric model for every problem we see in the world, these foundational skills and knowledge can be helpful in understanding complex systems and how to consider many different factors at play in solving a problem. In many of my roles over the last decade, I&#39;ve had to wear several hats at once, and build things from scratch. I pride myself in creative problem solving -- some of this comes from a willingness to fail, learn from it, and start again with a different approach.
