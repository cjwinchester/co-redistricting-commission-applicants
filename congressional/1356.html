        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Edward C. Herlik</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Edward C. Herlik
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Self-Employed.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  BS Engineering with Political Science double major, MA Political Science, Airline Transport Pilot.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80132
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Volunteer in the effort to pass Y &amp; Z.

My other perhaps relevant efforts are all local, such as organizing volunteers to teach character and ethics at a university, organizing neighbors to mitigate against wildfire risks, and organizing neighbors to join the county approval process for a local commercial development.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I volunteered on two presidential campaigns and two congressional campaigns, all in Colorado and for both Democrat and Republican candidates.  The last of those was in 2010.  I have not donated money to any campaign or political organization since November 2015.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Service Academy BizNet Pikes Peak Region (local chapter of a military academy graduate service organization)
Plains &amp; Peaks Mensa (local chapter of a national service organization)
Veterans of Foreign Wars (national fraternal and service organization)
Fairways Homeowners Association (mandatory neighborhood association)
Bent Tree Homeowners Association (mandatory neighborhood association)
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Having worked to pass these amendments, I know they can only succeed if non-partisans continue that work.  This is one of life’s ‘If not now, when?  If not me, who?’ moments.  I mean that, really.

I earned two political science degrees and taught American Government to future military officers.  That officer corps has a well-earned reputation for being the most trusted, least partisan group in our nation.  That’s how I taught as well; non-partisan.  The students still didn&#39;t know my political views at the end of the semester.  That open minded approach attracted me to Y &amp; Z.  It’s also why I’ve been a member of both major political parties at various times in the distant past but have been unaffiliated for many years.

This commission’s goal of ending gerrymandering in Colorado is critical to our democracy and will be a model for our republic.  That’s well worth doing; it’s well worth a citizen’s time and effort.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have an acute sense of fairness.  I support the underdog and resist bullies.  At the most basic level, that’s why Americans with much talent and many options choose to serve our nation in various military and civilian capacities rather than follow easier, more lucrative paths.

I’ve also been a partner in a small data analysis firm, following facts where they led.  That background is certainly relevant to demographics, census data, affiliations such as minority groups, etc.

I believe such experience and qualities will be common among the commissioners and so will contribute to consensus, or at least agreement, that meets the commission’s charter and Coloradans’ intent.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am far more analytical than emotional.  It’s kept me alive in aviation, an unforgiving profession.  I also taught data analysis and forecasting to professional analysts in my small business.  And I have three US patents with a few more unsuccessful applications.  Patents require initiative and insight as well as analysis.

Building on that experience, my business partner and I created a method to measure group cultures empirically and despite the resistance, fear, delusion, etc. that often invalidates surveys.  That’s a current and concrete example of applying data analysis to human issues.

All of that means I see patterns in data and impartially follow them to their logical conclusion.
