        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Daniel Grossman</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Daniel Grossman
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>DANIEL GROSSMAN</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am the Rocky Mountain Regional Director of Environmental Defense Fund, an environmental non-governmental organization. I also serve as the Senior Director for State Advocacy for our Energy Program. I have been at EDF for 14 years. Prior to that time, I was a Colorado State Senator, representing East Central Denver and serving as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In addition, I had my own law practice representing companies and individuals primarily in employment law matters.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Denver East High School, 1986
University of Kansas, BA Political Science, 1990
University of Denver College of Law, JD 1993

</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80238
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
From 2006 until the present, my advocacy has been focused on environmental issues (with a lot of focus on methane emissions from the oil and gas industry) here in Colorado and across the country. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been a registered Democrat in Colorado since 1986. I served as a Democrat in the Colorado House of Representatives from 1997-2002 (Democratic Leader from 2000-02) and the Colorado Senate from 2002-2006. I have given money to several Democratic candidates for state and federal office including Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Mark Udall, John Hickenlooper, Ed Perlmutter, Jason Crow, Nolbert Chavez, and others.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Colorado Independent Ethics Commission (member and chairman), Colorado Public Radio Consumer Advisory Board, Colorado Coalition for the Homeless.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe partisan gerrymandering has truly hurt democracy in or country. Instead of creating true communities of interest, redistricting has been coopted by interests that seek to protect incumbents and maximize partisan advantage. Politically competitive districts, while not possible in every interest, promote a less polarized Congress and present more opportunities for collaborative policymaking.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I served on the state&#39;s Reapportionment Commission in 2001, working on drawing lines for the state&#39;s 100 house and senate districts. I worked hard to build consensus maps that respected communities of interest while promoting competitive districts across the state. While we did have our share of disagreements, at the end of the process we had a plan that worked and that the participants in the process were proud of. I also worked hard to try to build consensus around a new Congressional District map (at that time, crafted by the legislature). While we came close, partisan interests prevailed and litigation ensued, resulting in a map drawn by a federal court judge. I was also in the Senate when Republican leadership attempted to re-draw the map &quot;out of cycle&quot; when they controlled both houses of the legislature. That was a low mark of my legislative career when I was unable to convince my Republican friends of the danger to the institution their midnight gerrymander represented.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a lawyer and public policy practitioner, I bring logic, reason and linear thinking to problems I face every day. I work very hard to ensure that the positions that I advocate for are grounded in science and reason rather than emotion. When I try to persuade people (colleagues, stakeholders, policymakers, etc.) I likewise root my arguments in reason rather than appealing to emotion. That is when I am most successful.
