        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Laura Lee</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Laura Lee
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am self-employed.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  M.H., University of Colorado Denver, Classics concentration
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80903
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been a fairly regular and silent supporter of the Democratic Party for the last several election cycles and have made a very few very small donations to presidential candidates, and other Democratic organizations.

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Aside from attending occasional organizing meetings, I have been unable to actively participate during this time due to my disability. The recent increase in availability of online meetings due to Covid-19 is gradually improving my ability to interact with the community, but I am still in the exploration phase.

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Involvement in community and church organizations was central to my life beginning in elementary school. I was an elected leader in student government and subject clubs in high school and college, and took on leadership roles in choir and theatre groups throughout my life. I have represented my precinct at the state Democratic convention. I have always been a vocal advocate around issues involving equality, social welfare, human rights, education, and the environment. Only since the onset of my disability in 2006 have I pulled back to focus the bulk of my attention toward improving my ability to participate, and I am now feeling the need more strongly to take an active role in the organization and administration of government in Colorado and my local area, city, and county.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have long been troubled by the terribly unequal ability to participate in our society of all the various groups, many of which are not even clearly identified or defined. My disability has elevated my already deep concern for the sufferings and forced silence of those who are not members of the dominant group. Those people whose voices are hard to hear -- or even silenced -- are people who may lack the time, energy, and resources to show up to participate due to their life circumstances, ethnicity, health situation, disability, family obligations, language barriers, lack of education, etc. It seems obvious that when you are not heard, that finding help to solve the problems of your family, your community, and yourself are made even more impossible than it can seem to those who have ready access to the halls of power, and a voice that will be readily listened to. Thus, making the process of electing our representatives in government equally accessible to all citizens, in order to provide needed access and services fairly and appropriately to all members of our community and society, seems to me to be the most essential place to begin solving our collective problems. And helping to determine how citizens will   choose their decision makers through our elections process seems to me to be the foundation of building the fair and equitable society I dream of. The redistricting commission will be making the kinds of  decisions that will ultimately determine whose voices will be heard, and how. I want to serve, because I want to help level the playing field for all citizens.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that listening is the primary skill necessary to reach agreement. When everyone&#39;s voice is heard, when their words are validated by the group members, and taken seriously into account as policy is created; when no one feels that their comments are ignored or discounted, then only can we reach a consensus that will be acceptable to all members. I will listen. I will share my thoughts and research as appropriate. I will encourage others to do the same. I will weigh the merits of the various proposals, and collaborate with other members to create and adapt ideas that will serve the needs of all as fully as possible. When members express disagreement, I will seek to understand and find common ground. I am not happy when I discover that others are unhappy. The happiness of others is essential to my feeling comfortable in the world that we are mutually creating every day. Fairness and impartiality, I believe, results when we set aside our desire to be &quot;right&quot; or have the upper hand, and instead choose to find a way in which all can benefit equally.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My graduate level studies in ancient and modern philosophy helped me more fully develop my reasoning ability. Rather than &quot;going with my gut,&quot; I choose to notice my gut reaction, set it aside, and then gather information, historical data, and the opinions of others to gain an accurate picture of the problem in front of me, from as many angles as possible; categorize and enumerate the various aspects of the issue; and then, considering all that, I approach the problem with the idea of finding a solution that will have the greatest benefit for the most people -- particularly for those with the greatest need -- and the least possible negative consequences, taking into consideration potential unforeseen pitfalls.
