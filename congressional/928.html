</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I have had the great privilege of staying home to manage my household and raise my three boys for the past ten years. I find this my greatest reward and responsibility for the future. I have volunteered in their classrooms and led an afterschool science lab. Most of my focus has been on my children for the first years of their lives, to help them be successful in their formative years. Now that my youngest is in Kindergarten, I am ready and excited to work towards different goals. 

</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a BA in Communication from the University of Colorado at Boulder. The majority of my classes focused on Small Group Communication and Interpersonal Communication. 

</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80023

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In 2016, I made GOTV phone calls for Hillary Clinton’s campaign in the last week before the election. In this year&#39;s election, I wrote letters for a nonprofit organization called Vote Forward. The letters were to encourage voters from underrepresented demographics to vote in the 2020 election. I have not been deeply involved in any campaigns in the last 5 years. 

In 2016, I donated $50 to Hillary Clinton. In 2020, I donated $550 to Joe Biden and $27.00 to Jaime Harrison. 

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
-I have had the privilege and honor of staying home to raise my children. I believe that raising the next generation is one of the most important jobs to have, especially in the first five years of a child’s life. I have been in the fortunate position to stay home and focus on their needs. Since November 2015, I have had small children in my home, so most of my focus has been on giving my three children a solid base to start their lives. I have volunteered every year since 2014, for class parties and other special events at their schools, and I have helped preschool teachers with small class projects to alleviate some of their burden. 
-In the 2016-2017 school year, I ran a weekly after school program through the STEM Scouts. I had a class of 15 second and third graders, that I engaged in different STEM concepts throughout the school year. 
-In Spring of 2019, I volunteered at the Bal Swan Children’s Center Multi Cultural Fair.
-In Spring of 2019, I worked with the executive staff at Bal Swan Children&#39;s Center, to help them develop their summer camp STEM program for elementary school-age kids. 

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
In 2016, I was a founding lab manager for STEM Scouts, which is an affiliation of Boy Scouts of America. I managed an afterschool science lab for fifteen students at Stargate Charter School. The program was originally designed for third to fifth graders. The lab I managed was a group of second graders. My lab was the only second grade lab in the entire country. The lab was created because there was a group of second grade parents at Stargate who were interested in the program for our children. I successfully lobbied STEM Scouts to let us run a pilot program for this age group. I managed the lab, reworked the material and curriculum, and advocated for the class when problems arose from the STEM Scouts guide book and materials. I also advocated within our lab for families who were unable to provide after school snacks for their children, by creating a rotating list of parent snack days so no child went hungry after school. 

In 2005, I was the committee chair for the ACLU Young Professionals. I helped the committee facilitate discussions and plan the ACLU Young Professional events in Denver. The committee was in charge of planning and hosting monthly ACLU Young Professional events. Our monthly events included a diverse group of speakers who spoke about different topics related to civil liberties. All events took place in art galleries in the Denver Metro Area, highlighting local galleries and artists in a variety of neighborhoods. 

In 2005, I was the founding President of the Broomfield Young Democrats. I worked to engage young Democrats in the Broomfield area by hosting various events in Broomfield. One event was a ‘Meet the Candidates’ forum for City Council candidates. All of the candidates, including Republicans, came to our event to engage with young Democrats. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated by our government&#39;s history and how it functions. Through school my favorite topics were American History and Government and I have sustained this interest throughout my adult life.  I have always viewed the government through a lens of fairness.  I try to consider how equitable and fair our government is to the people it represents. The very basic level of fairness can be seen through the context of the electoral maps and how they are drawn. When districts are manipulated in certain ways, the map can benefit those already in power, at the expense of the constituents in gerrymandered districts. If maps are drawn unfairly, it can be difficult to vote out elected officials who are not performing satisfactorily or advancing the will of the people who they are elected to serve. 

I believe it is important to create fairness in how our government is run and in the selection process. Fair maps elevate the principle of “one person, one vote.” Fair maps also hold elected officials accountable to the people they serve. The best way to create fair electoral maps is to take into account a multitude of different factors, including an area&#39;s demographics. 

It would be an honor to be a part of this process. I know I have the skills and passion to help our great state. This would also set an example, for the rest of our country, on how to create fair maps. I have always strived to incorporate fairness in my daily life and I have taught my children about fairness and equality. Being a part of this process would be a pivotal way to set those beliefs into action. 

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In this tumultuous time in our union, I still believe there is more that binds us than divides us. I also believe that on topics that I differ with someone else, I cannot ask them to accept my opinion or point of view if I am not willing to listen to their beliefs or experiences. In this thread, there can be commonalities with every person you meet. There may not be agreement on everything, but there is always some common ground. Once that common ground is found, you can build from there and connect the dots to other places of agreement. 

When I was the chair of the Young Professionals Committee at ACLU, we had a diverse group of committee members. Our committee members came from a multitude of backgrounds; because of this, everyone brought different strengths and ideas. This committee was very impactful on my life. Not only did listening to the committee members make us all smarter and give us a better product for our monthly events, it made me more compassionate and empathetic to people who were very different than me. My tendency for inclusivity was one of the reasons I was given the chair position after one month on the committee. I always listened intently, believed in our collective group and was proud of the outcome.

Everyone who will be on this committee will be there for the reason of making Colorado more fair through the Legislative and Congressional maps. We are Democrats, Republicans and Unaffiliated individuals who come from a multitude of backgrounds. We have all applied and will have been accepted to make a positive impact on our state. I fully intend to use the tools from my previous work and volunteer positions to work with all the other commissioners to make a positive impact on our state maps.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
For the 2016-2017 school year, I was the lab manager for the afterschool STEM Scouts at Stargate Charter School. The STEM Scouts program was designed for third to fifth grade students as an intro to STEM curriculum. To expand this program to second graders, I adapted the entire program to meet the needs of this age group. I created weekly labs to educate the kids and foster love and curiosity for science. I researched and brainstormed each topic to create age appropriate labs and activities to engage fifteen 7–8 year olds. I developed multiple station labs to keep them involved and motivated for a 90-minute science lab. After each week&#39;s lab, I analyzed how the lab went and would come up with ideas as to how to improve the lab for the students. Not only was I in charge of running the experiments; I also mediated disagreements between students in lab groups to help foster habits of sharing, taking turns and working towards a common goal in each lab. 

When I worked at Enterprise Rent-A-Car from 2003–2009, I worked in the Loss Control Department, where I held a broad range of roles and responsibilities. My main job focused on risk management assessment and prevention at the car rental locations and property damage claims for the vehicles. I analyzed data and helped with strategic planning for long term budgeting based on damage losses and risk assessment.

As a member of the management staff in my department, I created, administered, and reviewed audits and training for Rental Branch and Loss Control Department employees. I also assisted in plan development for rental branch locations and employees not meeting adequate standards, to reach or exceed compliance and training.  

As the lab manager of the STEM Scouts program, I had no formal science or teaching background. I did, however, have a background in finding and analyzing data and training employees at Enterprise Rent-A-Car. I was able to take that knowledge and use it in a completely different situation. I would like to be able to apply that same data analysis skill set on the commission to ensure that we have fair and equitable maps for the next 10 years.
