        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Valerie A. Leal-Whitehead</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Valerie A. Leal-Whitehead
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Valerie Ann Leal-Whitehead, Valerie Leal-Whitehead</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Banner Health, Cardiovascular Institute, 20 years.
During my tenure here I have written our policy and procedures, helped to set up our stress testing services, served as supervisor responsible for hiring/terminating/evaluating staff, and I currently provide phone nurse triage , walk in patient care and other miscellaneous tasks.
Prior to my current position:
NCMC [Banner Health], Telemetry nurse 1981-85, Cardiac Rehab/patient education 1985-1998; Cardiac Research nurse 1998-2000 with the Heart and Vascular cardiology group [now affiliated with UC Health].  I also substitute taught at UNC [University of Northern Colorado here in Greeley]  in the kinesiology department in the late 1980s, during a time they were in a bind with professors. I taught electrocardiography and stress testing for two separate quarters.  Over the course of my career I have been provided with many opportunities to present/teach in a variety of settings and teaching is something I enjoy a great deal.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  University of Northern Colorado, School of Nursing, 1981 BSN, RN licensed in CO, Certified Exercise Technologist, ACSM [American College of Sports Medicine]
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80634
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Phone banks, door knocking for Democrats during presidential election years, [occasionally in non-presidential years]with the exception of this year. I donate to the Democrats during presidential election years, usually no more than $200 for the campaign cycle.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Most of my volunteer service in the last five years has been through my church. 

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I served three terms on our local board of education, from 1993 - 2003. As noted above, I worked for the Democrats during presidential elections with the exception of this year. My church callings have included teaching young children, teaching adults, working with young women as advisor, camp director and community philanthropy work associated with the youth.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
With the exception of a run for our Board of Education 10 years ago, I have not served nor run to serve my community in any official capacity in some time. I learned of this opportunity at a recent Women&#39;s March and I decided to apply. My years of professional experience, and my prior years on our local board of education, along with my desire to &quot;get back into things&quot;, will make me a good choice for this commission.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
When I served on our local Board of Education, it was during a contentious time [in terms of opinions re: public education] in our community. I was able to form good relationships with members of the board whose views were significantly different from my own.  In my professional life I have served as mentor, supervisor, educator and trainer; based on feedback from my immediate supervisors I believe I have been fair and honest in my interactions with colleagues. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am a nurse; in my field and current role there is analysis involved in every triage call and in most patient interactions.  I am good with people, with &quot;service recovery&quot; when that situation occasionally occurs, and with communicating important information in language each patient understands.  I am passionate about many things, sometimes very vocal, but generally objective when it comes to addressing problems.
