<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I am fiercely passionate about women and children&#39;s equitable treatment in Colorado and have formed two different startups to address the skyrocketing cost of childcare in the case. As stated above, I have participated in training and leadership programs in an effort to work with different groups and draw attention to the equitable treatment of all people in Colorado.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that this commission will greatly impact the way that Colorado voters are recognized, and I think that having an opportunity to influence and share what I have learned about the vast differences in the groups that I have participated in and with would help the decision making as well as the outcomes of this redistricting.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have been brought into both for-profit and non-profit organizations as a specialist who uses inquiry and questions to bring people together. I have an ability to see both sides of an argument, or debate, and work with both of those sides to come to a resolution. I believe that negotiations start with and end with respect, and that common ground is found in addressing immediately discrepancies or perceived disrespect in how we communicate or the tones and words we use.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I passed the LSAT, and once wanted to be a lawyer. Instead, I used the money that I had saved for my own tuition to send my struggling teenage son to a private school that could support his behavior issues. I still believe that I am called to use logic and reasoning to be a mediator and seek out opportunities and businesses where I can influence and create pockets of freedom and encourage equitable treatment of all employees and organizational members. I have worked with tens of companies (nearly a hundred) to create change management and equitable practices. I&#39;ve honed my skills by working with many different groups and had to do much personal and professional development to explore my own bias and perceptions that affect how others are or have been treated by me.
