</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
No formal role. During the 2016, 2018 and 2020 elections, I was involved at the grassroots level as a volunteer - organizing small fundraisers, writing postcards to voters, phone banking, canvassing, registering new voters and making donations to progressive candidates both in Colorado and around the country.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that serving as a volunteer commissioner in the redistricting process is one of the most meaningful contributions I could make to my state in the coming year. The redrawing of Colorado&#39;s congressional districts based on updated census information through these two new independent redistricting commissions is vital and could serve as an important framework for making our local, state and national elections more fair and transparent for all of Colorado&#39;s residents. We need to get this right, as it will shape the outcome of our state (and possibly country) for decades to come. 

As an engaged citizen that identifies as Latina, I am well qualified to understand the perspectives of a broad range of my fellow Coloradans. When the commission travels around the state next year seeking feedback from various constituents, I would be able to actively participate in bilingual sessions since I am fluent in Spanish. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Having never served on a commission of this nature before, I&#39;m not sure how the process will go. But based on the thoroughness of this application process, I am hopeful that only qualified candidates who are genuinely interested in serving the best interests of our entire state will be selected. 

If I am selected, I pledge to be a fair, engaged and thoughtful representative for all Coloradans. Based on my extensive experience working with diverse constituencies in business, the non-profit sector and as an active volunteer serving on various community initiatives, I have always strived to be fair and impartial. I believe it is important to listen to all sides and find common ground. As a swing state, Colorado is uniquely positioned to demonstrate how to bridge the political divide in its new redistricting process. I would be honored to participate in this important effort.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As you can see from my attached resume, I have extensive experience in business and community engagement which serves to highlight the requisite analytical, logic and group problem-solving skills needed for the important task of working on a bipartisan commission to analyze and present workable solutions to Colorado&#39;s redistricting challenges. 

Over the past three decades, I have lived on three separate continents and found meaningful ways to be involved in all of them. When I was a mother of younger children, I primarily focused on education issues. My family has been actively involved in environmental issues for many years, currently focused on efforts to combat climate change. Since we moved to Colorado over 13 years ago, I have actively participated in our state&#39;s local democratic process believing that was the most impactful way for me to make a positive difference in my community. I am eager to devote my time and attention to a new challenge in the coming year and believe I am uniquely well-suited for consideration to represent my district on Colorado&#39;s new Congressional Redistricting Commission.
