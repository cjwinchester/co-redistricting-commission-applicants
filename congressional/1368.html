<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I served on the City of Littleton Planning Commission for 3 years where we considered many contentious issues and had to work together to find workable solutions.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am passionate about redistricting and have always been interested in how district boundaries are drawn. I know the importance of fair districts to promote equity. Some of the election problems we have seen in our country are due to gerrymandered districts. It&#39;s important that districts make sense both geographically and politically - geographically in the sense that they do not spread across the entire state and politically in the sense that boundaries are not drawn solely for the purpose of favoring one party over another. I want to bring my intellect, passion for the issue, impartiality, and consensus-building skills to make sure districts are drawn fairly in our state. Please see my personal statement for more.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have lived in a co-housing community for the last 15 years. One of the guiding principles of co-housing communities is that we operate by consensus. Our community of individuals who own the 40 homes here have to work closely together to reach agreement on all issues. Although we have a Steering Team for the community (which I have served on twice), most decisions are made by all community members using consensus. I sometimes facilitate community meetings, and when I served as Treasurer for 5 years, I facilitated all meetings about the budget process each year. Those meetings were often lengthy and required a lot of dialogue and deliberation to reach decisions all could agree to. I will bring those consensus skills to the commission and creating agreement among the commissioners. 

Even when I served as president of numerous organizations, I always viewed my role as facilitating the discussion and allowing all viewpoints to be heard. My role was not to come in with my solution and try to get everyone to agree to that solution. My role was to create dialogue to hear all perspectives. I would take that same approach in serving on the redistricting commission.

Finally, I have been a professional coach for almost 20 years and the primary skill required for that position is excellence in listening. I listen to clients every day and work to understand their viewpoint. Having coached over 1000 people from 38 countries and many different industries, I know how to work well with individuals from many different backgrounds.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My college education was rigorous in teaching how to apply analytical skills to both verbal and written expressions. Law school was even more rigorous in that regard. I am very skilled at applying logic and reason to problems.
