<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My professional and personal endeavors are driven by the desire to listen carefully and the intent to act thoughtfully and with respect to the voices and interests of all parties. As an Assistant Attorney General representing Colorado state departments and agencies my organizational and advocacy skills developed quickly, helping me to represent interests of my clients (both human services and law enforcement related) in civil matters in federal and state courts, administrative hearings, rule-making proceedings and as counsel to a state board. As a member of a Colorado Bar Association committee I drafted information about guardianships and conservatorships for posting on a judicial website and served on a committee developing standards within the judicial context for Guardians ad Litem.  As a Colorado state appointed member of a Human Rights Commission (and Chair of the Board for 2 years) I assisted in consideration of various interests and concerns brought to the attention of the Board. In my pre-law school career I was an exhibit designer for Denver Children&#39;s Museum and collaborated with educators, parents and financial supporters to develop experiences encouraging interactions of children and adults of all abilities. (I will upload my resume to provide additional details.)
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My professional and community service in education, human services, and legal improvement areas provide a balanced background for working with a team on redistricting issues. As an attorney (38 years) practicing in diverse areas of both public and private sector law and in a variety of forums and contexts, I am comfortable and enjoy interacting with people - hearing their stories and interests and helping to interpret systems with a goal of finding a concensus on what works. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Both as a mediator and a retired litigator, my objective is to help people identify the value (this is not necessarily economic) in their interests and to assist them in building a resolution that serves all in some way.  As a mediator, litigator and board member in sometimes very heated discussions I find a way to help identify ways to evaluate sometimes diverse perispectives and find some unity.  The best outcome is reached when all parties contribute to the process of dialogue and find some shared values. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>

Both my litigation background and my mediation practice involve logic and analytical skills.  Briefing for appellate courts and preparing comments to share at a board meeting involve these skills.  In mediation a thorough analysis can assist parties in taking steps to find a resolution.

My advocacy in private sector legal practice has included representation of business entities, mental health respondents (involuntary treatment and medication proceedings), persons incarcerated in Colorado corrections facilities (civil issues), juveniles and parents in dependency and neglect proceedings, and service to Colorado state courts as judicially appointed Guardian ad Litem for adults with disabilities and for minors in probate and juvenile proceedings. mental health respondents (involuntary treatment and medication proceedings), persons incarcerated in Colorado corrections facilities (civil issues), juveniles and parents in dependency and neglect proceedings, and service to Colorado state courts as judicially appointed Guardian ad Litem for adults with disabilities and for minors in probate and juvenile proceedings.
