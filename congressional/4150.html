        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Rae Anne Stout</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Rae Anne Stout
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Rae Anne Brendecke</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a career counselor and adjunct faculty member at the university of Colorado 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I hold a Master of Arts in Community Counseling, a Bachelor of Arts in history, Bachelor of Arts in religious studies, and a certificate in the study of religion &amp; conflict. I also am a licensed professional counselor and a certified career counselor. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80216
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have voted in almost every single election (apart from primaries) since turning 18. There was a brief period of time when I moved to Colorado, and wasn’t sure if I would stay in CO, where I abstained from voting in the local election given that I might not stay. I think voting is one of the most beautiful privileges awarded to Americans, and I deeply respect the process. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I serve on the non-profit board for the Colorado Career Development Association. The organization is responsible for providing free and low cost trainings for CO’s career development and Career &amp; Technical education (CTE) professionals working in non-profits, workforce centers, k-12 schools, community colleges and higher education. I served as president and past president from 2016-2018. I also volunteer for the non-profit National Career Development Association’s government relations committee, where we work with the American Counseling Association and a lobbyist retained by NCDA to discuss issues impacting workers, career development professionals, and community members at large as it relates to career development needs. Our work is non-partisan, and my role is to disseminate information locally and to other state leaders, not to influence or dictate the work of the lobbyist. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As an educator and career counselor, I diligently work to advocate for Coloradans around affordable access to school and removing barriers to working. This includes training Colorado high school counselors on working with students under CO’s ASSET, career needs of LGBTQIA+ Coloradans, individuals previously involved with the justice system and more. I have volunteered at experiences like Project Homeless Connect and Convoy for Hope, providing free resume &amp; job search assistance for individuals in need. I have brought forth needs of Coloradans to our NCDA government relations committee and our lobbyist. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve Coloradans in a way that helps encourage and maintain equality in voting opportunities. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Using words drawn from CliftonStrengths, I have the includer, context, empathy and WOO strengths. What this means is I want every person to have a seat at the table and a say in the conversation. I see other’s points of view with empathy and respect, and also search for the context behind their point of view. My context strength also gives me a knack for understanding details, history and how different puzzle pieces of a problem can fit together better. Lastly, WOO stands for winning others over. One of my best strengths is motivating others to work together for a common good. On top of this, I am a counselor first and foremost, which requires me to withhold judgement and to uphold other’s values as I uphold my own. Because of all of this, I think I’d be a great asset to creating agreement amongst commissioners while remaining impartial. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My contextual strength and background rooted in historical studies provides me a lot of strengths around analyzing problems from all angles. While I may first approach with empathy, I am also able to use reason, process through various logical considerations and use my big picture contextual skills to play out different scenarios or answers to problems quickly and efficiently.
