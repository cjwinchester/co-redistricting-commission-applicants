</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As a native of Florence, CO, and Pueblo resident since 1999, this Colorado District 3, has been redistricted for as long as I can remember. Also, we need to carefully review many of the other rural demographic  diverse region   around the state to ensure every group of Americans, including Latinx and low income groups, throughout the state are at the table of decision-makers. This is an ideal opportunity to change the course of a history of neglect.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a minority, who has worked in many administrative positions in government, private industry and universities/colleges, I have experienced first-hand the abuses of government (often unintended, but the damage is NO LESS). We need to get the right people around the table, that has simply not been the case. One can only built consensus when social justice prevails and all groups believe they are fairly represented; in essence, I have been lucky/or unlucky to serve and witness first-hand  to see &quot;how consensus&quot; was not done, and it was a learning experience... We need to build from where we are, and work toward &quot;consensus building.&quot;  It will not be easy, but nothing I have ever achieved was easy.  ... JUST NECESSARY.  Change takes time, but on this issue of redistricting, it is way past time for change and do it right.  We need to ensure &quot;the voices&quot; of different constituencies--rural, Latinx, and non-traditional groups ARE VALUED. They represent the best of &quot; all our tomorrows and all those tomorrows will make the state and country a better place from which to LEAD.&quot; 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In this case, one should have in mind a plan to ensure the entire state is fairly represented. Permit me to speak freely of my work effort over a lifetime:  1) Being a good listener, to understand the problem.  I was all ears when I was learning about federal education policy and programs; 2) Define clearly the problem, too often groups are unclear of what is the &quot;real problem&quot; that needs solving:  3) Working with others in Washington D.C. on public policy impacting federal or state education policy--it was a team effort; Working as a &quot;team&quot; i e.,  we set in place policy guidelines for Title 9, federal policy for women athletics participation nationwide, it was a team effort while working in the Assistant Secretary for Education Office  4) working toward policy of solving questions and issues leading to group leadership. In doing so, the group learned the &quot;sum is greater than its parts.&quot;  So too, should be the case with all of Colorado areas and various legislative districts; and 5) as a group, I worked in 1978-79 with Hispanics to testify before Congress to begin the dialogue to develop &quot;Hispanic Serving Institutions&quot; (HSI&#39;s) legislation for all colleges with over 25% Hispanic enrollment to apply for set-a-side funding. Our successful efforts in 1979 was all about &quot;a group effort,&quot; and millions of dollars for colleges and universities serving large numbers of Hispanics benefitted from those efforts, and continue today in the millions of dollars in colleges across the U.S.  See my resume and my only Attachment 1 below, &quot;Higher Education: Coalition&#39;s work had lasting impact for Hispanics,&quot; Pueblo Chieftain, July 22, 2012.
