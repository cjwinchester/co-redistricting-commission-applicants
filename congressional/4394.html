<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I&#39;ve been politically active since the 1960s as a private citizen and for employers.  I participated in peaceful anti-war protests in the 1960s and 70s.  I&#39;ve been a vocal advocate for reproductive rights, including attending rallies and serving on the board of Colorado NARAL.  In the late 1980s I handled public relations for the E-470 authority as it pushed legislation and went to a public vote.  In the 1990s, when employed by Coors Brewing Company I advocated for passage of Colorado&#39;s environmental audit legislation.  In recent years I have been very involved in advocating for my neighborhood, which has involved contact with numerous elected officials in Jeffco and Lakewood.  Since 2014, I have volunteered for numerous election campaigns for Democratic candidates and for local issues.  From January 2017 to the start of the pandemic, I&#39;ve attended at least a dozen rallies in Denver.

 Current cycle contributions - Chris Kennedy, Libby Szabo, Diane Mitsch Bush, Jesse Danielson, Chris Kolker, Alexis King, Mark Kelly, Senate Majority PAC, Marquita Bradshaw, Abortion Access for All, Jaime Harrison, MJ Hegar, Fair Fight (GA), Jon Ossoff, and Raphael Warnock.

Previous - Morgan Carrol, Michael Bennett, Chris Kennedy, Jesse Danielson, Charley Able (Lakewood), Ramey Johnson (Lakewood), Vote Yes on 1A (Jeffco-2019)

There have been others, but my records are incomplete.  But you get the picture.

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Colorado NARAL board member 1990-1992.  Daniels Welchester Neighborhood Association (community of 1,900 homes) board member and/or advisor for the past 10+ years and currently. Association is an advocacy group, not an HOA.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
For the past 10 years, my focus has been on our neighborhood of 1,900 homes, half in Lakewood, half in unincorporated Jeffco.  I&#39;ve taken the lead on two major issues and numerous smaller ones in the past five years, researching, developing strategies and tactics, writing testimony for myself and others, and testifying and providing public comment numerous times at meetings of the Jeffco Board of Commissioners, Jeffco Planning Commission, Lakewood City Council and Lakewood Planning Commission.  Each major issue consumed well more than 100 hours of my time.  

For 2-1/2 years beginning at the start of 1990, I served on the board of Colorado NARAL, involved in various aspects of the organization.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have long believed that gerrymandering is evil and the legislative battles in Colorado over redistricting every 10 years were destructive.  It is not only unfair to the citizens in the gerrymandered districts, but the adverse impacts are incalculable, bubbling up through our political and social structures.  If congressional districts are not drawn fairly, many voters lose faith that they have a voice and stop participating.  Equally important is that those sent to Washington don’t fully represent our values as a state.  I was very happy when Colorado voters chose to follow the lead of Arizona in forming commissions.  This isn’t a silver bullet, but Colorado&#39;s new system is a good start.  And, if there is room for another old, white guy from metro Denver on the commission, I&#39;d like to help make it a success.  

I believe my skills and background make me a strong candidate.  I&#39;ve been a news junky since the 1960s (even spent time as the news director at a Vail radio station), which provides me with a built-in historical perspective of the political and social forces that have shaped Colorado for the past 40 years. I&#39;ve watched as legislative power in Colorado has shifted from rural to urban areas.  I&#39;ve lived in Colorado Springs (5 years), Eagle County (8 years), Aurora (7 years) and Jeffco (28 years), which gives me a deeper knowledge and affection for various regions of the state.  I have always been a facts/data-driven thinker and like to understand the role demographics play in local, national and international affairs.  Pre-internet, I always had a recent copy of the World Almanac and Book of Facts (google it) nearby, consulting it often to gain perspective on what was happening in the world.  And, in retirement, I have the time and energy to be a very committed member of the commission. When I commit to a cause, I&#39;m all in.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I&#39;ve always been that guy who listens to all perspectives to find consensus.  I&#39;m the one in the meeting who listens intently, asks questions and processes the information, and then proposes ways to bring together the various perspectives to develop options.  I believe everyone should have an equal voice.  If an appropriate and workable middle ground can be found and the participants are willing, I will help lead the effort to find it.  Don&#39;t get me wrong.  If I believe in something, I will advocate for it aggressively, as various, local elected officials have learned.  But, that is only after digging into the facts and hearing all perspectives. And, if my position doesn&#39;t prevail, I accept that and don&#39;t take it personally.  
I am all about fairness.  While managing PR for the vote in Adams, Arapahoe and Douglas counties to form the E-470 Public Highway Authority in the late 1980s, I (naively) proposed that, as a public entity, E-470 should provide funding to opposition groups (all environmental organizations) for them to promote their positions.  (It never happened.  Silly me.)
I have been left leaning politically my entire life and have supported and canvassed for many Democratic candidates in recent years as the state and country have become more polarized.  But, I have never joined a party because I don&#39;t want party loyalty to effect how I think and vote.  The first time I canvassed was for a Republican state senator in the 1990s because she shared my values.  Everybody has, in their minds, valid reasons for believing what they believe.  Those should be heard and respected, as long as they fall at least somewhat short of QAnon.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In my career, I never used any of the knowledge I gained as a physics major in college.  But, what made me successful in my professional life are the problem-solving skills that were drilled into my being while studying physics.  I&#39;ve succeeded in the diverse professions of public relations, software development and ,even, hotel management because strong problem-solving skills can be applied to almost any task.  My analytical approach comes down to understanding the issue, identifying the dots, then connecting them, then gathering more information and making adjustments as needed.  As a linear thinker, I am able to simplify information to the extent possible to avoid the misunderstanding and confusion that can create unnecessary conflict.
