        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Robert J. Morehouse</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Robert J. Morehouse
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Bob Morehouse</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  CEO and Founder, Vermilion Design + Digital, a full-service communications firm in Boulder with an emphasis on social impact, education and natural product clients. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I graduated high school from The Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut and graduated from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, with a degree in American Studies.  
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80304
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
From a very early age I have been interested in the American political system. My first memory of television is the 1952 GOP convention where Dwight Eisenhower was nominated. I attended the 1964 Republican Convention in San Francisco, where Barry Goldwater was nominated. I was an active volunteer in Howard Dean&#39;s 2004 presidential campaign and a member of the Dean&#39;s List. I was an early advocate for Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. Much of my political involvement has been on the local and state level, working as a volunteer for Rollie Heath&#39;s State Senate Campaigns, Steve Fenberg&#39;s State Senate Campaigns, Judy Amabile&#39;s House District 13 Campaign, and numerous City Council and County Commissioner Campaigns. I have attended Democratic party caucuses, handed out leaflets, distributed yard signs, and walked neighborhoods encouraging people to vote while answering their questions about issues and candidates. And I have donated money to many candidates and causes over the years (partial list attached.)
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
In the past five years, I have been a member of the Board of Trustees of the Colorado Chautauqua Association where I was Treasurer and Chair of the Sustainability committee; a Director of The Boulder Chamber of Commerce where I was also Co-Chair of the Community Affairs Council and the Strategic Planning Committee; a member of the Boulder County Democratic Party, the American Institute of Graphic Arts, ACLU, Human Rights Campaign, The Art Directors Club of Denver, The Denver Art Museum, The Museum of Boulder, the Shambhala Buddhist Community, The Sierra Club Indian Peaks Group, Empower Our Future; and an active volunteer with Out Boulder Country, The Community Foundation Boulder County, and the Boulder International Film Festival.  
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Over the past 40 years in Boulder I have been fortunate to be involved in many civic, cultural and for-profit organizations. As a Trustee and Board Chair of the Community Foundation Boulder County, I served on numerous committees that voted to allocate funds involving education, the arts, the environment, and LGBTQ issues. Understanding community needs was the critical task. As Co-Chair of the Community Affairs Council at the Boulder Chamber, consisting of 45 members representing a cross-section of the business community, we routinely sought out presentations on a wide range of business and community topics to guide us in making advocacy recommendations to the Board of Trustees. I am always eager to be informed and to learn more about issues before our community, and attend meetings on zoning and land use, regenerative agriculture, transportation, and renewable energy, among others. Through my business, we commit to supporting and speaking out for a wide range of nonprofit organizations such Caring for Denver Foundation, Boulder County Women&#39;s Health Center, Naturally Boulder, Boulder Museum of Contemporary Arts, Intercambio Uniting Communities, Attention Homes, and Meals on Wheels, Colorado Music Festival, and Denver Early Childhood Council, and I Have a Dream Foundation. Finally, as CEO of a 40-year-old small business, I find listening to and understanding differing views is the critical step in building a constructive consensus and decision process.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
While not perfect, the American system of democratic government is rare and precious. As we have just witnessed this year, the right to vote and the ability to hold fair elections is the cornerstone of this democracy. Voting districts should reflect changes in populations and ensure that everyone is fairly represented. It is my belief that politicians should not be able to design districts to gain partisan advantage. I voted for Amendments Y and Z in 2018 and am proud to live in a State that has removed that power and put it in the hands of an impartial panel of citizens. While I have no preconceived notions or specific experience in drawing political districts, I would consider it a privilege and a distinct challenge to serve with a group of fellow citizens to devise fair and representative voting districts. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The first step with my fellow commissioners would be to understand what we know and what we need to learn. What are best practices? What works and what doesn&#39;t? What is the competitive landscape? What about Colorado&#39;s history or geography is particularly important to this task? Hopefully we can bring in nonpartisan experts to answer our questions and provide perspectives. Once we are on the same starting page, key is listening to each other, making sure everyone communicates their views, laying out our preconceptions and biases, and slowly determining and listing essential goals and priorities that need to be met. I encourage thoughtful exchange, a careful and deliberative process, and focus on making progress. A dollop of humor greatly helps. Fairness is central to this process. I would not want to serve on a commission that is not grounded in an impartial and fair outcome. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As creative director and CEO of a 40-year old communications firm, I essentially am tasked every day with solving problems. Marketing or branding problems of our clients. Interpersonal and turf problems of my employees. Creative and positioning problems of our campaigns. Some of the problems are functional, some emotional, some intuitive, and all are complex with competing agendas. As a steward of the business for these past four decades, I have found logic and reason to be anchor points and the very ground of our decision processes.
