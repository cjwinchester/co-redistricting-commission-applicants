        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for William A. Bianco</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  William A. Bianco
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>William Anthony Bianco, Bill Bianco</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently Senior Of Counsel to the law firm of Davis, Graham &amp; Stubbs, LLP;  previously I was a partner in that law firm from the 1970s until retirement in 2014.  I will attach my most current resume.

</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a BA degree from New York University (1967) and a JD degree from Columbia University School of Law (1970).
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80207
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been a registered Democrat for many years.  I have volunteered in past campaigns for Democratic candidates primarily as a canvasser, and have been a poll watcher and an election judge in Denver on at least one occasion.  In 2020 I volunteered at my precinct caucus to be a delegate for Senator-elect John Hickenlooper.  Because of Covid 19, there was no in person county or state convention.  I was permitted to vote on line for candidates at the conventions, but to my knowledge was not actually elected as a delegate after the precinct caucus.  The office of Legislative and Legal services, in an email to my wife, told her that we were not disqualified from applying to the Commissions. To the best of my recollection and information that I have available, I have contributed to numerous Democratic candidates for office since 2015 and before.  Those candidates include:  Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, John Hickenlooper, Bill Ritter, Tom Strickland, Ken Salazar, Steny Hoyer, Joe Neguse, Jason Crow, Diana DeGette, Ed Perlmutter, David Wu, Jenna Griswold, Kaitlin Turner, Hart for CU, Sampson for State Senate, Denver Democratic Central Committee, and others.  Recent contributions to political candidates have been made through Act Blue.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
In recent years I have been involved as a board member of the Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) and a trustee of the Colorado Lawyers Trust Account Foundation (COLTAF).  My terms on DUSPA ended in May of 2017 when the Authority was disbanded upon completion of its work.  My second term on COLTAF ended in October 2015.  Since then I have been a volunteer through the Colorado Lawyers Committee and The Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network in assisting with interviews with asylum applicants, and I tried an asylum case on behalf of an applicant in January 2020.  Since that trial, because of the Covid 19 situation, I have not been actively assisting applicants.  I have for several years been a member of the Denver Chapter of Trout Unlimited and in recent months have been serving on a policy committee assisting with water quality and conservation issues.  For approximately the last 20 years, I have been a member of the Construction and Commercial Panels of Arbitrators of the American Arbitration Association and have been selected as an arbitrator in numerous cases.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have been involved as a volunteer and at times in a leadership role in a variety of organizations.  As a Democrat, in 2020, I volunteered at my precinct caucus to be a Convention delegate for Senator-elect Hickenlooper.  Because of the Covid 19 situation,  there were only virtual county and state Democratic conventions.  Essentially, by volunteering at the precinct level, I was permitted to vote in the later virtual conventions though, so far as I know, I was never formally elected after the precinct caucus.  Many years ago, I also believe I went to the county convention but do not believe that I went further.  My volunteer work for the Democratic party has primarily consisted of canvassing, and, years ago, in being a poll watcher.  I also worked at the polls for the City and County of Denver probably five to ten years ago.

I have for many years been active in organizations to provide legal services to the poor and underrepresented.  I served on the board of directors of the Legal Aid Society of Metropolitan Denver (now part of Colorado Legal Services);  I was a board member and then chair of the board of the Legal Aid Foundation of Colorado; and I was a board member  of COLTAF, which is involved in assisting in funding of legal services organizations.  I also held other offices in the latter two organizations, but don&#39;t have the details now.  I have always tried be be an advocate for the funding of legal services organizations and to broaden the base of community support for those organizations.  

Earlier in my career I was involved in legal education and admissions issue relating to the Colorado Bar.  I was a member, then chair, of the CBA Committee on Legal Education and Admissions, and later was a member and then chair of the Law Committee of the Colorado Board of Law Examiners.  In both roles, I was involved in looking into questions relating to fairness in the admissions process and issues relating to problems experienced by some members of minority communities in passing the bar exam and being admitted to the bar.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that fair representation of all citizens and the fair consideration of all votes is the foundation of democracy.  Gerrymandering may have long existed in the U.S., but it must be rejected now.  Although I do not underestimate the difficulty of the task or the time and effort that will be involved, I want to be part of the effort in Colorado to achieve fair representation.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a lawyer, mediator, and arbitrator, I have spent my career trying to resolve disputes, very often in the context of negotiation and settlement.  I learned as a litigator to always try to see disputes from the perspective of the opposing party in order to find possible paths to resolution as well as to gauge strengths and weaknesses.  As an arbitrator and mediator, I strive to set aside any possible personal preferences or prejudices and to resolve disputes on the merits.  I believe that my training and skills will carry over to the commission if I am selected. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Again, as a lawyer, mediator, and arbitrator, I have spent my career analyzing and attempting to solve complex legal and factual issues.  My litigation career at the outset required me to delve into a wide variety of problems involving different industries and technical issues, as well as legal issues.  In the past few years, I have been primarily an arbitrator.  I have had to apply analytical skills to impartially resolve complex and difficult legal and factual disputes.
