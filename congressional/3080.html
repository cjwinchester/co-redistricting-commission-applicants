<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have volunteered for Misty Plowright&#39;s Campaign in 2016 for CD5.
I have worked for the El Paso County Dem&#39;s to help them organize the 2018 County assembly and the 2020 County Assembly and Convention, which became digital 2 weeks before the start date.

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Member of the El Paso County Democratic Party, as a PCP, leader of the El Paso County Permanent Org, member of the state Permanent Org, and a member of several vacancy committees.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I led the team that organized the El Paso County Assembly of 2018, that was heralded as one of the most efficient and well-run Assemblies that our candidates had attended.  Our team’s work on the assembly was noticed and publicly commented on by Jared Polis, Jena Griswold, and Joe Salazar. I then lead the team organizing the 2020 Convention and Assembly. We had everything set up, and then reorganized the whole thing to run online due to COVID with only about 2 weeks to go.  A local reporter that had attended several Conventions told us how exceptional our online event was compared to the rest.  Organizing these large events you have to think about all the groups and organizations that will be there, and give them equal and fair representation, with such considerations as speaking order, table location, how much time everyone gets, etc.  We always had our meetings attended and made information accessible upon request about how we chose everything.  We asked people from different walks of life to attend an online seminar and before that we checked with people with varied level of technical skill to see what we could do to make it easier for them to access the event. We listened to their concerns and made modifications for accessibility, and then provided training sessions to people for the days before the event so they would be familiar with the technology. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am a Democrat in El Paso County, the big red district here in Colorado.  Previous to being a Democrat, I was Independent.  I have watched the local Republicans redraw districts that were about to turn blue so that they had no chance in the future. Gerrymandering does not help the people to feel that they have a voice.  In this troubling time above all else, we need to have a voice that really represents the people, and the districts have been drawn to make that impossible in my location.  I know this can happen through all of Colorado, and I am interested in making it fair, and representative of the people who live in the districts.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
With my Previous work on the El Paso County Conventions and Assembly, we had as diverse a team as possible to organize the event.  The team had very different points of view, and the goal of every event was to have everyone feel heard, and that their issues were being addressed within the rules of running the event. While many of the conversations could get a little heated, I was able to redirect the team efforts to that of inclusivity, impartiality, and fairness.  Speaking orders for candidates did not favor anyone but was randomly chosen.  Table arrangements were also made the same way.  All our pricing for tables was as inclusive as possible, keeping everything within the reach of candidates and organizations.  When anyone started to go strongly to their “side” of things, I would bring the conversation back to how our organization was there to be impartial, and we would get back on task. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I worked for Hewlett Packard Enterprise for almost 15 years, and during a large portion of that time, I was a business analysist, I worked in reporting and analyzing big data to generate our statistics and to provide our customers with a picture of the activity of their company’s data.  I am currently pursuing a degree in Applied Mathematics.  Mathematics, and data tell a story of a situation, and the data from the redistricting should be analyzed to see the stories of the communities, towns, of the people that it represents.
