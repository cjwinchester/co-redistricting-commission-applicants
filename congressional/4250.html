        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Barbara Diane Morton</h3>

</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>

</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80134
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I served as Student Dean of Multicultural Affairs at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs. I participated in a student constitutional committee as well as in the informational sessions regarding new facilities on campus.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have volunteered for the Alzheimers Association and the Multiple Sclerosis Society.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
While working for El Paso County Department of Human Services, I managed financial/food/medical assistance cases for disabled individuals. I worked with them on the Social Security application process and helped them locate community assistance resources as needed. I actively worked to increase the awareness of the needs and challenges of the disabled population within the county offices as well as in the community.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Political views have greatly polarized the citizens of Colorado and the United States as a whole. When one party or point of view dominates a district, people with a different viewpoint often feel that their voices are not heard and their needs are unrecognized. When a district is more balanced, candidates may be more inclined to find common ground with all constituents, leading to solutions that serve the majority of the district&#39;s citizens. I still remember hearing about gerrymandering as a child in school and being appalled by the concept even then. As an adult, I would love to serve on the commission and actively take part in the fight against gerrymandering. It is an opportunity to have a positive impact on our State that will hopefully help guide future commissions and generations toward government representation that serves all of us.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
It is important to listen to different viewpoints before making a decision, and I do not expect other commissioners to always agree with my viewpoint. I will hear what others have to say and, when appropriate, offer suggestions for a compromise that will allow everyone to feel that their ideas are valid and useful. I spent more than eight years providing assistance to individuals and families in need through the Department of Human Services. It was my job to administer the programs uniformly according to the regulations regardless of how I personally felt about individuals or their circumstances. When serving on a committee or commission, I separate the people from the ideas, including my own, so that I can evaluate them objectively. I try to see both the details and the bigger picture and evaluate ideas objectively according to their impact on each.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have worked with software development staff creating and updating various applications to ensure that relevant rules are incorporated into the system. This included testing a complex report tracking invoices and payments in which various transactions could be applied and ensuring that the correct result was provided in all possible combinations. With the Department of Human Services, it was often necessary to review various rules in connection with a family&#39;s specific circumstances. In unusual situations, one rule might apply to some aspects of the situation, while another rule spoke more clearly to different aspects. I frequently served as a resource to other technicians, ensuring that all rules were considered and the results matched the needs.
