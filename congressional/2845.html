        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Lynn C. Hartfield</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Lynn C. Hartfield
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Lynn Hartfield</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am an attorney, and own my own firm, the Law Office of Lynn C. Hartfield, LLC. I am also of counsel at the Eichner Law Firm.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I received my bachelor&#39;s degree from Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts in 1985, and my J.D., with honors, from the University of Chicago Law School in 1991.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80206
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I assisted the Democratic Party with voter registration in the 2016 election, and also did door knocking on behalf of Hillary Clinton in 2016. In 2018, I wrote postcards and knocked doors for CO 6 Congressional Candidate Jason Crow. For the 2020 election, I did several shifts on the Wisconsin Voter Protection Hotline. During the 2020 election season,  I donated money to the following: Kamala Harris for President; Pete Buttigieg for President; Vote Save America&#39;s senate fund; Alaska U.S. Senate candidate Al Gross, a college classmate of mine; Stacey Abrahms&#39; Fair Fight Action Committee, and an organization coordinating food trucks to serve food to people waiting in line at polls in several states.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Sam Cary Bar Association
Colorado Women&#39;s Bar Association
Morey Middle School Parent Board (2013-2016)
East High School Equity Angels (2018-19)
East High School Con Law Scholars Volunteer Judge (2018-present)
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have spent my career representing indigent criminal defendants, both in trial courts and courts of appeal, including the Colorado Supreme Court. I am passionate about ensuring that everyone has equal access to the best representation, regardless of their personal circumstances. Outside of my work as an attorney, I have worked with local schools, including Morey Middle School and East High School, to help ensure that students have equal access to the best education possible. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
With each successive election, more and more questions are raised about whether our system is truly representative. I am proud that Colorado has turned redistricting over to an independent commission that will receive input from a diverse group, rather than turning this important task over to political actors. I believe we can be a model for other states to adopt, and I would be honored to take on a leadership role in this endeavor.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As an attorney, I have spent my career persuading disparate parties to come to an agreement. The vast majority of federal criminal cases resolve by agreement, not trial, and much of my work has involved coming to a consensus with prosecutors and probation officers about the appropriate disposition for a given case. I have achieved this through thorough investigation and research, and putting together an organized presentation that acknowledges the other side&#39;s interests but is firm in advocating for my client&#39;s interests. In my experience, the key to reaching consensus is to make sure that I have done my homework and know the issues in depth, but also to be respectful of, and listen to, the positions of each person with a stake. Reaching consensus involves being willing to give when appropriate, but holding firm when facts and data support your position.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My work as an attorney involves analysis and application of logic to problems on a daily basis. When clients walk into my office with a legal problem, they don&#39;t know how the law applies to their situation; they only know they need help. My job is to determine the relevant area of law, find the relevant statutes and case law, and apply them to the client&#39;s particular situation. This requires taking a sometimes unwieldy and unorganized narrative, distilling the relevant facts, and organizing the facts and law into a presentation that demonstrates how the two fit together. I am by nature a logical thinker (which is probably why I was drawn to the law!), and take an analytical approach to problem-solving in both my work and personal life.
