<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have followed public affairs and voted consistently throughout my adult life (60 yrs). I moved to Colorado in 1980 to take the position of State Demographer in the Dept. of Local Affairs. I left this position in 1994 when I transferred to the Dept. of Health Care Policy and Financing where I worked as a statistical and budget analyst. I retired from state government in 2003. During my 23 years in state government I was not active in partisan politics. Following retirement from state government I held a number of part-time and full-time positions in the health care field. I also served on volunteer boards and became more politically active. In 2012 I did door-to-door canvasing for the Obama campaign; in 2018 I did the same for Jason Crow&#39;s campaign. I have donated modest sums to recent political campaigns.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Though I am a registered Democrat, I have not held and office with the party. Four years ago I became active in our neighborhood organization. I have served as president of the Old San Rafael (Registered) Neighborhood Organization for the past 3 years. For the last four years I have been active in the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at the University of Denver. From 2003 to 2006 I was a member of the board of the Brain Injury Association of Colorado.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Since retiring from state government I have been an actively engaged citizen. However, this engagement has generally not consisted of &quot;organizing, representing or advocating...&quot; partisan organizations.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
During my tenure as State Demographer I played a minor role in the post-1980 and post-1990 reapportionments of the state legislature. I believe my expertise in demography and my familiarity with the demographic, geographic and political diversity of Colorado would be an asset to the Commission. I also believe that reducing partisan considerations in creating legislative districts would enhance our representative democracy.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my work for CO state government, various health care organizations and in my volunteer work I have striven to create consensus among people with different personalities, backgrounds and points of view (political, professional and personal). Consensus is not always possible but respectful disagreement should be. If chosen for the Commission I will strive for consensus. When that is not possible I will respect both majority and minority points of view and work toward an acceptable compromise.
Two episodes of my professional career are relevant in this regard. 
•	From 1992 to 1995 I was director of the Colorado Health Data Commission. This nine-member, governor-appointed commission (representing different political parties and different segments of the health care sector) was charged with producing objective data on the cost and quality of inpatient care in large hospitals in the state. For my success in managing this highly charged process I was honored as State Manager of the Year in 1993.
•	While serving as a rates analyst in the Dept. of Health Care Policy and Financing in 1998-99 I facilitated meetings with representatives of insurance companies that were contracting with the department for Medicaid managed care plans. The rates the state paid (taxpayer money) constituted an important revenue stream for the contracting plans. Managing discussions about complicated actuarial issues was a real challenge. I believe I rose to the occasion.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My academic training in economics, sociology and demography provided the background for a professional career that included undergraduate teaching (sociology), public service (Colorado State Demographer, Medicaid statistical and budget analyst) and post-state government employment (program evaluation research). Statistical analysis and explaining the results of my analyses to diverse audiences has been a common thread throughout my professional career. Good (though often not perfect) data, properly analyzed can be the foundation for sound decisions. Equally important is understanding that numbers alone are seldom sufficient. Many non-quantifiable factors come into play when identifying “communities of interest” and “fair districts”. If selected, I think I can play a key role in communicating with commission staff, fellow commissioners and the public who will be watching our work.
