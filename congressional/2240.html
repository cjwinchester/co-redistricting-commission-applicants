</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Board of Directors for The United Nations Association of Boulder County Trained at a national level to facilitate understanding across, local, national, and international boundaries, while organizing people and events to aid with this understanding. Front Range Community College (FRCC) Student Government Association The State Student Advisory Council Representative Legislative Liaison for the Colorado Community College System Student Advisor to the Colorado Commission of Higher Education President, FRCC Business Club Member National Society Leadership and Success Vice President Phi Theta Kappa (PTK) Honor Society University of Colorado, Boulder: Student Advisor to the Colorado Commission of Higher Education Officer—Non-Traditional Student Organization CU in DC Internship Program Boulder County Democratic Party Area Coordinator Boulder County Democratic Party—“Get Out The Vote” 2011-2015 Caucus Super Site Chair, Co-Chair and Precinct Caucus Leader 2010-2020 Organizer/Precinct Leader 2010-2020 I was an elected member to the Boulder Valley School District’s (BVSD) Accountability and the Accreditation Committees as well as being co-chair to two BVSD school consolidation transition teams. This latter position involved one elementary and one middle school. Because nothing sparks more passion than our children, there was potential for acrimony in this process, therefore in depth consideration to all points of view was required, as it was with my chairmanship of House District 13 (HD13). House District 13 encompasses 5 counties: Boulder, Gilpin, Clear Creek, Grand and Jackson. Because of the wide variety of interests, issues, demographics, and geography, of HD 13 as Chair to HD 13 for the Colorado Democratic Central Committee, I took seriously my charge to ensure that the voices of all constituents be heard. Managing these groups successfully was a tremendous opportunity learn and lead.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am a fervent believer in collaboration, inclusiveness, and honesty to address issues that affect our communities. The practices of inclusivity, respect, and collaboration lead to healthy communities while helping to alleviate feelings of disparity or neglect. I am a lifelong learner with a passion to understand different cultures, and identities steering me to many leadership positions in Colorado. I am a person who seeks and values new experiences including discovering for our commonalities. I have lived in Colorado for the majority of my life. My adult daughters were all born, reared, and educated in Colorado schools K-12 through University. I believe in Colorado and Coloradans.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
First and foremost, I am a Coloradan. I am an recognized leader with proven skills for bringing people together. I have witnessed that when encouraged and given the tools, people set aside personal differences and work together for their common interest, towards what is inherently best for not only themselves but the community at large. In respect to this I will again refer to two of my in organizing and unifying. Those with the BVSD and House District 13.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In deciphering an issue, it is helpful when I look at issues in smaller pieces, pulling out emotion while examining and using evidence-based information to facilitate decisions. I identify potential problem issues then use research, critical thinking, and effective communication to resolve the problem.
