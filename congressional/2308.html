<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Though I have been quite active on many parent boards and organizations over the past 10 years, my most significant contribution was to the CCA Foundation. I served on the 5-member board of the Cherry Creek Academy Foundation about 6 years ago. We made financial decisions for school upgrades and equipment based on the needs of the school, desire of the parents and the budget. We carefully reviewed the results of parent surveys to address the greatest needs impacting the greatest number of students. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated to the Colorado Children&#39;s Campaign in recent years. This organization advocates for legislation to support education for children  in Colorado. I did purchase a book and hat from Dan Crenshaw, which may have been considered a contribution to his campaign for Congress in Texas this year.

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
none
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
It is essential that this commission include the perspective of the average Colorado mother who is not tied to one political party or the other. Most of us in Colorado are moderate and the people of Colorado deserve someone like myself who will stand nothing to gain from redistricting except the opportunity to serve her community. It came to my attention recently that this work needs to be done. I have been considering ways that I can serve my community and this seems like the right way to use my energy.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a long time practitioner of yoga and meditation, I strive to find a state of equanimity in everything. I do not get attached to candidates, elections or the outcomes. I simply live my life to the best of my ability. This has been an extraordinary year to listen to people with conservative and liberal ideologies and to look for the ways we can connect and support each other. I tend to be a mediator. I know that independent of your political allegiance, deep down as humans we all have the same basic desires, we simply have different ideas about the right path. We are complex and our conversations should be nuanced. Politics should not be &quot;us versus them&quot; but rather, we should always be seeking ways to find common ground and working together to accomplish great feats. I frequently have conversations with people who I may not agree with, but my mindset is to seek for understanding.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a teacher and mother, I am constantly challenged to analyze and strategize. When I am faced with a difficult decision, I often seek mentors, have conversations about it and also take alone time to reflect and analyze. I know that better decisions are made from a place of care and grace and I strive to be in that place. My meditation practice allows me to reset and refocus myself on a task when stuck. This practices also allows me to engage in critical thinking because of the impact on the parasympathetic nervous system. Overall, I would say anybody who knows me would agree that I am reasonable, logical and level-headed. I will seek to understand all sides of an issue to unite people.
