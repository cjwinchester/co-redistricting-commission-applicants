<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I was an active supporter of this new commission and form of redistricting, reapportionment for our State as passed by the voters - with the hope that this would be a more fair and equitable process.  I have testified on previous commissions when the decision has ended up in our Courts.  As our State and in particular my County grows I would like to see less contrived Districts and additional representation that is needed to be drawn fairly.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My reputation is as a skilled, fair, hard working community builder.   In building community, representing the under represented my goal and my history is to always try to put the whole vs. the fractured in front without compromising important community values.  As my Resume&#39; illustrates I have a great deal of experience building teams and consensus.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
While I have a strongly held set of values I am perceptive at recognizing others may have a different opinion, value and it is important not only to project but, to listen as well.  It is incumbent on me to educate myself on all possibilities and to apply logic vs. emotion to coming up with a solution.
