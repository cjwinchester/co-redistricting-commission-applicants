        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Joseph Robert Hildebrand</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Joseph Robert Hildebrand
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Generally known as J.R. Hildebrand</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Currently Semi-retired.  Owner of J.R. Hildebrand and Associates since 1970.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  4+ years at BYU, Provo, UT. Courses of study: Zoology, Chemistry, Business Administration and Photography.
50 years of continuous study of corporate and human resource law, international trade codes and relations, logistics and financial management on all levels. Self taught computer and cyber security skills. Because of numerous and frequent high security requirements, I have maintained a very low profile. 
While I do not have degrees or certificates of achievement, I have a lifetime of visible success, especially working with and leading others. The numerous letters of recommendation I have from past associates and employees tell the story. Anyone 25 years old or older has seen some of my creativity on TV. Bottomline: I am an incurable entrepreneurial workaholic with a high level of personal integrity that has sometimes cost me millions- but I sleep well.

</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80642-7934
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
1. GOP  campaigns 2016 and 2020
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
None
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I attended one 20 minute GOP Caucus organizational meeting in 2015 and promptly withdrew. I was unable to honestly commit to the level of time and energy needed to do the job right during that time. I was very busy with business endeavors that required an inordinate amount of time and energy. I do not make commitments that I know I cannot honor in a responsible and reliable manner.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am a semi-retired Septuagenarian with a broad base of skills and understanding honed by a lifetime of success and failures. I know the brutal losses of life (widower plus other close loss of life). I know the pain of loss of deep financial crisis. I am the patriarch of a bi-racial family that includes adoptions and special needs children. 

Because of my life experiences, I can relate to people, and when I listen to them, I learn. When I learn, I can apply understanding and reasoning to problem identification and resolution. Our fast growing and diverse populace will require careful planning based on real needs and real expectations for positive growth. Representation of our brothers and sisters in our nations capital requires that it be truly representative so that every voice is heard. 

Every legal citizen deserved the comfort of knowing that they are represented by the best and most trusted of their neighbors’. That trust begins at the base level. As a commissioner I will be prepared to make sure that their trust is met with integrity and intelligent leadership as the commission strives to accomplish redistricting in a fair and efficient manner. I am a forward thinker. As such I firmly believe that those charged with the responsibility of planning must do so with an unbridled level of researching the past to help match current growth to what could be in the bigger picture. That means there is no place for personal agenda but rather an open mind to what could be as a benefit for all. Now is not the time to be bashful but to be confident. That said, in addition to my heart-felt and deep desire to serve the community, I believe the commission needs my proven skills and leadership. It is definitely time again for me to be giving back.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In addition to my statement above, I know and have cultivated and demonstrated a particular ability to listen. While I am confident, there is no ego. In the past I used to have weekly, secure and private meetings with key staff (often 20 to 40 people, men and women). First, anyone with a gripe with the boss (me) had an open floor and the opportunity to voice their opinion or concern. Others would be required to listen without interruption. When that person had completed their comments, I asked questions, mostly about how I could improve and what I could do to help them. We then had an open forum about the issue and arrived at solutions. The same process was repeated around the room. Sometimes workers had grievances with each other and that is the time we used to get those sorted out. In conclusion of the meeting, we had arrived at mutually acceptable solutions. However, because my name was on the line, I would make the final decision, especially on who would do what and then stand behind it. If a change succeeded, the persons initiating it got the proper recognition, but if it failed I would graciously accept the responsibility, having been the final say in the first place. I believe the most important part of this process is my ability and willingness to listen, yield and compromise as necessary but to also stand my ground when required. This system has been used repeatedly for decades and works wonders with any project and group of people.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
 I have a lifetime of computer skills, generating comparison scenarios and running “Ben Franklin” pro’s and cons. Doing so requires an understanding that there is not one size of anything that fits everyone. Like shoes and a good suit, good planning and decisions require a good tailor.

Fifty years ago I read a book titled “Idea Tracking” written by management consultant and educator/author, Peter Drucker. Drucker has been known in established business culture as the founder of modern management concepts.  The gist of the narrative is that one must research everything you can about an issue and the put it out of your mind for an hour or perhaps days or even a week or two if time permits. The point is that having done the research and letting your brain do the sorting, the answers being sought will suddenly make themselves very evident. That is when we have the often referred to “epiphany.” After putting that to the test, it is a staple of my life and I teach that principle everywhere I have an opportunity.

I have been responsible for millions of dollars and thousands of people and know the pressure to meet their management requirements. I know the depth of being responsible for the lives of those who have trusted my leadership. Having a master plan with plans B, C and D behind it for unknown contingencies has been my lifetime mantra. The driving force there is asking valid questions and then patiently LISTENING to the answers with an OPEN MIND. There is nothing wrong with changing ones opinion or even making a 180 degree turn-about when presented with enough valid information with which to adjust. In my past, not being able to do so may have been beyond costly. I have personal loathing of mistakes being made because there was not enough research extended toward understanding the possible long-term outcome of any decision. 

In service with the commission I would be bringing a presence and depth of mature, quiet and confident participation.
