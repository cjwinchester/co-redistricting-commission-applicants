<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I was a State Representative from 2007-2010 for HD56 which then incorporated Summit Lake and Eagle Counties. Mine was a competitive district almost evenly divided between Republican, Democrat and Unaffiliated voters and I worked hard to serve in bi-partisan manner at the State Capitol and to meet the interests of my diverse district.  I then served as Governor John Hickenlooper&#39;s Legislative Director his first term in office.  The Governor tasked my office with working to find bipartisan agreements to the majority of legislative priorities the Governor&#39;s office was supporting.  As a result, I would often convene legislators of both parties together to forge compromise agreements on a myriad of bills.  At Keystone Policy Center, a nonprofit organization I lead - our mission is grounded in the belief that when you bring together a diversity of stakeholders to tackle tough policy issues the negotiated agreements that are produced represent lasting and sustainable solutions.  Our work is bipartisan or nonpartisan in nature and addresses policy issues in health, environment, energy, education and tribal affairs; we have a 45-year history of impact at the local, state and national levels. Our mission statement is to help leaders rise above entrenched positions to reach common higher ground - which I think translates directly into supporting the work of the commission.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe strongly in the value of competitive and/or balance in congressional and state districts.  I think the state better represents the interests of its citizens and democracy is best served when people feel their vote matters and that their voice and interests will be heard. This aspiration will best be met when the state has achieved the goals of the commission&#39;s work.  Also, being from the Western Slope I hope to bring a different geographical perspective to the commission.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe strongly in collaborative leadership and the power of consensus among diverse interests, but you much work to elevate negotiations above least-common denominator decision-making to be impactful.  I am trained in facilitation and negotiation and all of my work experiences have leant themselves to furthering those skills.  I will work hard to be both fair and impartial and have found that most efforts of this sort are grounded in building some level of respect and trust as a collective group.  All negotiations are in-part relational meeting people where they are but recognizing differences.  These values are part of my work everyday.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
At my organization - Keystone Policy Center, we ground all of our multi-stakeholder dialogues in science,data and a shared understanding of the policy drivers and implications related to possible outputs from our processes.   I have practiced the analytical and logic skills necessary for effective negotiation and compromise for my professional career - both in public service and in my work in the nonprofit sector.
