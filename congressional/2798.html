        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Alise Beikmann</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Alise Beikmann
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a water resources engineer at Dewberry Engineers, Inc. I have previously worked as a civil engineer at Lamp Rynearson and HDR, and as a graduate research assistant as Colorado State University.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a B.S. in Civil Engineering from the University of Michigan and a M.S. in Civil Engineering from Colorado State University. I&#39;m a registered professional engineer in the State of Colorado. Much of my work if for local municipalities&#39; public works or water departments, as well as the Mile High Flood District. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80224
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I participated in the last democratic caucus as the precinct captain for Hillary Clinton in 2016, for my local precinct in Fort Collins (I lived there at the time). I have since made small donations to Hillary Clinton&#39;s 2016 campaign and Elizabeth Warren&#39;s 2020 campaign. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am a member of the democratic party and a member of CASFM (Colorado Association of Stormwater and Floodplain Managers).
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Aside from campaigning for Hillary in 2016 (canvassing, phone banking, etc.), my involvement in organizing and social advocacy has been limited to occasionally attending marches for women&#39;s rights, black lives matter, and science, as well as making small monetary contributions to these causes. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I see a lot of opportunity for the political system to become less polarizing and more science/numbers based. I love consulting in the engineering field and understand the priorities of people from different backgrounds. I think people are generally fair and understanding when presented with good information - and my experience could translate well to this type of discussion. And finally, I would like people to have greater confidence that the system above them considers them equal to folks across town, and confidence that we&#39;re using the best/latest census information available to keep the system relevant.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I&#39;ve been the consulting engineer in several meetings with several stakeholders, and I understand the need for direct goals/action items at every meeting. If data points a certain way/makes an alternative a more logical choice, I don&#39;t hesitate to put that information forth while allowing others to share their concerns (since they sometimes may not have been thought of). In the end, I think with the right information and communication, there&#39;s always a way to come out with a resolution that meets the needs of different groups. And since it&#39;s often only my technical opinion that matters in these types of discussions, I consider myself well-versed in the skill of remaining fair and impartial. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
While my work doesn&#39;t deal with political boundaries/voting precinct alignments, I often use census data and jurisdictional boundaries for the work I do. Census data and growth rates helps project future water demands/sewer flow rates for our infrastructure and I have worked closely with that information and local data from agencies. Also, since my recent work is in Major Drainageway Planning and the watersheds we provide planning information for often overlap several local jurisdictions, I&#39;m aware of when to bring in stakeholders for their input and consider their additional thoughts as part of the overall discussion. And basically, I&#39;m very used to staring at maps of metro-Denver.
