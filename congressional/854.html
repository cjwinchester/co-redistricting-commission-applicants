        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Lori Smith Schell</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Lori Smith Schell
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a self-employed energy economist based in Durango, doing business as Empowered Energy (www.EmpoweredEnergy.com) since August 2002.  As seen in my attached resume, I specialize in the markets for renewables, natural gas, power, and emissions.  I am a &quot;numbers guy&quot; who has built my professional reputation on providing objective, unbiased analyses.  I perform independent, detailed economic analyses of emerging technologies and energy markets in support of the most efficient and least cost transformation of the electric grid.  My endgame is to arm decision makers with objective, defensible numbers they can rely on to make well-informed policy.  I will manage my project-based workload to make the significant time commitment necessary to serve on this commission.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I hold a Ph.D. in Mineral Economics and Operations Research from The Pennsylvania State University.  My bachelor&#39;s degree is in Economics (Honors) from The University of Washington.  I am an Energy Risk Professional (&quot;ERP&quot;), certified by the Global Association of Risk Professionals (&quot;GARP&quot;).  I am currently preparing to take the exam for GARP&#39;s certificate in Sustainability and Climate Risk (&quot;SCR&quot;).
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81303
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
As a life-long unaffiliated voter, I have generally avoided partisan political activity.  I was honored to be interviewed for a seat on the Colorado Public Utilities Commission in 2015.  I ran for a position on the deeply divided La Plata Electric Association (&quot;LPEA&quot;) Board of Directors in 2016 &quot;to encourage real dialogue to find areas of agreement or compromise&quot; but was defeated.  (See attached LPEA personal statement.)  I attend local voter information sessions (e.g., sponsored by the League of Women&#39;s Voters), consider myself an informed voter, and take the right to vote very seriously.  Our joint marital donations to campaigns or other political organizations since November 10, 2015, have primarily been to personal friends and include: (1) LPEA Board of Directors Campaign (2016-2018, 2020, through San Juan Citizen&#39;s Alliance); (2) Barbara McLachlan, Colorado State Representative, District 59 (2016); Lyda Ruyter, Town Council, Stamford, CT (2017); La Plata County Democrats (2019); Amy Klobuchar, U.S. President (2020).
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
(1)  International Association for Energy Economics - VP-Communications (2015-2016); Council Member (2013).
(2)  U.S. Association for Energy Economics - Senior Fellow; Past President (2013); Council Member (2008-2014).
(3)  Global Association of Risk Professionals - Certified Energy Risk Professional (2013)
(4)  Leadership La Plata - Curriculum Committee (Multiple Years)
(5)  Four Corners Geological Society
(6)  Women&#39;s Resource Center
(7)  Durango Chamber of Commerce (through 12/2019)
(8)  American Association of Petroleum Geologists (through 6/2019)
(9)  Municipal Sustainability Energy Forum (8/18-10/19)
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
(1)  I served as a Board member of Pagosa Verde, LLC, from 2014-2020.  This Pagosa Springs-based geothermal development company was dissolved in 2020 after many years of trying to promote geothermal projects for electricity generation or direct use in Colorado.
(2)  I have been active in Leadership La Plata since 2004, promoting local leadership development by participating in numerous strategic planning focus groups, coordinating several events for my Class of 2004-2005 classmates every year, and serving on the Curriculum Committee for multiple years.
(3)  With me being the sole breadwinner in the family, most of our family&#39;s civic duty has been taken up by my stay-at-home-dad husband, who served on the Durango 9-R School Board for 8 years, volunteers at the local Volunteers of America safe house, and is currently our HOA President.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am a non-partisan, unaffiliated voter, deeply troubled by the growing political divisions in our local, state, and national communities.  I tend to analyze issues with a critical eye, which has limited my ability to &quot;take sides&quot; and allowed me to try to build bridges between competing interests.  The perverse impacts on our democratic institutions brought about by the distorted results of gerrymandering is of great concern to me.  I would bring a balanced outlook and deeply analytical mind in service to this commission.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My natural tendency is to see both sides of an issue, one reason that I have never been willing to affiliate with a political party.  I try to reconcile different viewpoints and build consensus by being sensitive to group dynamics; I strive to ensure that each individual has a chance to be heard and feel valued in a group setting.  I found this practice particularly important as President of the U.S. Association for Energy Economics and would apply the same principles as a commissioner.  I have no hidden agenda or axe to grind, which I believe will enable me to be fair and impartial.  My objective is to advocate for redrawing voting district lines that would strengthen democratic representation to the benefit of all Coloradans.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am a consummate &quot;numbers guy&quot; who has applied my analytical operations research training to projects throughout my nearly 35-year career.  I am highly computer literate, fluent in Microsoft Excel and Access, and providing economics-related coding in MATLAB.  My early quantification of rooftop solar photovoltaic attributes is widely attributed as moving the California Public Utility Commission forward in providing $2.1 billion in incentives under the California Solar Initiative.  My past expert witness work has required me to organize, analyze, and draw conclusions from huge transaction-related data sets covering multiple years.  I am not intimidated by challenging problems, particularly when the results are as important as those addressed by this commission.
