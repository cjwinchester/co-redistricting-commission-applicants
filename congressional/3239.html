<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I was limited in political activity because prior to entering the private practice of law I was a federal employee.  Even thereafter, my law firm, Williams &amp; Rhodes LLP holds federal government contracts thereby limiting any donation to candidates for federal election.  

This year, I volunteered my time and worked as caller for the Democratic Party&#39;s phone bank.

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
The last twenty-two years of my law practice have focused on the advocacy for the rights of federal employees who believe they have been discriminated against.   I have tried and won or resolved cases for numerous women who suffered sexual harassment in the workplace, an HIV positive male who worked for the US Army in Colorado Springs, an African-American USPS worker, a white male at the end of his career for a federal scientific agency in Boulder, a female cancer survivor and the only woman on a Denver-based senior management team, to name just a few.     

Not only did I listen to and advocate for those without a voice in the federal workplace, I participated in the leadership of the Colorado Plaintiff&#39;s Employment Law Association for many years.  This organization promotes and increases public awareness of employee rights and provides educational opportunities, information and assistance to attorneys who represent employees.  The most recent success of Colorado PELA was advocacy for Proposition 118, Paid Family and Medical Leave which the voters approved on November 3, 2020.       
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As I contemplate the end of my legal career, I long to return to community service.  I ended my term as a Hearing Officer for the Denver Civil Service Commission in 2012.  For five years, I heard cases of Denver police officers disciplinary  appeals either as a sole officer or a panel member.  We should all serve a greater cause and sitting on this commission would provide me the opportunity to give back and assure those often without a voice are represented.    
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As I said, I served as a Denver Civil Service Commission Hearing Officer often as a panel member.  Likewise I served on arbitration panels for the National Association of Security Dealers, now FINRA.  Therefore, I have often heard evidence with two others and then come to a consensus on disputed matters of police discipline and security claims.  In all my years hearing these far different types of cases, I do not recall any split decisions on panels on which I served. 

I have also mediated numerous cases to settlements for clients I represented.  No doubt in mediation, finding the middle ground between parties while not discounting the value of my client&#39;s case will serve me well as a member of the commission.  I once heard a mediator say that if both parties feel they have given up too much, perhaps the settlement was a good one.  I have relied on that statement many times.  

Finally, I have since 1999, worked as an independent contract for some federal agencies investigating over 100 claims of workplace discrimination.  In each of these claims I review initial stated claims with supporting documents, select and then interview relevant witnesses, and gather other documentary evidence to compile a report for a decision maker.  This work requires me to be fair to both sides, the claimant and the agency, and make no statement as to the validity of the claims.  Accordingly, I have honed my skills in fairness and impartiality.     
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have practiced law now for some 33 years and tried numerous cases.  Accordingly, my ability to apply logic and reason to difficult problems has served me well.  From an initial consultation with a prospective client, I have analyzed the events the person described, reviewed documents, and had to make a determination whether not only if the person has a claim, but also whether the claim was one in which an administrative body or a court would award damages.  Accordingly, problem solving has been the ultimate goal in my litigation practice.
