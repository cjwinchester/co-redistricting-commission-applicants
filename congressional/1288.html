<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The fine people of the state of Colorado have spoken!  By voting in favor of this redistricting process,  Colorado committed to fairness. That commitment is reflected in the formulation of these independent committees.  Politics are messy business these days.  It is well understood that how districts are designated has a big outcome on election results. I want this contribute to the betterment of our state, and of voting in general.  Through this representative process, Colorado may well become a national model on how to put an end to gerrymandering. THe country needs to know us to provide this model.  
I am a &quot;regular&quot; person.  I have gotten to know a lot about the state through my volunteerism, my work with school districts throughout Colorado, and as someone who loves exploring great landscapes and hiking trails. I am a dedicated and committed person.  Fairness in elections is paramount, and this process will have my full attention. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The name of my consulting company is Concurrence Consulting.  Concurrence is about achieving agreement among stakeholders.  I am particularly skilled at hearing all sides of an issue, and being able to appreciate the different points of view.   I have deep experience  working with groups to further understanding and to be able to move forward on issues or projects. I am a skilled and trained facilitator. I am comfortable working with a variety of personalities with a variety of interests. I can also spot what is getting in the way of a group reaching its goal, and can work effectively to remove those obstacles.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
 I have a masters in business administration.  Much of that coursework is quantitative and qualitative analysis. In graduate school, I excelled at understanding case studies. In my own work as a consultant I must quickly absorb and analyze information to correctly identify obstacles and see areas for improvement. I am able to quickly synthesis information and articulate it for others to get on board.. I am able to see what is working and not working. I can be dispassionate when surrounded by high emotion. I keep a clear eye on the stated goal and help to keep people focused on relevant issues.
