</p>

  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently a Loadmaster at a Chrysler Corporation Warehouse.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I am a Graduate Of Miami University in Ohio. I was a Double Major in Social Work and the Humanities(Comparative Religion). This educational background has allowed to see things acutely, at the community and local levels and understand the needs of the people, with empathy and with clear solutions.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80010
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I have a great knack for organizing, and creating harmony and results in the process. Sometimes its like not having a recipe to cook from, but having rich ingredients , all the same. I know where to put which spice, and how long to simmer, and &#39;viola!, we all have a great, but trying day. The work is done and we are fulfilled... until the next time. With my company FCA, we have committed ourselves to community engagement, and at any chance possible, I try to do this on my free time, here all across Colorado. And let me just say, the beauty of the state make it all that much easier.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
As a child, my parents were active in the community and local government. They taught me and my siblings the importance of our vote. and of doing our parts to be good citizens. At 16, I was a volunteer at the Cincinnati HQ for the Clinton campaign in 1992. Not even old enough to vote yet, I still felt like my canvassing and phone bank calls to voters made a difference. I have been active with my local party for every election since. Be it Registering people to vote, to giving classes on local measures, I believe that it is my civic duty to inform. I have remained neutral and haven&#39;t giving to any campaign or organization.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Colorado Democratic Party. Michigan Democratic Party. Cincinnati Civic Garden Club.
Alpha Sigma Phi Fraternity
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that I will be a great asset and addition to the Redistricting Commission, because I have a love for fairness and equality. My focuses in university allowed me to be diverse in my approach to serving the public, while understanding the role of Government, and how to make it all work together. My experience in management has allowed me to experience working under pressure and meeting deadlines. And having being an Educator I understand that everything we will do will be to the benefit of the future, and the legacy passed on to generations down the road. Being part of this Commission, I will bear all of this in mind.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Whether it is stated, or not, we as Commissioners will be delegates, bringing with us our experiences, and reasoning based on our make up, and our environment. This is a good thing. We are all human beings, and citizens of Colorado at the end of the day. And while we may disagree on some matters, the objective and aim will be the same. And we will always find common solutions. I will listen to all sides of a matter, and be fair and seek council, even from those with an opposing view, to come to a clear solution.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I base much of my reasoning on a legal term called RPP, or Reasonable Prudent Person. In many situations, while I may tend to overthink, I will ask myself, &quot;what would a reasonably prudent person do in this situation?&quot; and If I am armed with all of the facts I usually come to a favorable conclusion, for the prudent. It is a simple approach, but it works more than it doesn&#39;t.
