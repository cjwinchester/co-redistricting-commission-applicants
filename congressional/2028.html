<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently retired, having served as the San Miguel County, Colorado, County Attorney from 1994 until I retired in February 2018.  My Colorado Attorney registration status is currently inactive. A copy of my professional resume, which was prepared while I was residing in Telluride, CO, prior to my moving to Ridgway, CO in 2002, is attached.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I received a Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in History, with honors, from Harpur College, State University of New York at Binghamton, in 1974.  I received a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Colorado School of Law in 1977.  I recently received the Law School Alumni Council&#39;s  2020 Distinguished Alumni Achievement  - Public Sector Award.

<h5>Zip Code</h5>

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My political activity since November 10, 2015, in addition to voting in the 2016, 2018, and 2020 general elections, has been primarily limited to providing campaign contributions to various candidates for political office at the county, state, and federal level, within and outside of Colorado.  The following is a list of persons and political organizations for whom I have documentation that I have donated money to since November 10, 2015: Joe Biden, Michael Bennet, Diane Mitsch Bush, Gail Schwartz, Mark Kelly, Jacky Rosen, Jon Tester, John Hickenlooper, James Iacino, Heidi Heitkamp, Barbara McLachlan, Let America Vote PAC, Giffords PAC-IE, Democratic National Committee, Yes on National Popular Vote, End Citizens United, Kamala Harris, Bill Nelson, PAC to the Future, Jared Golden, Nancy Pelosi.  I worked as a volunteer for Colorado state representative Barbara McLachlan reelection campaign during the 2020 election. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
During my tenure as the San Miguel County, Colorado, County Attorney I was a member of the Colorado County Attorney&#39;s Association, including two terms on the board of directors, and the Colorado Bar Association, those memberships ended following my retirement as County Attorney in 2018.  Since my retirement I have volunteered my services to the Town of Ridgway, where I reside, primarily with regard to planning and land  use matters.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a county attorney for San Miguel and La Plata Counties in Colorado, and as an assistant county attorney for Garfield County, CO, I devoted considerable time and effort to representing and advocating for those counties.  This advocacy included testifying on behalf of the county before Colorado legislative committees, as well as various state agencies regarding pending legislation and regulations.  Prior to my county government service I served as an attorney for the Colorado Rural Legal Services program in Grand Junction and Trinidad, CO, in that position I spent a considerable time and effort representing and advocating for the legal/civil rights of low income Colorado residents. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
After over thirty years of county government service in Colorado it would be an honor and privilege to be able to continue to serve the citizens of Colorado in one of the most significant public policy positions in state government, as mandated by both the federal and state constitutions and statutes.  Service on the commission would provide me with a meaningful opportunity to give back something of value to Colorado&#39;s citizens, using my years of public sector legal experience and expertise.    
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
During my years serving as an attorney in three Colorado county governments I obtained considerable experience promoting and achieving consensus and agreement between various county elected and appointed officials on a wide variety of matters.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
One of the principal functions of an attorney, especially one serving in the public sector, is to apply their legal training and analytical skills to the myriad of policy issues that their government clients confront on a regular basis.  This task includes the application of legal reasoning and logic to a multitude of substantive matters, from the drafting of legislation and legal agreements, to advocating for various policy positions, in both litigation and non-litigation matters.  While serving in county government I have had the privilege to litigate matters before Colorado and Federal trial and appellate courts.  I also provided legal counsel in the decennial statutory county redistricting process for San Miguel County commissioner districts in 2001 and 2011.
