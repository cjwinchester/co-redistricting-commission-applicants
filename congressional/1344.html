<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Cutter for Colorado 
I’ve always attended caucuses and voted since moving to Colorado in 1999. In 2018 a candidate I knew and trusted ran for State Representative. Even though I don’t live in her district, I supported her campaign, Cutter for Colorado, financially and as a volunteer. Specifically, I helped with her website, explaining her positions on issues as she worked to serve all Coloradoans. I also wrote emails to inform and motivate volunteers. She was elected in 2018. When she ran again in 2020, I donated and volunteered again and once again, her campaign was successful. 
</p>

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Organizing 
Since graduate school 40 years ago, I have served as president or chair of many organizations, committees and groups. My approach is to collaborate and mentor, giving participants a chance to shine while ensuring the group’s success. Taking just one example from the list above, after serving as president of our HOA in 2014 I remained on the board to finish the task of getting clear title to and then selling a parcel of land to an adjacent property owner. HOA relationships can be among the most contentious but we were able to reach consensus and help all stakeholders feel they were treated respectfully and equitably. 

Representing
I believe I can best represent others by first listening to them and understanding their point of view. My training in public relations has taught me how to ask questions, listen to answers and then represent clients and customers objectively and accurately. Most recently I have worked to represent The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a philanthropic partner working with The City of Denver and other metro communities.  

Advocating 
Last December, Light the World Giving Machines, vending machines for charity installed in Denver’s Writer Square, gave me a unique opportunity to advocate for four local and two global charities. With my public relations background, my approach to advocacy is to harness those communication and media skills. The Giving Machine donations went for uses ranging from Black child literacy to global clean water efforts. Through my advocacy, media stories ran over 30 times and thanks to the efforts of many people, the Machines raised $750,000. 

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I voted for Amendments Y and Z in 2018 and now I would like to address the problems they were intended to solve – taking the partisanship out of creating Congressional and Legislative districts. 

When every voice is heard and everyone feels represented, it takes the vitriol out of political discourse and eliminates the need to be angry and even violent. Districts that are perceived as fair are critical. 

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that people care even more about being heard than they do about being agreed with. I would encourage everyone to explain her or his position and point of view. This process almost always reveals people have more in common than they assumed. And it results in learning and novel ideas. Once everyone has been heard we can move on to finding compromise and common ground so that everyone benefits. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I approach problem-solving with this framework from Leadership Made Simple by Ed Oakley and Doug Krug: 
•	What is working?
•	What makes it work?
•	What is the goal? 
•	What are the benefits to all stakeholders of reaching that goal? 
•	What is the action plan, roles, responsibilities and measures? 

I have found this highly successful and motivating when I’ve served in leadership of the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) at the state and national level, my neighborhood and my church. 

For example, as Chair of a national task force evaluating and redesigning the PRSA’s industry-leading awards program, I brought together a team of volunteers from around the country, none of whom I knew previously. Keeping in mind the framework above, I followed this process: 
•	Research and data analysis – we studied historical data about trends in participation. We surveyed PRSA chapters nationwide. As these awards are a big source of income for PRSA, we worked on budgets and income projections. 
•	Idea generation – I relied on diverse members of the task force to brainstorm ideas and prioritize them based on our research and their own experience and creativity. 
•	Planning and project management – I was able to build on the strengths of each committee member to assign the work to those who would do it best and keep the project on track. 
•	Communication – I wrote the report and recommendations for the board of directors that resulted in significant positive changes to the program.
