</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not participated in any organized political activities other than being a voter.  
I donated $10 to the Bernie Sanders primary campaign in 2019.
I have organized and participated in small, bipartisan historical/political discussion/reading groups in my community.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Since 2015 I have not participated in any organizations.  All of my time and focus has been on teaching and creating opportunities for my students both in school and in the community.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Before 2015 I served on the board of the Colorado New World Music Festival in Boulder, CO for 2 years.  
I also spent two years serving on the board for the Colorado chapter of the American Choral Director&#39;s Association.  
Lastly, I served for two years as the assistant conductor of the Colorado Choir.
Recently, however, all of my organization and advocation has been for students and their families in terms of school activities, career opportunities, mental health and academic success.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have been keenly interested in political events and philosophy for many years now.  When I think of the great opportunities and possibilities our political system grants us as citizens I find myself consistently distressed when I hear others lamenting how sick they are of hearing about politics, especially during election season.  Participating on this commission seems like the perfect opportunity to serve my community as a citizen while addressing the unfairness that is a large part of why so many are feeling removed from the political system as a whole.  I believe my abilities to empathize, be compassionate, and be understanding of varying points will be an invaluable skill set for this commission.  I am excited to be part of increasing access and voice for every member of our state.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a teacher of High School students and a music director of performers of all ages, I have spent more than a decade honing the skills required to promote consensus.  Shared vision, and particularly a functional understanding of that vision, is imperative in achieving artistic and educational goals that help all involved feel successful, heard, and experience growth.
Every time someone is selected for participation in a class, a show, or a performance, many others are overlooked.  Fairness and impartiality are skills that have enabled me to remain professional and keep the respect of colleagues and participants.
In education, fairness and impartiality are not only best practice, but legal requirements of our jobs as teachers.  We may greatly admire certain students and may experience great frustration with others, but our primary objective is always equity in opportunity, assistance, and achievement.  By maintaining focus on the desired outcomes, I am able to overlook emotional or personal distractions and remain confident that a path to educational goals can be found for every student.
In addition, I come from an immediate family with politics on both sides of the aisle, yet we relish the chance to discuss ideas deeply and reconsider our own opinions.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Relevant analytical skills include the ability to think critically.  I have learned to constructively question ideas and assertions, from myself as well as others, allowing me to make progress and innovate where many might not even see the opportunity to do so.  
I have learned, along with my Professional Learning Community, to asses and interpret data in such a way that it becomes directly useful for our planning and instructional strategies.
My communication skills have been invaluable for working with students as well as adults.  This is especially true since as artists we are consistently bringing abstract ideas to fruition, and as I mentioned above, to reach a common goal everyone involved must understand the process and desired outcomes.
In terms of applying logic and reason to problem-solving, I believe creativity plays an important role since no situation or individual presents themselves the same way.  Every problem offers unique challenges, and to solve unique challenges requires firm principals of fairness and objectivity as well as flexibility, creativity, and real-time problem solving skills.
