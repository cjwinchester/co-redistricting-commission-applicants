</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Integrity, which I define as congruence in thought, words, and deeds, is my strongest personal value, followed closely by service to others. I&#39;m the daughter of a (deceased) 32-year Air Force fighter pilot; he and my mother (also deceased) modeled and instilled the values of fairness, equity, and service. As an engineer who coaches leaders and as a leader myself, I strive for fairness, equity, and inclusion. It seems evident that our political system will benefit from passionate people like me who can admit/recognize and set aside their personal biases in favor of helping to create a more perfect union, one in which every citizen and undocumented resident is fairly represented. I hold firmly to the belief that none of us is fully free until every one of us is, and I&#39;d welcome the chance to serve.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I&#39;m a professional facilitator with expertise in inclusion and team development, including developing cohesion among members of a Board of Directors and Executive Leadership teams. I study and teach diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as emotional intelligence, and I strive to be humble about my own weaknesses and vulnerabilities. People--friends, colleagues, clients--trust me to keep confidences, listen deeply, and offer wisdom gained through 35 years of study and practice in leadership. As an executive coach, I&#39;ve honed the ability to ask probing questions and help others find solutions that are both authentic to them and effective in their worlds.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Trained as a mechanical engineer, I spent the first 5 years of my career writing software and leading a small team whose applications controlled the real-time dispatch of 28 generating units for Public Service Company of Colorado. Designing systems and writing software in assembler (aka &quot;machine language&quot;) required the ability to grasp what needed to happen in the real world and translate that into logical, efficient, step-by-step instructions with no room for error. I was the 42nd person in the world to attain the Certified Business Analysis Profession or CBAP(r) credential, which required demonstrating 10,000 hours of practice at understanding and defining problems and requirements for solutions. I&#39;ve also designed and facilitated dozens of courses and training programs, each requiring the ability to understand the needs of real people and to design and develop useful, engaging solutions. I am a problem-solver by nature who has learned when to resist the urge to jump in with a solution and instead draw out the ideas and needs of others. It&#39;s an uncommon combination that I believe brings analysis and logic with heart, empathy, and compassion. (My minor in math is additional evidence of demonstrated analysis, logic, and reasoning abilities.)
