        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for  Briana Milligan</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
   Briana Milligan
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Briana K Milligan</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Field Sales Executive, Vertafore
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have an undergraduate degree from Colorado State Univerisity. My major was Political Science and a minor in Communications. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80246
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I grew up in a semi-political household. I then decided to study Political Science in college, with the hopes to eventually go to law school and run for office. While in college I was an aid for a State Representative and Senator. After college I went to work for a small quazi government entity in Colorado. It has been about 6 years since I worked on a campaign. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I&#39;ve attended the Colorado Young Republicans groups. I was also a member of a local group that helped out local companies within the technology industry to grow sales and seek out potential opportunities. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
For almost 5 years I worked for Colorado&#39;s Statewide Internet Portal Authority. I worked closely with government entities as well as assocations to enable technology growth throughout our state. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
For the last few years have been relatively inactive in Colorado government, even though I have a passion for it. I am a Colorado Native with a deep love for my state. With my current career and it&#39;s flexibility, I now have the time to contribute to this very necessary cause. It was 10 years ago when this last happened, at the time I was working at the State Capitol. It was then I realized how important this process is and that is important to have citizens who understand Colorado and it&#39;s political process to be involved. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am a strong believer in team work. While all of the people engaged in this process will have different perspectives, background, experiences, morals and beliefs, it is important that all voices are heard. Given my background in managing teams, working in stressful and complicated environments, as well as an understanding of the need for compromise, I am confident that I will be an asset unifying the commissioners and ensuring all are focused on the same goal.  Being a commissioner requires the ability to understand where another is coming from, encouraging open dialogue as well knowing when to refocus everyone. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Each and every day my job requires me to resolve issues that my customers are having. A lot of time, I have to work with them to think out of the box, ensure they are meeting national and international technology security laws, as well as achieving their own corporate growth strategies and goals. I am very good at looking at problem and finding multiple different ways to potentially resolve the situation. Often times these are options that I would not typically recommend, however in order to properly assess a situation, everything must be accounted for and recognized.
