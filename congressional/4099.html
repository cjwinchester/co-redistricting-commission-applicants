        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Brian Eschbacher</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Brian Eschbacher
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I lead Eschbacher Consulting, an urban K-12 education consulting firm with projects that focus on public school enrollment planning and equitable access to quality schools. Please see the attached resume for other professional positions over the past 10 years.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I graduated high school in New York, received a bachelor of science in Business Logistics from Pennsylvania State University, a Master of Business Administration from Indiana University, and a Master of Educational Leadership from the Broad Center, which is a part of the Yale University School of Management.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80238
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have voted in every election since 2015. During seven years of working at Denver Public Schools, I was the planning director for the 2012 and 2016 general obligation bonds. My wife and I donated in support of those campaigns (3A and 3B) as well as to a school board candidate who lives in my neighborhood for Denver&#39;s school board in 2017. In 2020, I made a donation to Common Cause. Other than school board, I have not donated to any local, state, or federal candidate since 2015.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I volunteered with the Denver Scholarship Foundation and served as a board member for Together We Count Colorado, focused on increasing census participation among hard-to-count communities.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My role both at Denver Public Schools and now as an education consultant is grounded in educational equity. This means ensuring systems can provide the necessary opportunities for all students to thrive and be successful. In engagement processes on the types of projects I led, this often means representing the voices of families who are not able to show up to community meetings and share their perspectives. On several occasions this was particularly challenging given that the in-person attendees may have represented a vocal minority, which forced my role to try to still recognize their perspectives while also sharing the potential views of those who were not in attendance but would be directly impacted by a proposal.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My interest in being a part of the commission starts with a core belief of the importance of independent decision-making on critical pillars of our democracy. Both in this most recent election as well as elections in our recent past, trust in the process and institutions is critical for our state. A major part of this trust is knowing that we the people select our elected officials and not the other way around. I have spent the last decade of my career seeking to bring data-driven and independent mindset to key challenges to best help our communities. Once Amendments Y and Z passed, I knew I would be very interested in being a part of the process. Further, I have experience in redistricting processes, as evidenced by leading the 2014 school board districts for Denver Public Schools, which represented over 600,000 people. I led this process through a board of directors that had strong emotions about how the lines would be drawn, yet I was able to gain unanimous approval of the resolution by engaging them along the way and leaning on a fact-based approach. Finally, since I own my own consulting business and am able to control the volume of work, I would be 100% committed to the time commitments that this process would require.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe my extensive experience working on complex, contentious school planning efforts with stakeholders of different backgrounds prepares me for this committee. During my time at Denver Public Schools, we opened more than 40 schools as well as had to close more than 20 schools. On each of these projects, there were a wide array of stakeholders with passionate yet different perspectives. As a leader of those projects, I brought a pragmatic approach and sought to build consensus given the sensitive topic of educating students, often in disadvantaged communities. I also had to lead these projects in service to a publicly elected board who wanted to see broad community support for our efforts, which encouraged me to create solutions that had widespread popularity, even if we had to compromise to get on common ground for students.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I would consider this a core strength given more than 15 years of analytical experience across several industries. I was a management consultant for 7 years focused on complex private sector supply chain challenges. I served as Executive Director of Planning &amp; Analysis at Denver Public Schools where I led a team of analysts focused on improving school options for students as well as optimizing operations expenses related to facilities, transportation, and food services. Additionally, I heavily used data in the 2012 and 2016 bond planning projects that totaled over $1 billion in capital funding for new schools and maintenance of existing schools. Since leaving DPS in 2018, I started my own education consulting firm that primarily works in enrollment planning for school systems to connect complex data systems to determine what actions are needed to meet the needs of their communities.
