        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Julie Wilson Stahli</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Julie Wilson Stahli
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Julie Christine Wilson</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Deputy Director, Upper Colorado Endangered Fish Recovery Program, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a Master&#39;s in Public Administration and a Master&#39;s of Forestry. I have a Bachelor&#39;s degree in Geography and Environmental Science with a Minor in Business
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80237
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I have recently testified before the Colorado State Legislature to promote increases in fees for Colorado Parks and Wildlife. In addition, I have testified several times in front of the Wildlife Commission in support of hunting and trapping.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated small amounts ($150 or less) to a variety of campaigns and organizations, including MoveOn, Giffords PAC, Joe Biden&#39;s campaign, Andrew Romanoff, Organizing for Action, Bernie Sanders, Cary Kennedy, American&#39;s for Responsible Gun Ownership, Jon Ossoff. In looking at these donations, they must appear to be incredibly &quot;blue&quot;. One of the things I struggle with most is the partisan nature of our current political climate.  During these recent years in particular, I have been really struggling to find science and fact in the political discourse which has been affecting where I choose to give.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have spent a lot of time volunteering in my children&#39;s school but I am not officially a member of any organizations at the moment.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe drawing redistricting lines in a fair and impartial manner is one of the most effective ways to ensure that we all get a vote that matters. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my current role, I spend the majority of my time managing groups of people towards consensus. Our organization consists of individuals from 10 independent organizations who come together to create science-based policy that affects how resources are deployed in the upper Colorado River basin. Each stakeholder comes to the table with their own ideas and their own priorities, which all must be considered in the final decision. It is rare that all parties get exactly what they are seeking in the result, but very commonly, everyone gets 80% of what they were looking for. Most importantly, all members walk away from the table as partners, fully willing to engage in discussions on the next important topic. During each of these discussions, there is always an important viewpoint to consider from each of the partners, and commonly they are closer to each other than they realize. I find it is my job to dig in to those viewpoints and find the common ground to help the partnership move forward. I like to think that I am fair and impartial - though I imagine most do. In seeking fairness, I often try to get past what people are saying to the fundamental truth that is driving them to say what they are saying. It is often there that we can find more collective understanding than in what is said initially.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have a long history of compiling and using data to assist decision makers in making rational decisions. I am extremely logical and always begin with the end in mind, and work through issues in a sequential manner until a logical conclusion is reached. I am often asked for advice specifically because I can cut through emotions and personal feelings to find the underlying problem.
