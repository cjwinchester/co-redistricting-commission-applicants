</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I voted for the formation of the commissions in 2018 because I felt then, and still do now, that the continuation of the current highly partisan politics won&#39;t end unless the redistricting process changes. The elected should not determine their electors and thus the status quo redistricting process is detrimental to our state. The process should be based on data, logic and reason, not on political advantage. 

I dropped my party affiliation over 10 years ago because I sensed that both major parties were headed away from the moderate middle.  While I am unlikely to change many minds when it comes to highly charged political topics, it seems that &quot;moderate middle&quot; is an excellent fit on a commission whose purpose is to create fair voting districts.  Fair voting districts is the only way to ensure equitable representation of all Colorado residents, and I would like nothing more than to help my state reach that goal.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
At the heart of consensus building is the recognition that the final resolution to a problem likely will not check every box for everyone, but will be a solution that presents a win for all involved with respect to their major concerns, without forcing unreasonable compromise.  

Reaching consensus is generally a smoother process when a group can agree on a concrete set of measurable, quantifiable goals.  In this case, there are already fixed criteria for redistricting that the commission must meet that provide a framework for the inevitable tradeoffs that will occur, and the guiderails to ensure that the commission moves toward the consensus necessary to achieve its goals.  However, these criteria cannot be satisfied in mathematical isolation, and consensus in this case must necessarily incorporate input from the community.

The commission must identify the key concerns of state community stakeholders, and consider those concerns as it weaves together ideas towards a map that ultimately satisfies the redistricting criteria. I believe that one of my strengths is the ability to listen critically and get to the heart of someone&#39;s concern. This coupled with my scientific training in the unbiased analysis of data will allow me to promote solutions in redistricting that address stakeholder concerns in a fair, data-driven way.



  


</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My approach to many problems, whether scientific, business or personal, often starts with the question &quot;why?&quot;.  I don&#39;t accept an argument at face value, but require that its inclusion in my analysis be grounded in fact and supported by data.   The ability to look at hard data and draw unbiased conclusions is part of my DNA as a scientist and will serve the commission well in its goal towards creating fair voting districts.
