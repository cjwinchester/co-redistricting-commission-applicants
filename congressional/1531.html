        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Michael John Ferrigno</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>

</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Mike Ferrigno </span></p>

<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Legal Counsel - TAKRAF USA, Inc.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Juris Doctorate, with a Certificate in Pubic Policy, from The Catholic University of America, Columbus School of Law in Washington, D.C.;  Bachelor of Arts in Political Science, with a minor in philosophy from Cedarville University in Cedarville, Ohio.   
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>

  80122
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I campaigned for the Ohio College Republican in 1997-2000.  I campaigned for the George W. Bush Campaign in 2004 in Wisconsin.  I advocated for comprehensive immigration reform with the Bibles, Badges and Business in 2014-2016.  I campaigned and contributed to Phil McGrane 2014 campaign for Idaho Secretary of State. I campaigned and contributed to Michelle Ferrigno Warren for U.S. Senate in 2019-2020.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Full-time attendee of Red Rocks Church, volunteer coach Littleton Soccer Club, Member of the Virginia, Idaho and Colorado State Bar, Corporate Secretary of TAKRAF USA, Inc., and member of the Association of Corporate Counsel - Colorado Chapter. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
While not in Colorado, I co-founded Christian Legal Aid of D.C. to represent low-income and homeless residents in D.C. while I worked and learned there.  DCLA was able to open various advice and referral clinics in the D.C. Metro Area, which is still operating today.  I also volunteered and advocated for comprehensive immigration reform with Bibles, Badges and Business throughout the InterMountain Region, mostly in Idaho while I lived and worked there as well.  

During the Ferrigno Warren campaign, I canvassed in Douglas, Arapahoe, and Denver County speaking in Democrats.  I enjoyed speaking to and learning about some of the issues that are most pressing to the citizens of these unique areas within the Denver-metro area.  Certainly as a Republican, campaigning for a Democrat not only allowed me to meet citizens from different backgrounds and experiences, but I enjoyed re-discovering the common themes that we, as Coloradans, have to each other.    
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to be involved in the process of redistricting the congressional seats to ensure a fair and equal representation for the people of Colorado.  As mentioned above, during my time on the Ferrigno Warren campaign, I was re-energized by the people of Colorado and being apart of this unique opportunity.  Given my bi-partisan experience, I capable of assisting the Commission with Constitution mandate to apportion Colorado&#39;s representation based upon our growing and diverse population.   
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The unaffiliated vote in Colorado is approximately 40%.  Therefore, collaboration and consensus is key to fair redistricting for the people of Colorado.  As a person who grew up in Colorado, I care deeply that each Colorado have a voice.  I do believe that in order to make our union &quot;more perfect&quot; we need to understand both the history of our state and the amazing progress that Colorado has made. With the goal of a better Colorado, a commissioner needs to think beyond party and keep the voice of the voter to strive for equal protection of Coloradans.      
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
While my formal training as an attorney, taught me to apply rules, logic and reason to a whole host of problems, for the past few years, I&#39;ve been an in-house attorney to a global engineering/supply company.  Working in the mining and steel industry (rather than in private practice), has required me to dig deep into complex facts and learn from my colleagues&#39; expertise before rushing to a decision.  It requires a complete understanding of the product and people, including technical matters plus collaboration with people from other countries and backgrounds.  Apart from my career, I am a husband and father of three school aged children, brokering deals and compromising while still focusing on parenting goals certainly brings relevant experience to problem solving with empathy and understanding.
