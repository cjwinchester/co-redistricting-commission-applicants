        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Lisa Calderon</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Lisa Calderon
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Senior City Council Aide, City and County of Denver
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I obtained my doctorate at the CU Denver School of Education and Human Development. I received my law degree from the University of Colorado School of Law. I received my Master’s degree in Liberal Studies from the University of Denver and my Bachelor’s from Metropolitan State University of Denver. 
</p>

<p>
  80205
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am the first woman of color to qualify for the ballot for Mayor of Denver in 2019 as a top tiered candidate. I have supported the campaigns of several City Council candidates including Candi CdeBaca, Tony Pigford, Miguel Ceballos Rios, and Veronica Barela. I have supported the congressional races of Stephanie Rose Spalding and Andrew Romanoff. I have served on the board of the Colorado Latino Forum, a non-partisan organization, for the approximately ten years where we have endorsed political candidates and ballot initiatives.

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a dedicated public servant, my extensive career in the areas of law and policy, executive nonprofit management, justice reform, and academia has been spent in the service of others. As a visionary leader and government accountability champion, I have developed strategic responses to ignite institutional changes to address structural inequities. I have over 25 years of experience as a tireless community advocate who creates opportunities for marginalized communities, working-class families and justice involved people. As a university professor, I have critiqued laws and policies that have disproportionate impacts on communities of color. I have collaborated with Indigenous people to highlight how tangled U.S. policies, confusing law-enforcement jurisdictions, and a lack of resources leaves Native women extremely vulnerable to violence. I have worked with tribal representatives for the intervention and application of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) in Child Protective Services (CPS) cases when conducting legal advocacy for abused women, and worked to expand educational opportunities for incarcerated Native youth while serving as an appointee of the Governor on the State Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Council.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
First, as a woman of color with the dual identities of an Afro-Latina, and as someone who has dedicated my life to creating more opportunities for marginalized people including low-income communities, youth of color, and justice involved persons, I believe we are at a critical juncture in history where every voter, regardless of party affiliation or background, needs to believe that their vote matters to help to heal the political divisions in this country. Second, in my role with the Colorado Latino Forum, I worked with Denver City Council members on the last redistricting effort for Denver County in 2012, and it was an eye opening experience. Although it was a monumental task, I learned the importance of carefully and painstakingly taking into account the myriad of considerations including expanding or diluting a community&#39;s voting power; getting as much community input as possible knowing that there were competing interests; serving communities of interest with common goals, challenges, opportunities, demographics and cultures while also taking into account future political landscapes. I also came to understand the priorities for redistricting including: one person, one vote; equality of voting for all citizens, compliance with the Voting Right Act of 1965, prevent &quot;packing&quot; disenfranchised ethnic communities or &quot;cracking&quot; communities of interest to weaken their voting power; and protecting against self-interest and personal benefit. Ultimately, a fair process will be balanced and diverse, and afford a fair opportunity for communities across the state to have a representational voice in the future prosperity of Colorado. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have been a leader in building strong coalitions to advance the rights of the working poor, criminalized people, and the voiceless. I have organized membership forums, calls to action, community education workshops, and political engagement activities.  At the local and state levels, I have advised, testified and worked on numerous legislative initiatives and worked across the aisle to build consensus and address systems of inequity and justice reinvestment. As a university professor and an experienced subject matter expert on a variety of topics related to law, public policy, gender and racial justice. I have also developed presentations and talking points to educate the community on issues of vital public interest. I worked with my community partners to showcase what was most important to them, including identifying what they were willing to fight for and invest in. For example, as the former Co-Chair of the Colorado Latino Forum (CLF), a nonpartisan advocacy organization committed to increasing Latinx participation and awareness in the electoral process, we mobilized the community on important issues to ensure that our elected officials from both parties were responsive to our needs. Our grassroots events drew hundreds of people from across the state for convenings with thought leaders, professionals, and subject matter experts in the areas of housing, economic development, education and public safety to develop solutions and sound policy ideas, strategies and expectations to ensure results from our elected and appointed officials. We made sure that our membership opportunities were accessible to every income level, and that members felt that they were getting something back for their investment such as accessibility to decision makers and advocacy.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have used my law degree and doctorate in education to research, analyze and interpret complex policy issues in all aspects of my work including making legislative presentations to City Council and as a liaison with public officials. For 12 years I served as the Legal and Social Policy Director for Safehouse Progressive Alliance for Nonviolence (SPAN) managing three staff and 30-40 volunteers. As the Legal and Social Policy Director I supervised protection order clinics in Broomfield and Boulder Counties. I coordinated a 24-hour, 7-days a week emergency response volunteer program for victims of domestic violence, and also founded a legal clinic specifically for immigrant victims.I proved to my own agency, service providers, and justice system officials that we had to fundamentally change the way the system responded to criminalized victims. Using data, testimonials, feedback groups, presentations and individual conversations I made the case a victim-defendant advocacy project to assist wrongfully arrested victims and became an expert witness on the matter. Since graduating from law school nearly twenty years ago, I have taught at the University of Colorado Boulder and CU-Denver in the areas of Women and Gender Studies and Ethnic Studies, and for Metropolitan State University and Regis University in the Criminology Departments. When we teach we learn, so it is essential that as educators we create processes to explain complex topics to students and the public in an understandable and engaging way.
