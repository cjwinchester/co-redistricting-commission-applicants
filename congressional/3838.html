        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for John Andrew Ritsick</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  John Andrew Ritsick
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>n/a</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  VP-Legal, Deputy General Counsel and Chief Intellectual Property Officer
Flex Ltd. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a B.A. in Political Science from Colorado State University, a Master&#39;s Degree in Political Science from Columbia University, and a Juris Doctorate from Georgetown University.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80220
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I was an intern at the Citizens&#39; Advocate Office under Governor Romer in 1992, and was a Clerk for Justice Michael Bender on the Colorado Supreme Court from 1999-2000. I have made donations to a handful of political campaigns over the past few years, specifically including John Hickenlooper, Michael Bennet, Mark Kelly, Jamie Harrison, and Steve Bullock, all during the 2020 campaign season. During the elections in 2020, I volunteered to cavass for votes in Arizona for the Biden campaign. I previously have contributed to other candidates, including George Brauchler&#39;s campaign for Colorado Attorney General. I may have made a few other donations since 2015 that I do not specifically recall, but the foregoing represent the substantial majority of my donations.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am on the Planning Committee for the Rocky Mountain Intellectual Property &amp; Technology Law Institute, associated with the Colorado Bar Association and Continuing Legal Education. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I did some volunteer work for COPIRG while at Colorado State University in the early 1990s, but have little recent experience advocating or representing groups or associations in Colorado. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe adamantly that balanced and impartial districts are a key element to maintaining moderation and partisan temperance in our political system. I want to serve on the Commission to help be part of the change I want to see in the world, specifically blunting the continued growth of hyper-partisanship in our country. I am convinced that our best hope of de-escalating partisanship will be to eliminate the opportunity for parties to manipulate &quot;safe&quot; districts. Without meaning to seem dramatic, I can think of no other steps more important to maintaining our republic, and I would like to be part of that effort for our State, and for my children.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am a trained transactional lawyer and negotiator -- it is my job to promote consensus, to find common ground, and to build compromises across multiple interests. Although I represents my clients&#39; interests, I have learned that successful negotiation requires  taking seriously and committing to understanding opposing and various viewpoints. Ultimately, that leads to a sense of impartiality and fairness because I am forced to &quot;stand in the shoes&quot; of those I am working with, and sometimes for. My experience is not driven solely through adversarial contexts - as internal counsel within a large public company, I am required to bridge gaps among groups who are ostensibly on the same team. I pride myself on direct, clear, professional, succinct communications. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
For over 20 years, beginning with my clerkship with the Supreme Court of Colorado, and continuing through a career in private practice and as in-house counsel to startups and public companies, my whole professional life has been built around analytical skills and applying logic and reason to solve problems. When my children were younger and wanted to know what I did for work, I would explain my job as &quot;helping people solve problems.&quot; I am required on a daily basis to explain the legal context for contractual terms, questions of compliance for business operations and corporate governance, writing policies, investigating complaints, and dozens of other matters to businesspeople, colleagues, management, and executives.
