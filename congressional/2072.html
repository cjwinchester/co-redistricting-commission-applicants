        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Jacob Lewis Ablowitz</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Jacob Lewis Ablowitz
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Chief Technology &amp; Operations Officer, Valid Evaluation Inc.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Bachelor&#39;s, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, University of Colorado at Boulder, 2002
Master&#39;s, Systems &amp; Information Engineering, University of Virginia, 2008
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80238-3279
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have studiously maintained a posture of political independence my entire adult life. I am a member of no party and have not donated to any campaigns, candidates, PACs, or causes.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have been involved in several startup- and entrepreneurship-oriented organizations, including Rockies Venture Club (as a community member) and Denver Startup Week (as a presenter). I also serve on the board of directors for a Denver-based startup company.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have been a Colorado resident for roughly half my life. My family first moved to Boulder in 1989, when I was 9 years old, and I attended Eisenhower Elementary School for 4th-6th grades, Burbank Jr High / Middle School for 7th and 8th, and Fairview High School for 9th through 12th, graduating in 1997. I continued to study Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering (minor in Business Administration) at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and while a student at CU I founded and led an organization for engineering students interested in entrepreneurship called the Society of Venture Engineers that grew to roughly 80 members.

After graduating from CU in the spring of 2002, in early 2003 at the age of 23 I moved to California to pursue professional opportunities. After spending the next 10 years across California, Northern Virginia (outside Washington DC), New York City, and western Connecticut I eagerly came back &quot;home&quot; to Colorado and intend to remain here for the long term. My children are presently 9 and 3 years old, and given my familial responsibilities, until recently my time available for civic engagement has been constrained outside my professional community involvements such as Rockies Venture Club and Denver Startup Week.

Beyond that, as I will discuss later in this application the issue of “considering [and balancing] the interests of [many] groups” is central to my academic and professional background in decision science.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I wish to serve on the commission because I feel it offers me a uniquely powerful chance to leverage my unique skills and experience in consensus-based, data-driven decision-making to make a positive impact for my community, which is important to me as a matter of personal values. I consider myself a patriot: I deeply appreciate the opportunities I have had in this country (and hope to see my children have the same or better), and I believe the stability of our constitutional republican democracy is a major contributing factor in sustaining the stability and vitality of the United States of America.

While my formal higher educational pursuits were analytical, I have invested personal time learning about political science. Through that study I have developed a strong agreement with the views of the founders of the USA, as expressed in the Federalist Papers, that a foundation of societal stability is that laws and governmental approach maximally reflect the views and culture of any given geographic region. I believe their implementation of federalism and devolution of power in ways that link government to the consent of the governed has been an incredibly important positive influence in American history, and I view gerrymandering as a major threat to continued sustainability because of how it can allow politicians to &quot;choose their voters,&quot; so to speak, rather than the voters selecting the representatives best-suited to their local views and culture. I want to be a part of solving the problem – I want to help ensure those that represent Colorado truly do reflect each region.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe few people are better suited to promoting consensus and agreement among the commissioners while maintaining fairness and impartiality: I have extensive formal training and professional experience in the process of decision-making, not only on the analytical side, but also the art of consensus-building that feeds into that science. I also have an extensively demonstrated track record as a manager and leader of people in high-stakes business situations, supporting my claim of ability to help promote consensus and agreement among the commissioners. I strongly believe that if you interviewed a group of my current and former co-workers and/or team members, themes of “fair-mindedness” and “intellectual honesty,” which are two of my most-deeply-held values, would be woven throughout their responses.

To expand a little upon my claims of formal training and professional experience in decision-making: I currently hold the position of Chief Technology &amp; Operations Officer of Valid Evaluation, Inc. (“Valid Eval”) – see https://www.valideval.com/ . The mission of Valid Eval is to help organizations make better decisions by using data and expert viewpoints to build consensus among human decision-makers in a way that builds trust in both the decision outcomes and, crucially, the process by which a decision was made. Our core product is a software toolset that accomplishes this mission in a transparent and efficient fashion. Our experience operating high-consequence decision outcomes repeatedly demonstrates that the single most critical factor in determining whether a decision is accepted by its full set of stakeholders is the degree to which those stakeholders feel trust in the decision-making process – that it was fair, comprehensive, and objective to the fullest possible extent. While our software streamlines the process considerably, I am quite capable of operating a high-trust decision process with or without that tool.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I hold two degrees and 17 years of professional experience in the field of engineering; the foundation of success in engineering is the ability to apply logic, reason, and analytics skills to solve complicated problems. The foundation of success for an engineering leader is the ability to organize and engage groups of analytically-skilled, logical people to solve a problem as a team – and engineers almost invariably hold vehemently differing opinions of the “right” solution to a given problem. Beyond that, my graduate training and experience in Systems &amp; Information Engineering particularly demonstrate the relevance of my analytical skills and ability to apply logic and reason to the types of problems that will be faced by the commission. I am formally trained and experienced in the process of rigorously and systematically breaking down complex, multi-faceted problems into their component root causes in terms of human, process, and technology factors, identifying prospective solutions while deeply considering 2nd- and 3rd-order consequences of various solution pathways and all along applying statistical and other mathematical methodologies to validate understanding of the problems and their root causes as well as model the consequences of the solution pathways.
