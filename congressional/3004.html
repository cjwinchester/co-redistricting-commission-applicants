        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Marcus Morris</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Marcus Morris
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I currently work as a legal assistant at Woody Law LLC, a family law office based in Denver, CO.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a high school diploma and a dual degree Bachelor&#39;s in Political Science and International Affairs. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80205
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
None.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have interned (unpaid) for New Era Colorado - a non-partisan organization who&#39;s mission is to increase voter turnout amongst younger Coloradans. I also did an unpaid internship for Congressman Joe Neguse nearly 2 year ago when I lived in Boulder and he was my Congressional District representative (CD2). Furthermore, I did a paid internship for an Environmental non-profit called  Conservation Colorado in the Spring og 2019.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have not done much organizing in the interest of any groups. I did a lot of youth voter mobilization to increase voter turnout within my age group.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the redistricting commission because I believe this initiative is an important step in a larger movement across our democracy to investigate how we are politically unequal and what we can do to achieve political equality; I would like to do whatever I can to to make Colorado a state that leads the nation in political equality. Gerrymandering has long plagued political representation in the United States. Racial and ethnic minorities, in particular, have been most effected by Gerrymandering because their voting patters are assumed and their votes are later divided amongst district for political gain by Democrats or Republicans. This means that if an ethnic group in Aurora is more likely to vote Democrat then while drawing district lines, a Republican legislator might want to draw border that cut into this ethnic group&#39;s concentrated presence within Aurora and separate it into multiple districts so their votes would not have as much weight. Democrats might also do the same if it were the other way around and this ethnic minority were more likely to vote for Republicans. The study, discussion, and application of fair and impartial redistricting by Coloradans, for Coloradans, is the only way to prevent further political exploitation of our state&#39;s demographics.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I think one of the most important strategies to reach consensus in any debate is to first acknowledge the validity of the opposing ideology within your own ideology. I find there’s always common ground. Another important tactic is to acknowledge the losses or adversities that the opposing party or other party might face. This way, everyone feels heard, understood, and represented. Each interest group is then more willing to compromise if they feel like they were able to get their point across this making each group session more productive. On the subject of of impartiality, I think being impartial is crucial to civic and society. To understand each other, we must be open and willing to listen and not just hear what the contributing parties are adding to the conservation. I first choose to listen with an impartial approach so that I can more clearly picture the argument or subject I’m attempting to understand. Later I apply my own reasoning if and consider the topic at hand within my personal framework if the setting asks for it.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I think my undergraduate degree where I leaned a lot of my analytical skills and critical thinking skills. It’s important to understand the history, data, and statistics of a specific region or people, to understand a law or how a type of government works but it’s also important to question those information in an attempt to better interpret and understand it. Data is helpful but with context, theories of explanation, and critical thinking, we can better understand how to apply it in real world situations.
