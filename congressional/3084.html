        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Elizabeth Anne Henna</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Elizabeth Anne Henna
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  In the past 18+ years I have served as a homemaker, stay-at-home parent, and active school and board volunteer. My paid work experience prior to that period is detailed on the enclosed resume.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  MBA from Northwestern University&#39;s Kellogg School of Management, 1998. 
B.A. in History, Magna cum Laude, from Williams College, 1991. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80027
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I served as a staff member for the Science Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, 1991-1993, and as a legislative assistant and then legislative director for a Democratic Congressman from Arizona in 1993-1995. In the past 5 years I have donated modest amounts to several Democratic Senate and Presidential campaigns and to the Judy Amabile Colorado House campaign.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have served as a trustee on the Community Board of Friends School in Boulder since July, 2013, and served as Board Chair from July, 2015 to June, 2019. I have also volunteered with A Precious Child in Broomfield.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Before I had children, I served as the assistant director of a nonprofit providing dental care to uninsured children in the Denver metro area and in many rural communities on the Western Slope. I also served on the Board of Directors of The Children&#39;s Hospital Association of Volunteers and as a trip leader in the Colorado Mountain Club. In recent years, I initiated and helped lead a successful effort to develop Friends School&#39;s new, progressive middle school in Boulder. In doing so, I helped meet demand for a middle school program focused on developing social-emotional skills and relationships as essential complements to academic courses. The program fulfills a need only partially met by the Boulder Valley School District&#39;s current middle school programs (the most similar programs are extremely limited in enrollment and not able to accept many applicants). During my tenure as Board Chair, I also chaired an inclusive process to select a new head of Friends School, balancing the interests and input of faculty and staff, parents, students, alumni, and others.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I now have time, interest, and skills to devote to this critical work. For the past 18 years, I have focused primarily on raising my children and volunteering in their schools, particularly since my spouse has a position which for many years required extensive travel and long hours. I have remained interest in political work but have not had the time to devote to it. Now that my children are older teenagers, both able to drive as of a week ago, I have more time to serve. I would now like to give back to my adopted (since 1998) state by using my time, experience, and skills to help create as fair and democratic redistricting process as possible.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Dating back to my days as a congressional staff member and as a student in a business school extremely focused on group cooperation, I have always most enjoyed working in diverse groups focused on common efforts. I helped the Congressman for whom I worked pass legislation supported by a broad coalition of environmental, energy, arms control, and deficit reduction interest groups, for example. My experience has helped me develop to be an excellent listener with the patience and willingness to look for and foster common interests in diverse groups. I also consider myself to be extremely fair. While I am a Democrat, I am most interested in supporting a democratic process that helps restore and promote people&#39;s confidence in our political system. The current distrust of government is extremely dangerous for our democracy, and the most important way to restore trust is to be transparent and as objective and fair as possible in processes such as the redistricting effort. On a lighter note, while I think I have always been a relatively fair person, certainly being a parent of two highly competitive siblings forces me to examine my fairness pretty much on a daily basis!
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
One of my majors in business school was finance, and as a staff member and trustee for Colorado nonprofits, I have been actively involved in financial management for many years. I bring strong quantitative skills as well as critical thinking to my analysis of various challenges.
