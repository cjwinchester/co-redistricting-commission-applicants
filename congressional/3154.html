<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Barbara Hopke Boyer
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am unemployed as the nonprofit I was working for had to close it doors. When functional I was the Executive Director, a role I have often held over the years with my nonprofit work.  During my career I have served as a municipal clerk (which included local election management), a municipal manager (Coolbaugh and Delaware Twps, PA), and CEO of several nonprofit organizations. Though sometime ago, these experiences and the education afforded to me during that time (and subsequent Masters Degree) have provided a significant understanding of government and elections while maintaining a nonpartisan position.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  In the late 80&#39;s I managed the phone bank/mail tracking systems for a sales tax election in Adams County and then the campaign for annexation to located DIA at its current location (both paid positions)  I have been appointed to Commission positions by both Republican and Democratic Governors (State Tourism Board and Commission for Blind &amp; Visually Impaired Individuals), and served on the Secretary of State&#39;s Voter Task Force.

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Over the past 14 years I have been an effective advocate for seniors and for the highly underserved population of those who are blind or severely visually (BVI) impaired to ensure equal opportunity.  This work was not limited to a 40 hour per week job but included work in numerous advocacy groups throughout the Denver Metro area designed to assist and support seniors in an equitable way. This volunteer work, much of which I am still doing with DRCOG AAA Advisory Committee on Aging and the Arapahoe County Council on Aging addresses a full range of senior needs.  
My most prominent achievement was having spearheaded the effort to secure funding through the JBC to allocate funding throughout the state to serve BVI seniors specifically so that they could remain living independently in their own home.  This funding has helped thousands of seniors throughout the state secure appropriate training, adaptive aids and as importantly the confidence to live their lives with dignity and be active participants in their lives with family, friends and their community.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Partisanship may serve the goals of an individual party and their platform; but it is all of us who live in a city or town, urban or rural area, the state or the country that are to be served by our government.  I strongly believe we need to build bridges on issues; not dominate them.  This is said in spite of the fact that I have my own personal perspective on specific issues. I have spent a lifetime negotiating challenges to find balance on both a professional and personal level. Relative to redistricting I do believe that it is our obligation to design districts that are fair and just in representing all of the residents of that district.  A bit “Pollyanna” like on my part; but I cannot help but hope that in such a manner we build better representation and thus, better government.  I would bring that voice to the table and represent so many of us who believe that we can make progress towards that goal of equity. As such, I think I would be an asset to the Commission in finding reasonable and appropriate ways through logical analysis of our Colorado population for redistricting and it would be an honor to serve as an essentially nonpolitical person.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
If appointed I would be the person walking into meetings with no agenda other than to achieve that which I believe the people voted for as a goal; fair and equitable redistricting.   I also understand the reality that political party representatives will have strong and maybe preconceived concepts. As someone who has always been open to hear the other sides (and there is usually more than one of those in reality).  I want to learn what I do not know and weigh the options.  That is simply how I operate in all aspects of who I am and how I function.  I attempt through questioning the answers with reasonable alternatives to point out areas of agreement and/or potential compromise.  I also do my own homework!   I have found though my years of experience with extensive dialogue and copious notes that pointing to the facts, using hard numbers and taking into account the emotional content involved of others’ perspective that there is a win and a loss but compromise can be achieved.  I should note that I have not always been successful in every negotiation I have participated in; however, more often than not compromises were achieved in part because of my participation.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Being a well-educated professional with years of experience, I have had to weigh issues, do the research and make decisions as a member of a group or as the decision maker.  I have learned to heavily rely on reason, logic and facts taking into account the consequences of the decision.  I do not jump to conclusions, acquiesce to alliances or the philosophies/commitments of others.  I assess to the best of my own reasonable perspective based on information gathered, keeping in mind the goal of the issue at hand and the effect(s) of my decision.  In considering my application for this Commission I am consciously committed to continuing my personal approach to decision making; not aligning with a political party for gerrymandering but using the facts and figures we secure to make the best decision for the public.
