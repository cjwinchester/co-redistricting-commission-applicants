<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>

  KL&amp;A Engineers &amp; Builders in Golden, CO.

  Master&#39;s degree in structural engineering from the University of Colorado in Boulder (2020)
Bachelor&#39;s degree in civil engineering from Colorado State University in Fort Collins (2018)
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
As a general contractor, it was important to maintain a positive relationship with all of the trade partners working on site to keep them coordinated and functional. As a project engineer with Martines Palmeiro Construction (MPC) I had to advocate for both the organizations who worked under mine and our clients in the day-to-day tasks in the field. Often times a trade partner would interfere with another trade partner’s work for their own convenience. I had to ensure that the best interests of all the trades were executed in order maintain a functional site. Furthermore, it was also my responsibility to ensure that the best interests of the owner were being executed despite the fact that the owner was not present on site. Nearly all of the trade partners I worked with are based in Colorado, as many of them are small businesses in the Denver area. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In the past five years, I have been interested but not heavily involved in political activities outside of voting. I have not given money to any organizations other than the perchance a Marco Rubio bumper sticker in 2016. At the end of 2019 I also signed a petition in Colorado that put Proposition 115 on the 2020 ballot and made a $5 donation supporting the initiative 

Although I grew up in a mostly conservative household, I am an independent thinker who may align with the Libertarian party rather than the Democratic or Republican party. I even voted Libertarian in 2016 because I felt that both of the two major candidates were not representative of how most people in America think. But because I do not want to subject myself a political party, I am an unaffiliated citizen and have chosen to apply for this commission as such. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I spent the majority of the past five years since November 10, 2015 as a student at both Colorado State University (CSU) in Fort Collins and University of Colorado (CU) in Boulder. Because of this most of my public involvement was within my university community. At CSU I served as student ambassador for the College of Engineering, which I belonged to. As an ambassador I worked primarily with high school students considering majoring in engineering, at CSU or otherwise. I gave advice to these students as they made their college decisions and offered my perspective to them as both an engineering student and as a CSU Ram. 

At the end of my undergraduate education at CSU, I joined a professional origination known as the Order of the Engineer. This is an organization that upholds the ethical standards of engineers in our society. As many people entrust their lives with the structures and technology designed by engineers, this organization continuously reminds them of the responsibly they hold.

In graduate school at CU, I earned a scholarship from the Structural Engineers Association of Colorado (SEAC) and have attended a number of meetings and site visits with the organization since. Although I am not an official SEAC member, I am currently considering joining this organization as well. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I would like to serve on the commission because I want to ensure that the representative district boarders are drawn fairly without the effects of gerrymandering. As an unaffiliated voter, generally displeased with the two party system, I am interested in making sure the Colorado State representatives in congress are elected fairly and competitively. 

Colorado unfortunately has a history of gerrymandering in order to give one political party more power over another. Districting commissions often also re-draw districting lines in order to protect their own seat (or the incumbent member of their party) in office. These tactics need to stop in order for the voice of the people of Colorado to truly be heard. If the districts are organized such that the representative earns the votes of their constituents. This is very important to me as a Colorado voter because not only to I want my voice to be heard, but I want to ensure the same for my fellow Coloradans. Especially if Colorado is to obtain an eighth seat in the House of Representatives. 

The great President John F. Kennedy said, “Let us not seek the Republican answer of the Democratic answer, but the right answer. Let us not seek to fix the blame for the past. Let us accept our own responsibility for the future.” My primary goal as a member of this commission will be to seek that right answer. I love this state, and I believe that the governmental tactics and changes taking place here in Colorado have been and continue to be a model for the nation. That is why I am interested in serving on the commission, not only to serve my state but to serve my country.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a member of the commission, I will advocate for the use of the shortest-split line method to divide the voters throughout the state into fairly divided, equally populated areas. The use of this algorithm is at least a good place to start, because it uses a mathematical method that is free of bias. I would also use that as an argument among the other commissioners, because you can’t argue with math. As an engineer, I am good at both being analytical and convincing of an impartial answer. 

Next, I think it’s worth considering the cultural density of the various areas of the state. For example, because Baca County and Prowers County are culturally similar to each other, it may make sense to group them together in the same district. However, it is important to make sure there is a healthy amount of competition for the candidates running to represent these districts. For example if it is known that the majority of voters in Weld County are Republicans and the majority of voters in Larimer County are Democrats, it may make sense to group Weld and Larimer County together in the same district to encourage both the Republican and Democratic candidates for that district to campaign harder to earn their votes. 

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Being a structural engineer, logic and reason come very naturally to me. I am a fast learner and an analytical thinker. I am exceptionally good at Excel and I enjoy solving mathematically interesting problems. I am also a young and enthusiastic individual who likes a good challenge. 

When I was a graduate student at CU, I had to apply these skills to my research project in order to report accurate and unbiased results. For this project, I was tasked investigating the effects of a polymer additive on the freeze-thaw properties of concrete. To do this, I had to college and analyze a significant amount of data over the course of several months. I also had to write and defend my thesis in front of several faculty members and concrete experts to prove my results were valic. I would take a similar approach to the task of re-districting Colorado. My “data collection” phase would involve hearing the voices of my fellow Coloradans scattered throughout the state. My “analysis” phase would be the actual re-drawing of the district lines with the assistance of the other commissioners. And finally my “defense” phase would be to convince and mediate among the other members of the committee.
