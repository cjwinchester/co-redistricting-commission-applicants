<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I usually attend my precinct caucus, especially in presidential election years. My recent political activity has been confined to monetary support. In the 2016 election, I contributed to the campaigns of Hillary Clinton, Michael Bennet, and the Congressional campaigns of Ed Perlmutter, Morgan Carroll and Gail Schwartz. I also contributed to Mike Carrigan and Beth McCann in their campaigns for Denver District Attorney. In the 2018 election, I contributed to several state legislative candidates and also the following state-wide candidates: Phil Weiser for Attorney General, Mike Johnston and Jared Polis for Governor, Dave Young for State Treasurer and Jena Griswold for Secretary of State. I also contributed to the congressional campaigns of Jason Crow, Ed Perlmutter, Joe Neguse, Karen McCormick and Diane Bush. I also made contributions to the campaigns of Stacy Abrams and Beto O&#39;Rourke. For the 2020 election, I contributed to Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden for President, John Hickenlooper for Senate and to the congressional campaigns of Jason Crow, Jill Freeland, Ike McCorkle and Diane Bush. In addition I made contributions to various candidates for US Senate in other states, including Dr. Barbara Bollier, Amy McGrath, Doug Jones, Paula Jean Swearengin, Mark Kelly, Steve Bullock, Theresa Greenfield, Cal Cunningham, Sara Gideon, Rapheal Warnock, Jon Ossoff, and Jamie Harrison. I also contributed to several candidates for district attorney and the state legislature in Colorado and made contributions to the Colorado Democratic Party. This fall I did a literature drop in my neighborhood one weekend urging registered democrats to vote.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I belong to various legal professional organizations including the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the Colorado Trial Lawyers Association, the Colorado Criminal Defense Bar, the Colorado Hispanic Bar Association and the Faculty of Federal Advocates. I serve on two Colorado Supreme Court rules committee, for appellate rules and the rules of evidence. In 2018 I concluded over eight years of work as a member and, for my last four years, chair of the Judicial Performance Commission for the Second Judicial District. I am also a volunteer board member for Together with the Children, a 501(c)(3) that raises fund for JUCONI (Juntos con los Ninos), an organization that works with street-involved children and their families in Puebla, Mexico. For a more detailed explanation of my professional activities, please see my attached website biography.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
While I have always been active in my professional associations, my most recent experience was serving as a gubernatorial appointment to the Colorado Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice (CCJJ) from 2012 to 2018. This is a group consisting of many stakeholders in the criminal and juvenile justice systems. The work of the commission is focused on evidence-based recidivism reduction initiatives and the cost-effective expenditure of limited criminal justice funds. I also was on the board of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) from 2011-2019. NACDL is a nonprofit voluntary professional bar association that works on behalf of criminal defense attorneys to ensure justice and due process for those accused of crime or misconduct. NACDL was founded in 1958. It has a nationwide membership of many thousands of direct members, and up to 40,000 with affiliates. I am also active in NACDL serving as co-vice chair of the amicus committee for the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals and as a member of the public defense committee.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that partisan gerrymandering is one of the primary causes for the current legislative dysfunction in this country. I supported Amendments Y and Z and was very happy that Colorado voters approved both. I believe that if Colorado does this right, we can become a model for other states to hopefully bring an end to partisan gerrymandering. The US Supreme Court found no constitutional problem with gerrymandering, so states are going to have to fix this problem. I don&#39;t underestimate the difficulty of this task or its importance, but I believe my long experience working collaboratively with others would help the Commission be successful. As I am limiting my legal practice, I have time to devote to important public service work.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have worked collaboratively in many different professional settings. For decades I was a member of the Executive Council of the Criminal Law Section of Colorado Bar Association which consists of six defense lawyers, six prosecutors and six judges. As mentioned I was a member of the CCJJ for eight years. The primary work of CCJJ is accomplished in task forces and committees, which often work several years employing evidence-based analysis to propose reforms to the criminal justice system. The members of CCJJ represent the many stakeholders in the criminal justice system including prosecutors, probation, parole, law enforcement, victims, local government, state legislators, community corrections and the department of corrections. I believe I was a productive member of CCJJ not only because I was diligent in my work on the commission, but because I strove to be fair and impartial, work collaboratively and to listen to and understand the viewpoints of others. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a lawyer, my career has been dedicated to helping my clients with their legal problems. As a litigator, my career has been devoted to analyzing facts and applying the law to those facts. As an appellate lawyer, my job is to study the trial record in a case, identify potential issues, analyze those issues, and then applying the law to the facts of the case make persuasive arguments to the appellate court on behalf of my client.
