<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I am currently facing the challenges of advocating for the construction of a Community Recreation Center here in Denver. I have represented my fellow students at the University of Denver on the Student Senate and helped to enhance recycling at the university. As a member of the Cedar Pointe Homeowners Association, I have advocated for various quality of life improvements. As a non-government delegate for two rounds of Kyoto Protocol climate negotiations, I have developed experience being an effective advocate for a position. More importantly, through my involvement in a variety of organizations listed above and my passion for the outdoors I have had an opportunity to visit and meet a variety of different stakeholders throughout this state. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Our Republic functions and thrives when our elective representatives effectively represent the will of the people. Over the last twenty years, I have observed hyper partisan gerrymandering being utilized to disenfranchise one group or another. The redistricting process has been hijacked by both parties to achieve shortsighted political objectives in the legislature. 

What I admire about the non-partisan redistricting commission is end this shortsighted political gerrymandering that undermines the confidence in our democracy. I envision a commission that leverages data to redistrict in a fashion that is fair and just for all and that provides each of the 64 counties appropriate elective representation and voice for all Coloradans in the public policy process. 

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My experience in promoting consensus and contributing to agreement derives from years of organization involvement from serving on the All Undergraduate Student Senate at the University of Denver, my state legislature experience, nonprofit work, delegate to two rounds of climate negations, organizational involvement, and my involvement with activities in the community.

 As a former Peace Corps volunteer, and avid global traveler, I have international experience and cultural immersion to better understand the various facets of conflict. Navigating challenges and conflicts in three languages -- English, Spanish, and Guaranί -- as a Peace Corps volunteer in Paraguay very much empowered me in resolving conflict. 

As someone trained in mediation and facilitation at the University of Denver, Crisis Intervention Training (CIT), and Crisis Negotiation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation I have unique skills to actively listen, understand, and build common ground between disparate parties. 

As a Deputy Sheriff, during the last thirteen years I have served in a fashion that has been fair and impartial to all parties. 

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a Deputy Sheriff Captain, I employee analytical, logic, and reasoning daily as I supervise the Denver County Jail. In my capacity as a supervisor, I extrapolate data from programs such as Power BI and other sources to make analytical decisions. I employee logic and reasoning to navigate a whole variety of different incidents and issues confronted during a shift. Depending on the circumstance, I utilize both deductive and inductive reasoning to decide if an argument/decision is valid or weak. For example, addressing an inmate in crisis in a manner that is humane and with sound reasoning. Or addressing public policy issues in a manner that is consistent with the law and sound reasoning.
