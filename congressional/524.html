        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Ruth Marie Nerenberg</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>

<p>
  Ruth Marie Nerenberg
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Retired. Currently volunteer president of the League of Women Voters of Pueblo. Board member approx. 15 years. Last paid employment 2009-2012, with ACOVA, the victim advocate program of the Pueblo County Sheriff&#39;s Department. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Have a bachelor&#39;s degree in English. Am trained to teach reaction to traumatic death, victimology and death notification. During my 15 years as a volunteer and paid staff, I learned to talk with people and intercede on their behalf. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81007
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I started advocating for crime victims in the late 1990s as part of the Sheriff&#39;s Department&#39;s ACOVA (victim advocate) program. Later, as I joined League, I saw how supporting legislation could assist crime victims. I have always believed that organizations with similar goals should work together, and I try to bring League representation to every other organization I get involved with, and vice versa. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Member of League of Women Voters of Pueblo for approximately 15 years; currently president. Have not donated to any candidate or party since I became president, except for a small amount to a personal friend who ran unsuccessfully for city council.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Board member of LWV-Pueblo since approx. 2009. Current member of the local NAACP branch. Former board member for the YWCA of Pueblo, which operates a domestic violence shelter. Founding member of the Heroin Task Force in Pueblo, which became the Substance Use Response Ecosystem (SURE). Former co-chair of SURE community pod; presently a member of it&#39;s prevention pod. Currently chair of the Colorado LWV&#39;s Nominating committee and represent LWVCO on Action 22. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that both these commissions are extremely important for healing the great divides that exist in this country. I believe that gerrymandering has disenfranchised and disempowered people from the &quot;other&quot; party, whichever one is out of power when the districts are drawn. All Coloradoans need to have their points of view heard and fairly represented. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I learned to listen to others, and to talk with them, as a victim advocate. It can be difficult, sometimes, to avoid blaming victims for their circumstances. And for my own safety I had to be able to read faces and body language to know when someone was about to become angry or react badly to their situation. I&#39;ve gotten quite good at validating others, listening to their point of view, listening for what they don&#39;t say as well as what they do say. I have a few personal rules. 1. Listen to others and validate what they say. Even if you ultimately disagree, they will feel like they&#39;ve been heard. 2. When things go wrong, apologize if someone needs to hear it, even if you feel like you didn&#39;t do anything wrong. It shows a willingness to accept responsibility, and calms others down. 3. Stay civil. He who uses stereotypes and perjorative terms for others doesn&#39;t have a good argument, and therefore loses the argument.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I can listen to all of the side discussions, and keep them in mind, but then concentrate on the core issue. I understand that people have emotional reactions sometimes, and need to be reminded to focus on the facts. For instance, I was on a board where the executive director was caught embezzling. People on the board who considered her a friend tried to defend her behavior, thought it was a mistake. I was one of the few who believed it was a crime immediately, and one of only two who could muster the nerve to say, &quot;look at the checks. This is a crime. Your feelings are important but you must recognize reality.&quot;
