<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My wife and I have given a small financial gift to the Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL).  We have not donated to any candidates or PACs.  I handed out a few get-out-the-vote flyers for President Obama&#39;s reelection campaign in 2012.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I cherish democracy and I want it to work for all Coloradans.  Elections should represent real choices between candidates that have different platforms but shared commitment to equality and the rule of law.  I am enthusiastically willing to serve on this commission because I believe that I am well-suited for this task.  I am trained in applying quantitative and qualitative analysis to investigate and address important challenges in public policy.  I enjoy spirited and respectful dialogue.  I love to learn, to listen to other perspectives, and to forge agreement among competing interests.  The Colorado redistricting process can help facilitate responsive and effective government. That is an important mission that I would be excited to join. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a voter affiliated with the Democratic Party, I would begin the process of this work by assuming that all the members of the commission -- Independent, Democratic, and Repbublican -- are people of good faith and goodwill.  I would listen to commission staff and to the other commission members before making judgments.  I have training in and practice with Nonviolent Communication (NVC), which I would use to find solutions to disagreements that address the competing values and needs of different commission members.  I enjoy working collaboratively and find humor and joy even in awkward and contentious discussions.  

As a teacher, I frequently balance the needs of students with different learning styles, parents with diverse expectations, and colleagues with disparate experiences.  I work in a tradition (Montessori education) that emphasizes grace and courtesy above ranking and competition.  My belief system (shaped by Mennonite theology) emphasizes the dignity of all and the need for humility and forbearance in approaching conflict.  I am an effective communicator who can synthesize ideas and express the perspectives of others.  

In states where parties maximize their redistricting advantage, both major parties have “safe” districts that make general elections non-competitive and promote primary battles that increase polarization. Democrats have made gains in recent cycles in Colorado, but the political tides are always subject to change.  In creating a political map, we should keep communities, neighborhoods, and watersheds whole (or as complete as possible). In a fair map, there will be a spectrum of districts, some strongly Republican-leaning, some strongly Democratic-leaning, but also many that are more neutral and competitive.  The voices of passionate partisans (of all stripes) should be heard, but they should not drown out more moderate, or even less politically-engaged citizens.  

My commitment to this process would be first as a Coloradan, not as a Democrat.  While I would not abide Republican members pressing their advantage, neither would I seek a map that was favorable to Democrats at the expense of fracturing communities and constituencies.  I know that I would be one of twelve perspectives and that the closer the commission came to unanimous consensus, the more likely that our work would be accepted by our fellow citizens and resistant to potential court challenges. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have extensive training in statistical analysis, econometrics, and quantitative methods.  Professionally, I teach mathematics (everything from counting to calculus) and American Government and provide counsel to adolescents beginning to navigate the adult world.  I enjoy math puzzles and textbook and applied problems, and I regularly use metaphors and analogies to explain complex concepts.  I have two elementary-aged children and a brilliant wife, and I frequently negotiate our schedules, activities, and dinners, often (though not always) with success.  I can crunch numbers on spreadsheets, and create and interpret graphs, charts, and other data visualizations.  I understand math, especially the probability and statistics that will be useful in quantifying degrees of representativeness and equality in this work.  I quickly integrate new information and I am well-versed in academic and popular writing in political science and public policy.
