<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
When I recognize a need in my community instead of simply ruminating about it I like to get involved. After the shooting at Parkland I knew I needed to do something to advocate for the safety of my children and all the children in Fort Collins. I joined Moms Demand Action to help advocate for gun violence prevention and with a few months of joining I was stepping up to be a co-lead of my local chapter. 
When I saw restaurants suffering and frontline workers exhausted during the pandemic I stepped up and created Feed the NoCo Frontline. With this effort I raised donations to purchase meals from restaurants to feed health workers and boost their morale up. When I was concerned about electing democrats this year I got involved with Blue Rising to endorse qualified candidates and help raise funds for their campaigns. Once again with the Congressional Redistricting Commission I see a need; I want to step up to help represent the interests of Democrats. I enjoy being an active citizen and I would love to have the opportunity to advocate for Democrats on this Commission that will have ramifications for our state for at least the next ten years.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am so proud of Colorado for moving to a bipartisan commission as a way to fairly determine its future Congressional districts. I think it&#39;s incredibly important that we create Congressional districts that reflect our communities and values, and are beyond scrutiny. Although a proud Democrat I am above all a proud Coloradoan who wants to see democracy work for all in this state. I would like to be part of this historic Commission to help ensure a fair and equitable districting plan for our state. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
When I created Feed The NoCo Frontline I wanted to get assistance to restaurants and frontline workers as quickly as possible. Several people in the communities reached out to offer their help and within 24 hours I had a team of five working together to coordinate the effort. I had never created a fundraiser of this extent and neither had any of the people who were working with me. We all, however, had great ideas and the willingness to bring some light to those suffering in our area. By listening to my volunteers and asking for their opinions together we created a remarkable organization that was up and running in just over a week. Because I actively solicited ideas from not only those working with me but from the hospitals we were assisting and even other members in the community my little idea to help a few restaurants grew into an effort that had a much greater impact than I could ever have imagined. In the end Feed the NoCo Frontline raised over $36,000, assisted 50 restaurants and delivered over 3000 meals to frontline workers throughout all of Northern Colorado. I believe our efforts were so successful because we recognized the talents and contributions of each member and worked to get agreement on all the major decisions we made.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I ran a successful small business for four years before selling. Running a business on your own is a constant juggling act - trying to determine the products that will sell, marketing to potential customers, getting product packaged and shipped, determining inventory flows and constantly innovating. In addition to my core online business I recognized a desire on the part of my clientele for a related travel business. With no previous experience I was able to put together a week long conference on the Greek island of Mykonos. I was able to map out the hurdles my plans would face with international travel, importing products into Greece, arranging for lodging and meals for 70 attendees, and creating meaningful and well thought out classes and activities for  week with only the help of one assistant.  Although I did my best to plan for any unforseeable events there were of course issues that cropped up in the planning and through the course of the week. Each time I was able to look at the problems objectively and determine outcomes that insured the attendees were well taken care of and satisfied with every aspect of their trip.
I apply that same level of tenacity and determination to every aspect of my life. When I encounter an issue I like to look at it from all sides, confer with other interested parties and determine several options before arriving at a conclusion precisely as I had as a small business owner.
