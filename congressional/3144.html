<h3>Background</h3>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Shortly after my husband and I moved to Colorado in 2011, I began volunteering at The Delores Project – a shelter for women and transgender individuals experiencing homelessness.  Initially, I was part of a group that prepared and delivered meals to the shelter every other Monday.  Then, I was asked to join the board and for nearly 7 years was a board member, Treasurer and finally President of the board.  Our board and staff advocated for better housing solutions, trauma informed care, and paths to stability. Residents felt safe, cared for and supported so they could begin their journey to obtain stable housing.  During my time on the board we partnered with Rocky Mountain Communities and redeveloped our site to build a new shelter facility as well as 35 units of low income permanent supportive housing and 95 units of affordable housing for individuals and families in the workforce.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am at a point in my life that I have the time to serve and the desire to give back to my community by serving on the commission. My background in accounting and finance and community involvement has given me the tools necessary to be able to contribute meaningfully to the commission.  I am also fair minded and independent with no agenda to push and I am sincerely interested in ensuring a fair process while focusing on protecting Communities of Interest. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The first step needed to promote consensus begins with setting ground rules for the commissioners that everyone agrees to follow.  The second step needed is to set goals for the commission.   As conflicts arise, the team should revisit the ground rules and goals and work to resolve the issue in a way that is fair and respectful of the voices and opinions of everyone involved.

I believe that I am fair and impartial and that all people deserve to have their voices heard, even if I do not agree with them.  I believe in respecting the humanity of every individual.  Better boundaries make better representatives because their focus will be on serving the people of Colorado and not on increasing their power. 


</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My career and life experience as an auditor, controller, treasurer, board member and board president have given me the opportunity to use my analytical skills to investigate, solve problems, listen, collaborate with others, question techniques and processes to find solutions and create efficiencies
