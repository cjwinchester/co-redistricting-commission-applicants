I am happy to submit supplemental information/documentation that may be required in order to capture any and all additional donations made by me during this period.

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Board of Trustees of Paddington Station Preschool; Board of Trustees of Colorado Academy; American Civil Liberties Union member; Symposium on Race member; Country Club Historic Neighborhood member; Colorado Bar Association member; alumni volunteer for University of Colorado Law School
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
In my current professional role at Invest in Kids, I advocate for the interests of Colorado&#39;s youngest children and their families through grant applications to foundations and other funding sources, seeking funding for the programs Invest in Kids implements across the state.  I have taken an active role as a Board member at two of my children&#39;s schools, Paddington Station Preschool and Colorado Academy.  As someone keenly interested in politics, I have long been involved in organizing support for individual politicians who I believed represented the interests of Coloradans, including in the areas of equal access to justice, women&#39;s rights, environmental protection, economic fairness and mobility, among other issues.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am very interested in participating generally in civic matters, and specifically in ensuring continued fairness in Colorado&#39;s elections.  Colorado has taken many excellent steps in recent years to enact election laws and implementing regulations that have made it easier and more accessible for Coloradans to vote and participate in all levels of federal, state, and local elections.  In addition, I am strongly in favor of nonpartisan, citizen-led redistricting efforts; this fair and transparent process will lead to voters having more faith in the value of their vote. and (hopefully) even greater participation (the recent election had a tremendously impressive turnout!)  It truly is time for the end of backroom deals, horse-trading, hidden motives, gerrymandering by political parties in order to promote special interests, and time instead to promote faith in the political process across the board.  I would consider it a privilege to work with fellow Coloradans on the Redistricting Commission, and a good way to give back to the state that I&#39;ve loved since moving here in 1990.  While I haven&#39;t taken a formal or paid role in a political campaign or office, I&#39;ve been a close follower of politics since I was a teenager in Brooklyn, N.Y., and am excited for the opportunity to work at this fundamental, grassroots level.  I believe that the Redistricting Commissions can have a great impact on Colorado citizens&#39; belief in government, elections, and their participation actually making a difference.  While I am not sure that I&#39;ll ever want to run for office myself, I really enjoy the political process and ensuring that as many people can participate as possible. I believe that my experience and skills will enable me to contribute to the redistricting process and help ensure that folks have faith in what the Commission accomplishes. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I trained as a lawyer and worked previously as an Associate for the law firm of Holland &amp; Hart LLP in Denver and as General Counsel for a boutique Denver-based investment bank called Q Advisors LLC.  Throughout my professional career, I have worked hard to bring opposing parties together, approaching each interaction and transaction as an exercise in stating goals, listening to varied arguments and proposals, and coming to agreement through discussion and compromise.  I clerked for a U.S. District Judge in Denver after law school, and decided that litigation wasn&#39;t the path I wanted to pursue.  My interest in corporate transactional work stemmed from a belief that in this area, all parties started from a position of wanting to making a deal work, and were seeking agreement on the best terms available to them, rather than approaching each other in conflict and anger, as I had witnessed in litigation.  I have worked with many different constituencies in both my professional and volunteer positions, and feel that I have been able to elicit and contribute to honest and frank discussions, remaining open to different opinions.  I believe in educating myself and listening to varied sources, in order to make sure that I understand different positions and analyses rather than always insisting that my initial view is or was correct.  While I certainly have strong opinions on many matters, I also have a firm belief in others&#39; right to their own opinions based on their own knowledge and analyses and never discount other people&#39;s experiences and beliefs. I try to be mindful of any implicit biases that I have that could impact my opinion of others or their beliefs, and be respectful of the right of everyone to be heard.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I believe that my law school education has been incredibly helpful to me not just in my professional life but also in my personal life. The training that I received in research, analysis, learning and thinking about all sides of an issue, history, and writing has led to a deeper understanding of the ways in which the American legal system impacts individuals; it also has enabled me to approach various life experiences with an open mind.  I continue to learn and expand my understanding of issues and try hard not to come to a quick conclusion or always insist on my own perspective being the &quot;right&quot; one. I have worked and volunteered alongside folks of varied lived experiences, and appreciate the ability to learn from their different perspectives.  (I know a lot of lawyers advise younger people not to go to law school, but I have always thought that the education I received gave me a great skill set that is applicable to so much of the adult experience!)  I feel I am able to approach issues with an analytical perspective from the outset, and then gather information to inform my ultimate decision or opinion.
