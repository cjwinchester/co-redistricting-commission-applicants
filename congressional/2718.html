<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>

I was selected in a competitive, College Board process, to serve as the first Advanced Placement (college level) Human Geography consultant in Colorado, training other high school AP Geography teachers.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I strongly believe that gerrymandering, whether by Democrats in Maryland or Republicans in Georgia, undermines the fundamental principals of democracy and fairness. I understand how gerrymandering is established and its impacts - and find it highly disturbing and unethical. I believe in service to others and to the larger community where my background and skill sets may be useful. I am also tough minded and pushed for the requirement of teaching Geography in high school courses in Colorado, using active learning lessons. This was strongly resisted by teaching colleagues. I am also tough minded enough to cut off any efforts by outside lobbyists or political interests to attempt to sway my best judgements based on geographic facts and patterns, if I were to serve on the commission.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have been the lead sponsor of our 80-120 student Boulder H.S. Model United Nations academic team for the past 15 years. I have also served as the state coordinator for Colorado H.S. Model U.N. When we train our students to participate as diplomats in simulated U.N. conferences we stress that they represent their country accurately, but are courteous and diplomatic, and collaborate with other student delegates. This represents my personal philosophy in leading Social Studies teachers in the Boulder Valley Schools, as Department Chair at BHS, and leading other teachers serving as Model U.N. sponsors. When I taught American Government, I always brought in both liberal Democrats (ie., former Congressman Tim Wirth) and conservative Republicans (ie., Steve Bosley, CU Regent) to explain their political philosophies. I taught in a non-partisan manner and never told students my political philosophy, that I am a moderate Democrat - liberal on social justice and environmental issues, but an economic conservative. I grew up in eastern Nebraska where my father was a large animal veterinarian and my mother was a university professor. I was raised to be fair, tolerant, friendly, and courteous - and had parents who modeled that behavior. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have taught about gerrymandering in my 39 years of teaching high school American Government and Advanced Placement Human Geography courses, in my Geography classes at the University of Northern Colorado and when leading A.P. Human Geography workshops for other teachers in multiple U.S. states and six foreign countries. I provided these students and teachers concrete activities, including having students modify two separate maps of Congressional districts in Colorado - one to favor Republicans and one to favor Democrats - followed by lively discussions. I only learned of the opportunity to possibly serve on this commission last night (Nov. 8), so do not have letters of recommendation. If I make it through the first round, I can provide letters of recommendations.
