        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Mark Johan Bloomfield</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Mark Johan Bloomfield
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Mark Johannes Bloomfield</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>

  Recently sold my Green Building Consulting company after 12 years of ownership (see uploaded resume).  Currently assessing what my next career will be, and interested in giving back to the community by participating in this commission.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, Rice University, 1995; 
RESNET Certified HERS rater (Home Energy Rating System); 
BPI Certified Building Analyst, (Building Performance Institute); 
Integral Center Interpersonal Facilitator training.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Past political activity includes knocking on doors for presidential campaigns, and doing &quot;lit drops&quot; for local City Council/Ballot issues.  I&#39;ve donated $200 or less to the campaigns listed in the attached .CSV file.  I&#39;ve also donated to organizations that promote voting rights, such as FairFight.org and Vote Save America.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Boulder County Planning Commission; 
Better Boulder - Leadership Team; 
RESNET (Residential Energy Services NETwork) - my former company was a member; 
Colorado Green Building Guild - my former company was a member
BPI- Building Performace Institute - my former company was a member; 
Integral Center - Community center focused on Integral principles - was a member and facilitator.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I&#39;ve had a long history of representing different groups, including Boulder Ultimate frisbee players (Grass  Roots Ultimate), my former condo homeowners association, the people of Boulder County as a Planning Commissioner, and the people of Boulder and surrounds, as a member of the Better Boulder Leadership team.  I&#39;ve worked hard to represent the constituents of each, and where relevant, sought to grow that constituency to strengthen the institution and increase its reach.  As a Boulder County Planning Commissioner, I seek to dispassionately apply the land use regulations, while taking into account the rights of property owners and the concerns of the public.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I&#39;ve long held that equal representation is the bedrock of a healthy democracy.  In these contentious times, there are many attempts to disenfranchise voters or gerrymander districts to one party or the other&#39;s favor.  It is corrosive to democracy and hampers our ability to get anything done at the federal level.  Because of issues of corruption of power I&#39;ve seen on both sides, I&#39;ve never belonged to a political party, preferring to vote for the candidate that I believe will be best for Colorado and the Country.  I believe that fair representation includes representation of all Coloradans, regardless of income, race, religion or gender identification.  I&#39;m frankly incensed that this commission is poorly paid - it self selects a generally older and more affluent applicant - the ones that already wield the power in our society.  While it won&#39;t be easy for me to participate given the hours needed and the scant compensation, I&#39;m willing to work hard so that I can fight for the equal representation of all Coloradans, especially those that would never have the means to participate in a virtually unpaid commission.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I&#39;m a naturally curious person who seeks to understand the differing opinions of others so that I can understand their perspective.  Having done some interpersonal communication facilitation, when I&#39;m communicating with another I focus on &quot;getting their world&quot;, so I can better understand an &quot;opposing&quot; position.  Rather than seeking gain for one political party or another (since I belong to neither), I would focus on the requirements of the redistricting criteria.  Where conflicts do arise, I would seek to balance the needs of different constituencies - rural, urban, communities of color, the working poor while striving to create competitive districts so the voters can have real choice in each election.  I believe that such competition strengthens the marketplace of ideas, resulting in the best outcome for Coloradans.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My degree in mechanical engineering is a strong foundation for applying reason and logic to the thorny issue of redistricting.  From there, life experience has further developed those skills - having run a small business for 12 years, having served on several non-profit boards, and having worked as a Boulder County Planning Commissioner, I&#39;ve been able to take complex requirements, evaluate the needs of different constituents, and find a path forward that presents the best outcome for all.  While I value the passion that accompanies the commitment to ideals, I also believe strongly in the equal application of laws and regulations to all constituents, whether I agree with their position/project/goals or not.
