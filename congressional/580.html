<h3>Background</h3>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
While I have not had a formal role in advocacy work in Colorado, as an author of a nonfiction book, lawyer, and former fertility patient of many years, I participated in advocacy in conjunction with Colorado Fertility Associates and RESOLVE on behalf of the Colorado Family Building Act, which passed last year.  Also, through my long-term service on the board, and particularly as Chair, of Colorado Ballet, I have advocated for the arts in general and for expanding both artistic and audience reach with respect to age, income and ethnic diversity.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have had a long standing interest in government and public service, and have always had a passion for justice.  While my career path has not yet led me to work full time in public service, I have tried to contribute to civic life where I can through board service, pro bono legal work, and volunteering.  I believe that ensuring that districts are drawn fairly and in such a way as to ensure that every vote counts is a fundamental aspect of democracy.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have been a lawyer for nearly twenty-five years and I believe that the majority of my colleagues and clients would say that my greatest asset to them as a lawyer is my negotiating and mediating skills.  I pursued corporate law rather than litigation because I do not like to fight, and I think that most conflict can be resolved by understanding the perspective and goals of the counterparty and trying to reach reasonable compromises.  While I may hold firm views, I generally try to explain and persuade, rather than argue or steamroll.  I have served as a moot court judge, and have experience with weighing facts and arguments and coming to decisions that my not align with my personal views, and I am confident in my ability to be fair and impartial.  In addition, my role as a board chair enhanced my experience in navigating a large board comprised of trustees with a diversity of opinions and political views.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In addition, my role as a board chair enhanced my experience in navigating a large board comprised of trustees with a diversity of opinions and political views.
