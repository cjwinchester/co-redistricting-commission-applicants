<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I currently own and operate four companies: CEO Operating Inc., DHD Services Inc., Turn 2 Us Properties LLC, and Showtime Performance Inc. CEO Operating Inc. contracts to producing companies in the oil and gas industry. My company oversees water facilities, where hydrocarbon is cleaned out of the production water. DHD Services Inc. rents work equipment, mostly trucks, for the oil and gas industry. Turn 2 Us Properties LLC, is a real estate company that buys and fixes homes. Recently, I attained my real estate license and will be working as a realtor for Dynamic Realty. Showtime Performance Inc. is a children&#39;s performance group.

I have taken courses from Colorado Mountain College, including Process Technology and Photovoltaics. 
Colorado Real Estate Broker Certificate.  
Wastewater license class D from the state of Colorado.  
I also have been taking a course in sales for the past year and a half from Sandler Training. This training has greatly improved my communication skills. The Sandler Training sales system is taught at Harvard Business School as part of the curriculum. 


</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81650
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I donated $250 in 2016 to the National Republican Party. I also donated less than $100 to Ben Carson when he was running for President of the United States of America.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I serve in a local congregation as a member of the bishopric. As a member of the bishopric, I help oversee the congregation&#39;s needs. I help to minister to those in need. This is a volunteer position that requires several hours of service each week. One of my assignments is to oversee the youth groups. I work with other adults to help the youth to take on leadership roles to plan and execute weekly activities and gospel lessons.  
I have been involved in my children&#39;s School Accountability Committees. 
My family has been doing foster care. We have been an active foster care family for the last year and a half. In that time, we have taken a 5-day-old baby and reared her to 8 months old. At that point, she was able to return to her parentsâ€™ home. We also have taken care of a 5-year-old boy with Down syndrome. In December, he will have been with us for a year. We have also provided a temporary home for five other children through the foster care system.
I am a member of Western Slope Colorado Oil and Gas Association.
I am a member of Western Garfield County Chamber of Commerce.

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have organized and served meals for our soup kitchens in Rifle and Glenwood Springs. I have spoken at public comment hearings for the Colorado Oil and Gas Commission when there were different rule changes and I wanted my voice to be heard. I have organized service projects in the Rifle area to help needy families. I am also currently involved in organizing a service project for the City of Rifle in conjunction with the Western Slope Colorado Oil and Gas Association. We are going to expand the parking lot for the Rifle Arch Trail. I am the liaison between the two organizations.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have lived in Colorado for 17 years and, in that time, I have grown to love our state! I want to give back where I can. I want to be a voice for the Western Slope. I feel that because we don&#39;t have a huge population, like the Front Range, sometimes we get overlooked. I want to be a part of helping our voices to be heard.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Because of my experience in sales, I believe I have learned to decipher people&#39;s concerns. I believe once you get to the heart of a concern, there are always ways to work through problems to find fair solutions. In the summer of 2016, I served on a jury for a murder trial. I was elected as the foreman of the jury. During our deliberation process, I was able to facilitate discussion from all of the jurors. There were three jurors who were strongly opposed from the other nine jurors. Through the discussion, we all came to the same conclusion. We did this by starting at what we could all agree on and then building from there. We all had to be fair, work within the law and be open with each other. I believe I helped us get general consensus much faster because of the open environment that I helped to create.This is a good example of how I like to work with others. Having an open atmosphere where all feel comfortable discussing opposing opinions is crucial in the decision-making process.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Because of my background in operations, I have an ability to work through a process. I take things one step at a time until I find why something isn&#39;t working. I find that I approach all problems this way. At one time, CEO Operating Inc. had 65 contractors. I managed the employees as well as the customers we served. I was successful in coming up with improved operations upon which everyone could agree. There was a time when my company was responsible to four different production companies. We moved millions of barrels of water each year with very few incidents. In order to accomplish this feat, I had to work with different personalities and ideas.
