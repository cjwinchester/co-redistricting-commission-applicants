</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Donated to the Biden, Hickenlooper, and Democratic Colorado legislator campaigns.  Autumn 2020.  Donated to the American Civil Liberties Association, the NARAL, the Nature Conservancy, and the National Resource Defense Council yearly.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have spent 50+ years as a classroom teacher and professor.  In that capacity I wrote curriculum, created lesson plans and organized over 150 kids per day, included in that were 3 week field trips to Mexico and the Southwest with 15 to 25 students,  and for over 8 years organizing, leading and planning 10 day camping and study of forest ecology with 15 to 50 students at 10,000 feet altitude above Grant Colorado.

I have been a United States Tennis Association league captain for over 20 years taking my teams to District, Sectional and National playoffs.  I have organized tennis play for weekly competition for 25+ years.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I firmly,  and avidly support the &quot;experiment&quot; of our democracy.  Keeping our form of government, a representative democracy, requires constant vigilance.  Presently all western democracies are threatened by authoritarianism.  The very bedrock of our system  is the vote.  I feel very passionately that that franchise needs to be fair and truly representative of the citizenry. I can contribute my analytical abilities and my study of history.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have proven that I can listen, discuss and agree to complicated, contentious, and important hearings and decisions.  After all, I have had a successful career as a classroom teacher for over 40 years.  Everyday required my complete attention to the needs of the pupils, to the concerns of the parents and the community, to decisions made by school administration and to the standards established by state and federal governments.  Sometimes these various aspects were in conflict.  I, as a teacher, learned daily how to include these viewpoints into my vocation. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I receive a doctorate in science (Zoology) from one of the most demanding and rigorous universities.  I have written my thesis, scientific papers and environmental impact statements.  These products require fine detailed analysis of data and only admit logic and reason.  I am firmly committed to finding the best solution, or in this case congressional district configurations totally based on data.  Such data have to include not only numbers, but an understanding of which groups would occupy each district.  There cannot be just one perfect redistricting plan, but there have to be a best plans based on evidence.
