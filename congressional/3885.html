<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not donated money to any campaigns or political organizations.  I choose to vote in every election, written numerous letters and emails to state legislative members both personally and professionally.   Participated in the county caucus.  As a member of a multi-school BOCES, we had updates about the legislature&#39;s procedures from January to May.  Members of the BOCES testified at the legislature about impacts on proposed bills.   Since I served the BOCES with CDE work, I offered input at the Superintendent  Advisory Council meetings where the legislature testimony was discussed.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Member of the Colorado Association of School Board members, Colorado Association of School Administrators, serve as a treasurer for our local church.   Active in the local church, and serve as the Treasurer and Missions Committee Chair, and serve on the Advisory Council.    Long standing member of our local Lion’s Club.  Board member for Pro Colorado, LLC; an organization for landowners who have an oil pipeline crossing them.  
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Serving as a school superintendent in a rural area, yet keenly aware of Colorado Department of Education (CDE)&#39;s roles and responsibilities gave me the opportunity to serve as a liaison in several CDE efforts.  Served on a panel of school superintendents to the Commissioner of Education, served on a panel updating CDE&#39;s School Evaluation system, member of a team using data analysis to rate districts, and served on panel updating the school evaluation system.  I also helped our local Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) by serving on Superintendent&#39;s Advisory Council and designing and teaching classes on School Data Analysis.  
Served on a panel of six Board Members representing landowners on the most recent pipeline project through eastern Colorado.  Served as their Treasurer, but also as a spokesperson and organizer for landowner meetings and our legal counsel.  I prepared written communications with membership, fellow board members, County Commissioners, and legal counsel.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
&quot;An Attitude of Servitude&quot; has always been a high priority for me.  As I researched this appointment, I wondered if there were many rural applicants.  Farming has been in my family for generations and I feel I have many rural contacts that can offer their perspectives on redistricting.  I also have experience in serving on committees with a timeline for reaching a complex goal.  The research required and knowledge gained in this endeavor is appealing to me.   
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Many Problem-Solving strategies are readily available.  I’ve experienced several during my previous committee work and enjoy participating in different models.  Brain storming strategies allow getting all ideas identified, and participants feel heard.  Using the brain storming ideas can be used to find commonalities, potential roadblocks, and priorities.   People who work with me know I will call on the members who have been quiet or not offering any input.  Some issues and conflicts can carry emotional reactions.  Best hopes/worst fears can move the group to look at the emotions in a rational way.  Understanding each other’s background and experiences gives insight into interpretations.  
I also believe summarizing all points brought up lets all see that the solution must cover multiple areas.  Setting priorities allows for a potential ranking to see what the solution(s) must cover.  Reminding participants that no one group may get everything they want, and that the compromises must look equitable from a 360-degree perspective.  When there seems to be a conflict appearing, I remind all of the goal at hand, and the things we have agreed to so far.   This strategy helps to get the mindset of rational thought as our tool to continue.  

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
 &quot;All a problem needs is a good solution!&quot; As a school superintendent, I had my share of upset staff or parents at my door.  My approach was nearly always the same:  I slid my chair around so we all could be together, asks multiple questions to get at the core of the problem, and ask them to help be part of the solution.  Obviously, there were times when emotions ran high, and even confrontation was the start.  No matter what I was exposed to, my response was to be calm, understanding, and rational.  At times, I had to set some parameters so we could continue, then would quickly ask a question about the issue.  There were times when the problem was not the core issue (ex. “The 5 Whys”), and I also identified the emotions triggered in a calm rational way, and summarized to let them know I heard their concerns.   Once their point of view as identified, I may have some historical points I needed to make them aware of.  I let them know I would also have to research into all the other perspectives of this issue, and how I would get back to them.   There are times where individuals have learned Authoritarian techniques.  Again, verbally identifying ineffective strategies usually helps to redirect and refocus the conversation back to a solution.  
“Metacognition” is the term used to describe “Thinking about your own Thinking”, and I strongly agree with it.  In education, we teach students about critical thinking, and Open versus Closed Mindsets.   It has been my experience that there is always more to learn, practice and master to improve communications, yet this work must be done with patience, understanding and commitment.  The reward of reaching a joint solution all can accept is the reward.
