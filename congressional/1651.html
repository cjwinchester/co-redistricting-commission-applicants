        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Ulcca Joshi Hansen</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Ulcca Joshi Hansen
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Ulcca Hansen</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am self-employed as an educational and non-profit consultant.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a BA from Drew University (1998), a PhD from Oxford University (2008) and a JD from Harvard Law School (2010). I was also certified as an elementary and early childhood educator with a special education focus in New Jersey.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80220
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I was raised in a Republican home but began to be active in Democratic politics in 1997 when I worked for then-candidate for City Council in Newark, NJ, Cory Booker. I was active as a member of Democrats Abroad from 2001-2008 when we intermittently lived overseas in the UK and Dubai. Since 2015, Act Blue shows I have donated to Bernie Sanders ($35), Elizabeth Warren ($100), Dan Baer ($50) and the Democratic Senate Campaign Fund ($25). I may have donated to one or two other campaigns directly but can&#39;t recall and don&#39;t have receipts on hand. If I did they would have been small amounts less than $50.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
American Constitution Society, Montclair Neighborhood Association 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As an education and non-profit professional, a large part of my work is advocacy and organization of stakeholder groups. In Colorado my most public engagement in such work was staffing the State Council for Educator Effectiveness (SCEE) from 2010-2011. The governor established the SCEE to deliver recommendations for a statewide educator evaluation system. The legislation was highly contested and the members of the SCEE represented stakeholder groups that were deeply divided in their opinions. In my role I was charged with getting to know the values of the different members; design a process for dialogue and debate informed by experts, data and research, but which also enabled the group to identify and align around shared values. This meant organizing and managing various working groups through which we were able to get the input of community members and advocates for different perspectives. I am proud of the fact that the SCEE provided unanimous recommendations that were recognized nationally for both their content as well as the process that allowed them to emerge. As a trained attorney who has done work in negotiation and mediation, I am committed to the principle that it is usually possible to expand the sphere of shared values and design outcomes that maximize them, even when we also have deeply held personal convictions. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I was very pleased when Colorado approved independent redistricting commissions. I believe a functioning democracy requires a system that meaningfully allows voters to express their desires, and does so in a way that promotes community engagement, debate, the free flow of ideas and the capacity to hold elected officials accountable. This applies to all elected officials. Election cycles over the last two decades have demonstrated what happens when these elements of a democratic system are not functioning properly. Fewer elected officials are in truly competitive races; the cost of campaigns increases; the barriers for new voices and candidates to enter become greater; transparency, accountability and engagement decrease. None of these are healthy. I more closely identify with the overarching values of the Democratic party at this moment in time. However, as a citizen, a mother and a professional I am even more committed to ensuring that we have a democratic republican system that is functional. I believe re-districting is a critical part of making that happen and will require all of us to put principles and values above political affiliation and loyalty.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe highly gerrymandered districts donâ€™t serve the state or nation well. Having said that I am also aware of the need to examine the relative benefits of promoting highly competitive elections; maximizing the number of majority-minority districts; and making districts compact and aligned with existing governance borders. 

I believe it is useful to start by getting members of decision-making entities clear on the goals of their work together, related to one another as people, and aware of the values that are most meaningful to each of them individually or as representatives of a particular stakeholder group. It is also helpful to use research, data and the insight of experts to set or align around the parameters of the work and critical questions that need to be answered. 

I believe I am skilled at building relationships, asking open questions, listening to understand and sitting reasonably well with ambiguity and competing value sets. While I am an active Democrat I believe I can be fair and impartial in this process, recognizing that this process is about ensuring a greater good for the state.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am a trained attorney and one of the most important skills legal training provides is the capacity to think in analytic ways, being divorced from specific outcomes when necessary in order to follow an argument or line of reasoning dispassionately. This is not to say that values and beliefs should not apply to problem-solving. However, the capacity to be intentional about when and how this happens is a skill. Beyond my academic training, the process of analyzing issues and crafting solutions is one I use as a researcher designing projects and processes of evaluation; as well as a consultant supporting clients on projects.
