        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Alexandra Livingston Davis</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Alexandra Livingston Davis
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Aurora Water, Deputy Director Water Resources
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  BA from College; JD from University of Colorado Law School 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80026
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have volunteered to write letters make calls in primary campaigns for Colorado Governor, Senate and House seats.  This year I was the co-chair of my precinct; I have donated to numerous campaigns and political organizations since 11/10/2015 all democratic, mostly in Colorado but including Moveon; South Carolina Senate race, Arizona Senate race and Kentucky senate race.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Colorado Water Trust; the Water Institute Advisory Board
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Most of my volunteer experience organizing and advocating has been with NGO&#39;s or the Boulder County Democratic Party.  in that work, I talked to individuals  and  to groups about the issues; I tried to listen to what was important to them and tie it to the position I was working on.  I helped organize outreach for the Dean Campaign (many moons ago!).  I was also the Assistant Director for DNR under Harris Sherman and Jim Martin.  In that position, we were seeking to resolve complicated water and natural resource problems.  I organized or participated in a number of stakeholder groups.  In those groups, my role included articulating and advocating positions on behalfo; listening and understanding opposing views  and seeking solutions that would work for the stakeholder group.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Districting is hugely important.  We saw the results of what happens when one group makes decisions about district lines in 2010.  Safe seats mean there is no choice, no real debate.  Splitting the opposition basically means you win by cheating.  I think it is hugely important, particularly now with the crazy culture war and division that is going on, to have competitive seats where individuals have to prove themselves to the people and not to the party.  I would like to see districts created that are competitive and require candidates to really communicate with the people in those districts..
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Promoting consensus and creating agreement requires 1. understanding the people at the table- what are their real concerns, fears and desires; 2- listening to people, particularly those with whom you disagree; 3 finding solutions that work for most if not all stakeholders involved.  W/regard to my ability to be fair and impartial.  My background, training and career is based on being objective and using facts/science to solve problems.  I would say that my politics are left of center; because my first rule is &quot;do no harm&quot;.  While I disagree with many of the positions recently espoused by many conservatives; I believe I understand the fears and concerns behind those positions and I can empathize.  I believe at our basest level, most of us want the same end, we just have different ways of getting there.  I believe my ability to self reflect and empathize enables me to be fair.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I trained in law.  I litigated cases for 10 years.  During that time, it was my job to analyze the law, the facts and the issues.  I applied logic and reason to a problem.  To understand the law; how it applied; what alternatives existed and how to argue my reasoning to a judge.  In my tenure at the Dept of Natural Resources and now as a Deputy Director for the Aurora Water Department, I and my team are faced with hugely complex and complicated water supply problems that are exacerbated by climate change, population growth and regional infighting.  These problems require science, engineering, public outreach, stakeholder participation to solve.  I am responsible for bringing solutions to my General Manager and to the City Manager and City Council.  I have to be able to quickly analyzed a suite of solutions with my team and find the one that works best.  I would not be in my position if I was unable to apply logic and reason successfully.     With regard to the letters of recommendation, I would have supplied them but did not know about this opportunity until yesterday.  So I did not have the time to obtain them.
