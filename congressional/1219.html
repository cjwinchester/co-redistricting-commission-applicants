<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Promoting social justice and advocating for others has been a large part of my life. Through my service with Alpine Legal Services, we were able to provide pro bono legal services for the extensive portion of our community who cannot afford legal services. Members of the community have often contacted me to assist them with other non-legal family issues. I have been able to assist them by connecting them with the constituent services of our elected officials, particularly with Senator Bennet&#39;s office dealing with immigration questions. When COVID began, we were very alarmed at the high percentage of Latinos who were contracting COVID in our community. I was able to have 18,000 masks donated and was able to connect the mask distribution with the Food Bank line in Rifle and Glenwood. When our son was enrolled in the Aspen Public Schools from kindergarten through high school I served on many Advisory Committees assisting the schools on many school projects. When it was reported that the Department of Homeland Security was detaining children at the border in cages, I volunteered to help with asylum cases in Texas at the El Paso and McAllen sites. I worked there under the auspices of The Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law and under the American Bar Association&#39;s Pro Bar Legal Project. I am scheduled to continue to work on more asylum cases within the next few weeks.    
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been very involved in politics at many levels, my entire life. I have been a grassroots community organizer for voter registration, phone banks, canvassing and postcard writing. My husband and I have also hosted several hundred political events in our home, some were fundraisers, many were &quot;friendraisers&quot;. We have hosted events for Aspen City Council &amp; Mayoral Candidates and Pitkin County Commissioners as well as state candidates at all levels including the Governors races. We have also hosted events for federal races for congressional, senatorial and Presidential candidates. I have contributed to many candidates and PACs  in Colorado at every level, city, state and federal. I have also contributed to candidates and PACs from other states.  I am attaching two documents which list the campaign contributions which I have made since 2015. I do not keep a list myself but I believe the bulk of my contributions, if not all my contributions are captured on these two lists.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Community service has been an important part of my life ever since I graduated from Law school. For many years, I was Chair of Alpine Legal Services which serves our Roaring Fork Valley from Rifle to Aspen. I am a former Board member of the Aspen Youth Center and of  the Aspen Valley Medical Foundation. I served on several Advisory Committees at the Aspen School District and chaired the successful bond election for the construction of the new Aspen Middle School. I presently serve on the Advisory Board of Aspen Words (Formerly known as the Aspen Writers Foundation) and I am excited to be one of the founding board members of the new Latino Advocacy group, Voces Unidas de las Montañas, where I serve as the Board Chair. I presently serve as Chair of Boldly Forward, a non-profit C4 which is an issues advocacy organization. I have also served on Governor Hickenlooper&#39;s Judicial Performance Commission and Governor Polis&#39; Judicial Nominations Commission. I also served as Co-Chair of Governor Polis&#39; Inaugural Committee.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Colorado is the best state in the union, we are a beacon of hope for the rest of the nation. We strive to organize our institutions to be fair and just. There is an area however, that could use some improvement. Denver is the Capital and has the population concentration of the entire state. The remaining parts of the state are rural and rural resorts. It is understandable that Denver would have an outsized role in our state, however in the interest of fairness, the rest of the state also needs representation. The Western Slope often does not have a big opportunity for input in policy making decisions. Additionally, the Western Slope is becoming more diverse every year and that diversity also needs to be considered. Through my involvement in various philanthropic activities and civic and political organizations, I have learned a great deal about the communities of the Western Slope and I would like to bring some of my experience and knowledge of the area into the discussions of the Redistricting Commission.    
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am the eldest of five children, building consensus and creating agreement was a mater of survival. Later, when I was in college, creating consensus was the best way to get your group project finished and submitted on time. Later, as I served on numerous boards, I learned that consensus building definitely made you a more effective board member. I consider myself a compassionate person. One of the basic characteristics of a compassionate person is to be fair and balanced. Being fair is also associated with being just, which is a trait found in thoughtful lawyers. Being fair and just to others is a goal I strive to meet every day. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Developing your analytical skills and applying logic and reason to a problem was critical to being a successful law student. These skills were used throughout your assignments and exams. It has been my experience that once you are trained as a lawyer, your approach to your life changes. My law school training has taught me to approach most projects and problems in a certain step by step methodical way in order to complete the task or to achieve a solution. It is just second nature.
