<h3>Background</h3>

<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I feel that I am a unique candidate in that each day in my job I lead and manage a complex business operation. However, my interests and community engagement have extended well beyond my company.

These include but are not limited to: supporting the technology industry in Colorado via long term board involvement in of the Colorado Technology Association, efforts to educate women and minority students- with an emphasis on science and technology, economic development efforts that support Denver and Colorado, training and mentoring in the entrepreneurial and innovation communities, efforts to improve the quality of health care in Colorado and manage costs, and important philanthropic contributions aimed at supporting under served communities and our environment. In short, I have consistently donated money, time and the important value of my network to support our Colorado Community in a broad and generous manner. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>

I donated money to the following candidates: Hillary Clinton in 2016, Phil Weiser in 2018, and Michael Hancock in 2018 in amounts at or below  $1000/candidate.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The redistricting function is a crucial part of ensuring that our political process is fair and that public resources are fairly distributed. As I have strong science and math background I believe that I have a solid aptitude to understand data and apply this to fostering sound recommendations for how district boundaries are determined. My fundamental ethic is to be collaborative, well informed, have integrity and to act in the best interest of the broader community rather than myself. I would bring this dedication to this role. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I would start with my ability to review information from a scientific and objective view. Engineers are trained to understand numbers and data and then to derive a story from that information- not the reverse. I would appeal to the fact that biases today can create problems down the road. But mostly, I believe that FOR ANY ORGANIZATION OR CAUSE THAT A PERSON WOULD DONATE THEIR TIME TO, THE ORGANIZATION COMES FIRST. In this case, it is about the State of Colorado and how this commission can come together with recommendations that are fair to ALL Coloradoans- not a particular party. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My college degree in Chemical Engineering required 2 full years of advanced calculus. In addition, the entire curriculum reinforces the &#39;scientific method&#39; for analysis and problem solving. This background has been reinforced in my role of running a technology services company. This has required objective and creative approaches to solve complex technology problems, working with people to take action and at the same time inspiring their dedication.  I am confident in my intellectual aptitude to analyze, understand and communicate the story that the data is suggesting.
