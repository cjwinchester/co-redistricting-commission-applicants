<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My political activity began in 1968, when I was a freshman at CSU, Ft. Collins.  I became a member of an organization called “YES for Colorado,”  which stood for  Youth Extension of Suffrage.  It was affiliated with the Colorado Collegiate Association, and we advocated for the 18 year-old vote.  I was not old enough to vote in that election, but I realized how important it was that young men and women who were being asked to risk their lives serving their country in Vietnam be allowed a say in who was leading our country, and making decisions that would affect them directly.   It took three more years for the 26th Amendment to pass, but ever since then I have been an advocate for young people participating in the electoral process.
I have donated modest amounts to political campaigns in the past few years, many of them cash donations, and all were for $25.00 or less.  Those donations went to Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, and Bri Buentello.  I have also donated to the National Women’s History Museum and the Poor People’s Campaign.  As a member of Colorado WINS – the union for state employees - I also contribute to a PAC.  

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Since November of 2015, I have belonged to several organizations, although I am currently working full time, and up until last month was raising two of my grandchildren.  I am a member of PFLAG, and I am very involved in Disaster Response Organizations – both religious and secular.  Through the United Methodist Church, I am a member of the Emergency Response Team, which works closely with UMCOR, the United Methodist  Committee on Relief, to help in Disasters.  I am also a trainer for the Pueblo Behavioral Health Response Team, and was activated with my team from the state hospital to respond to the Beulah and Junkins wildfires in 2016. I am also a member of the Medical Reserve Corps in Pueblo, and have recently  volunteered on weekends to help with contact tracing for COVID-19.
I was a member of the CoVOAD (Colorado Voluntary Organizations Active in Disasters) Disaster Spiritual Care Steering Committee, which organized the Disaster Spiritual Care Program for Colorado.  I am also a Disaster Spiritual Care Provider for the Red Cross, and was one of the first Disaster Spiritual Care Responders to assist with the Spring Fire in La Veta in 2017. I was the co-chair of the Co-worker’s Assistance Team at CMHIP for 10 years, and I was also a member of the Employee Management Committee.  For two years, I was a member of the State Employee Recognition Committee, serving on the Work/Life Balance subcommittee.  I am also a member of the Employee Management Committee, which involves representing the employees at CMHIP, and working with the administration to help promote communication and cooperation.

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have been involved in nonviolent demonstrations supporting Black Lives Matter, calling for racial justice after the deaths of George Floyd and Brianna Taylor, among others. I have also been involved in demonstrations opposing the separation of families at our southern border.
As I have already demonstrated, my work involves advocating for religious minorities at the state mental hospital, and I have helped patients outside of my regular work schedule to participate in the worship rituals and practices of Indigenous peoples and Buddhists.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
In 1968, I dropped out of college in March, in order to campaign for Senator Eugene McCarthy, Democratic peace candidate for the Presidency. I worked in three state primaries, and was a page for the Colorado Delegation to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, IL.  I received a crash course in American politics during that time!
I traveled across the country, literally working from Los Angeles to New York City.  During this time, I developed a deep appreciation for the people of this country – sitting in coffee shops or in living rooms and around kitchen tables, discussing the issues that affected them, and their hopes and dreams for this nation. 
There has been a great deal of water under the bridge since those days; and yet, the perspective I gained through those early conversations strengthened my belief in the citizens of this country and deepened my commitment to help ensure equal access to participation in the electoral process.
This experience also taught me the importance of a fair and impartial redistricting process.  One of the complaints I heard expressed, in every state where I worked, was that gerrymandering prevented folks from having a voice in the legislative process, and that their perspectives were silenced or ignored as a result.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
For over 9 years, I worked as a Volunteer Staff Chaplain in Colorado Prisons.  This experience led me to study Restorative Justice, an approach to criminal activity that tries to get to the roots of the crime and heal all who were affected by it.  It gives a voice to the victim(s), which the legal system does not, and allows them to describe the impact of the crime on their lives and determine what amends, if possible, the offender needs to make.  The emphasis is on healing, for all parties involved.  As a part of this approach, I was trained in Victim Offender Mediation.  I have completed several successful mediations, mostly for minor offenses, but in one case, for a more serious felony.  In each of these cases, I worked with either the victim(s) or the offender(s), in order to prepare them for the possible meeting.  While I have worked with both victims and offenders, I need to be clear that the victim(s) drives this process, and at each step of the way, they determine whether the process continues or not.    
If the meeting does occur, there are always 2 mediators – one who works with victims and one for the offenders.  This helps each group feel supported in this process, and allows the mediators to maintain civil discourse.  There is no agenda except to create a safe space for both parties to talk.  I believe that this experience would be helpful in the work of creating new districts.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am an ordained United Methodist Minister, and until I retire at the end of this month, have served as the Director of the Spiritual Care Department at CMHIP, the state mental hospital in Pueblo.  In this position, I facilitate the religious and spiritual practices of patients and staff at the mental hospital.  I also facilitate outside clergy visits, and schedule spiritual and religious services.  I enjoy meeting with patients (prior to COVID-19) and helping with their religious needs.  Sometimes, this means working with staff to help them understand the requirements of religious and spiritual traditions that are not Christian, and advocating for the patient.
Three years ago, there was a patient who was a Sikh, and as part of his religious belief, was required to wear a turban.  Most turbans are at least 9-18 feet long, and are wound around the person’s head.  A piece of cloth this long is a security risk, as it could be used for hanging or as a weapon, so the staff on this unit were understandably opposed to the request.  However, I was able to get the patient to agree to use a tee shirt instead of a long piece of cloth.  Then I had to work with the staff, who were still opposed to the head covering, in spite of the fact that every patient on that unit had the same article of clothing in their possession.  Using this conflict as an educational opportunity, I did a short class for the staff on Sikh practices and beliefs, and ended with a couple of examples of lawsuits where Sikh turbans were not allowed.  Both of those lawsuits favored the protection of a sincerely held religious practice.  The staff decided that the tee shirt was acceptable, and both sides were happy.
This is one example of how I apply logic and reason, and empathy to solve a problem.  There are many similar situations that take place in my line of work, and my job is to balance safety and security with varied and unfamiliar religious or spiritual practices.
