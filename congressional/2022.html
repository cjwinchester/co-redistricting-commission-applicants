<h3>Background</h3>

<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>

Pete Buttigieg $10 2020
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
President and Co-Founder of Colorado Food Truck Association: Sept 2019-Present
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
After testifying in favor of a Colorado State Bill in April of 2019 to make the licensing process for food trucks less cumbersome for the industry, I attended several stakeholder meetings throughout the summer as a representative of the food trucks to negotiate with municipalities, counties, health departments, and fire departments across the state. It became very apparent throughout these meetings that our industry was not being taken seriously. As a result, a fellow industry member and I began to organize a trade group for the food truck industry. We currently have 75+ members. We also worked separately to create a statewide fire code checkoff that all fire dept across the state would recognize. We are on the cusp of presenting this to the Colorado Fire Marshalls Association to get them on board. Unfortunately, Covid has slowed the rapid progress we were initially making tremendously. We are planning to pick up the charge as soon as having in person meetings becomes a reality again.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have always been more interested in policy than politics. I want every citizen to feel like their vote counts and can&#39;t think of a better way to promote that than to draw fair district lines. I also feel that my educational background and my experience makes me uniquely qualified for the commission. I have the analytical background having a BS in Mathematics and 8 years of working experience in the field. I have the policy and political understanding necessary for the commission between my Public Policy coursework, my experience working for a lobby firm in Colorado and also covering an entire legislative session for a local news channel as well. Additionally, my coursework has included a few GIS classes, so I am vaguely familiar with map making as well.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
One of my skills in life has always been to be able to find the middle ground. From a young age I was a mediator. I honed these skills when I taught and throughout the various other careers I&#39;ve had. Most recently, I successfully worked with the Colorado Fire Marshall&#39;s to create consensus among themselves and food truck businesses statewide to create a checkoff that we all could abide by and use in each jurisdiction in the state. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am an analytical person. Not only do I have a degree in Mathematics, but I also taught the subject as well. Additionally, I worked as a mathematician for nearly 5 years. During all of this time, I was honing my analytical skills, teaching others how to use logic and reason to solve a problem, and doing the same myself. 
Each problem that I encounter I approach in an analytical way.
