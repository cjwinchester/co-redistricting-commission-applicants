<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
With my working career ending in 2018, I have become more involved in the Irish/American community and begun laying the groundwork for supporting mental health and preventing suicides in young people. This past summer, one of my interns from Northern Ireland was going to be assigned to a mental health support with the City of Broomfield when the pandemic cancelled those plans. My long term focus is to have this be a Colorado and Northern Ireland collaborative outreach to young people.  
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Many years ago, in the 1980&#39;s, I was Chairman of the Speaker&#39;s Committee for the Republican Party in Va. Beach, VA. I attended their state convention and helped organize get out the vote in my community. As the party became more polarized, and I moved to Colorado in 1990, I dropped out of active participation and began voting Democratic. I have not been active in any party since I moved here. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am the Colorado Coordinator for Project Children and have been for more than twenty years. This non-profit, HQ in New York, has been engaged in peace and reconciliation efforts in Northern Ireland for more than forty-five years, fostering ways to bring Catholic and Protestant children, and now university students, to find common ground. Our leader, Denis Mulcahy, a former NYPD Bomb Squad detective, has twice been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. 

I am also on the board of directors for the non-profit, Mile High Writers Group. An organization that helps writers improve their work and support efforts to become published authors.   
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Decades of gerrymandering by our two political parties have brought American&#39;s to the realization this is not healthy for our democracy. Local and state alignments should be competitive and not &quot;safe&quot; districts as this leads our elected officials to become detached from being more closely connected to the needs of their constituents.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have been a life-long student of this country&#39;s history and that of my mother&#39;s home country, Ireland. Additionally, I have participated in finding, and providing for, common ground for young people to break down their walls of religious and political separation so they can build a more equitably functioning society. As in the negotiations of the Good Friday Agreement, led by Senator George Mitchell and later implemented by our own former State Department liaison, Jim Lyons, the key to any process of this importance is determining common understanding of terminology used by all interested parties. This lays the foundation for effective dialogue and negotiations. I have no interest in seeing this state, or country, reach the point where we no longer trust or have confidence in our elected officials. If we align our districts in a more competitive way and will draw greater participation from our citizens to participate in the process of the selecting candidates for office.     
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Recognizing a problem exists is the first step. This commission is that first step. The process is then determining a desired outcome to resolve the problem and the road to take to reach that point. Reaching the summit of all of Colorado&#39;s fourteen thousand foot mountains is not a straightforward process. Having achieved this feat, I learned along the way how to navigate where there was no clear path using a combination of assessment of the slope and whether it was attainable. If not, regroup and try another path. This metaphor reflects my ability to see a challenge, pay attention to the environment, test hypothesis, and focus on the task at hand. In a social situation, listening to the other person and determining what is actually being said, is critical to finding common ground. As the attached letters and my resume highlight, this is one of my strengths.
