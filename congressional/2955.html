<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My political activity, before and since 10 November 2015, has been writing to my representatives and voting in local, state, and federal elections. Before 2015, my political activity included membership in the League of Women Voters, including being an officer at the local level.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
* President, Secretary and board member, Spring Creek Homeowner&#39;s Association, 2006 to 2013

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I grew up in Colorado. In the 1980s, I joined the League of Women Voters and participated in voter service activities at the local level in Sterling, Colorado, as well as in various studies, including water and economic development in the Sterling area. When my husband&#39;s Navy career finally brought us home to Colorado, I participated in the HOA in which we lived, becoming a board member, the Secretary, and then President of its Board, which gave me the opportunity to re-engage with Colorado political life and hands-on experience with governance issues in El Paso County. Our HOA was participating in Neighborhood Watch, worked with drainage and access issues with the City of Colorado Springs, and won our request for a guardrail to be installed to prevent further incidents of cars hurtling through fences. I worked on Fort Carson and learned about the intersection of the military community with Colorado Springs and Pueblo. Then I returned to college to earn my MSW so that I could work with the population here on mental health issues as a provider of care. I have been doing this work since graduation in 2012. I attend CCHA&#39;s community meetings for improvement of services for the Medicaid population as often as I can. I also provide internship for MSW students in this community to help ensure that there are a sufficient number of mental health providers trained and working here to meet community needs.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Since I first began paying attention to the way that we choose our representatives in the 1980s, I have been interested in studies, proposals, and legislation about redistricting, and the obstacles and struggles around ensuring that redistricting in our state was done in a fair and nonpartisan manner that allows every citizen an equally represented voice. It would be an honor to participate in this task as part of the Independent Redistricting Commissions.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I know there is always more than one way to achieve any goal, that it is usually possible to achieve consensus when the people involved are able to talk frankly and respectfully -- to listen and to consider fully everyone&#39;s opinions and concerns -- and that creativity is required to find solutions that are acceptable to a majority of the people in our state. I am willing to listen, to consider, to participate in developing solutions, and in presenting them to the people of this state.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
By education, I am a critical thinker and able to work with statistics, demographics, census data, interpreting and applying the knowledge from social science studies. I know my state and the divisions between the rural areas and the metropolitan areas, military and civilian, class and race divisions. I have training and experience in facilitation of groups as well as in mediation.
