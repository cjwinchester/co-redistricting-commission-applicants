        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Alyssa Evans</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Alyssa Evans
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Policy Researcher at Education Commission of the States
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in economics from the University of Denver and a master&#39;s degree in international law and public policy from the American University of Paris.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80113
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I first got involved in politics by interning and then working for a local nonprofit (New Era Colorado) to register young people to vote. I have since interned on a senate campaign (Mark Udall, 2014), interned for a state representative (Dan Pabon), worked on the 2016 Colorado Democratic Party coordinated campaign and worked as a state legislative aide for Jeff Bridges while he was a state representative during the legislative sessions in 2017 and 2018. I have previously donated to Planned Parenthood and Amnesty International in the past couple of years. In 2020, I donated to Jeff Bridges&#39; campaign for state senator, to Elizabeth Warren&#39;s presidential primary campaign, and I made a split donation to racial justice organizations including Fair Fight Action, Know Your Rights Camp, Black Voters Matter Fund, National Bail Out, The National Police Accountability Project, Campaign Zero, Black Lives Matter Support Fund at Tides Foundation, Higher Heights for America, ColorofChange Education Fund, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Unicorn Riot, Advancement Project, and BYP100 AF. I also recently volunteered for a &#39;no&#39; campaign for a ballot measure (No on 115). 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I do not belong to any specific political, civic, or community organizations. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I started organizing with New Era Colorado to register and turn out young voters. This formative experience motivated me to pursue additional campaign and public policy work to inform voters and advocate for progressive policies that I believe help protect the rights of marginalized people, promote equality, and protect our environment. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I would like to serve on this commission to protect the fairness of our election system. I strongly believe the independent redistricting commission can help to ensure that congressional district lines are fairly drawn and not gerrymandered in favor of one party or another. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that it is sincerely in the best interests of the commissioners to come to a fair agreement for the benefit of all Coloradans. Fair representation of all people in our state in the U.S. Congress is critical to the well-being of our citizens. To that end, if I&#39;m selected to serve as a commissioner, I would work to bring about a fair consensus among commissioners to ultimately serve the best interests of all Coloradans. I have previously worked for a nonpartisan nonprofit primarily focused on empowering people to vote and I continue to be dedicated to that cause. I also currently work for a nonpartisan organization that provides neutral and unbiased information and advice to policymakers about education policy because it is in the best interests of students to work with and inform education policymakers across the political spectrum. I have spent several years being impartial and fair in my work and I would apply this same skill and ethic to my work on the commission if selected. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have a degrees in economics and public policy for which I have had to develop strong analytical and reasoning skills. In my current profession, I read and analyze academic studies, data, and other information to inform my work. I am diligent about researching problems or issues to be thoroughly informed before making decisions.
