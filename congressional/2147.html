</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I live in a district which I believe does not fully represent the interests of my community based on the unresponsiveness of my elected congressional representative.  That does not belie a particularly political point of view, but rather describes the need to ensure that drawn districts provide representation to their citizens.  Much of my residence in Colorado has been in it&#39;s more rural areas, and I am interested in ensuring that rural Coloradans are not ignored in the redistricting process.  From a personal point of view, after a wonderful few years of full retirement, I feel a personal need to engage in, and bring my experience to, a wider public engagement.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My entire career experience has been to seek solutions to thorny problems of all types...policy, administrative, and interpersonal.  Much of this work involves seeking out the basis of disagreement, defining underlying problems, and working toward agreement.  Working at the senior level of the Federal government required constant consensus building, the ability to act as mediator, and an extraordinary ability to listen, evaluate, and consider opposing points of view.  I am an excellent listener, able to draw people into conversations, ensure all points of view can be heard, and assisting others in coming to consensus.  I have had extensive experience in working with senior managers, including senior military officers, and helping them to reach agreements or consensus.  I have served on management teams successfully negotiating nationwide labor agreements - an activity requiring all of the skills I have described above.  Achieving a successful outcome in these negotiations requires the ability to maintain a congenial atmosphere, be transparently fair, and be a consensus builder.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I find this requirement particularly difficult to describe.  My analytical skills are reflected in my career success.  In service as Deputy or Chief of Staff to two major Federal agencies, I clearly needed and successfully demonstrated problem solving skills, which are based on the ability to analyze, apply logic and reason, and reach conclusions.  This includes rooting out the real problems to be solved, which are not those that are often presented.  Success in these positions requires thoroughly understanding the background of specific issues, and anticipating the consequences, both intended and unintended, of proposed solutions.  It requires the ability to reach logical conclusions, based on facts.  It requires the ability to put aside, and to help others recognize and put aside, emotional reactions, false information, and personal opinions in reaching consensus.  It can require calling out personal gain or favor, either for oneself or others.  These attributes all require strong analytical skills, logic, reason, and courage.  I have all of the characteristics.
