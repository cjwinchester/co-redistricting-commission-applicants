        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Jeri Lane Sampson</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Jeri Lane Sampson
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Jeri Lane Shine, Jeri Lane Knobbe</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am retired. My most recent job was as a computer programmer at Crawford Technologies, Inc (Toronto CA working remotely) from 2012-2019. Before that I worked at IBM and a spinoff for 33 years (1979-2012). I can get you a resume if you want it but that&#39;s about it! And nothing relevant to a political job.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a BS in Computer Science from Iowa State University (1979). I was a co-author of 4 US patents during my time with IBM, mainly having to do enhancements to IBM&#39;s Advanced Function Presentation architecture. I received a designation of Electronic Document Professional in 2012 from Xplor International (https://xplor.org/edp-certification-program/).
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80004
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Most of the organizations that I am interested in belonging to have to do with protecting the environment. I have been involved in many organizations as a member, but haven&#39;t held office with any of them.  I have been especially active since retiring in April 2019. I was a volunteer coordinator with Seniors Outdoors and Softball for a Cure, which involved both getting people to sign up for jobs and making sure they were done on time.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Since 2015 I have donated money to campaigns for Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, John Hickenlooper, Michael Bennet, Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, Rachel Zenzinger, Brianna Titone, and probably others that I can&#39;t remember. None of these donations have been more than $50 at a time. Also Act Blue, Jeffco Dems, La Plata county Democrats, and Team GiveGreen. I don&#39;t know if these qualify as political but: EarthJustice, Environment Colorado, Save the Boundary Waters, and NRDC.  I am pretty sure that I&#39;ve been registered as a Democrat since 2015 but, I may have been Unaffiliated for part of that time.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
In the past 5 years I have belonged to and/or volunteered with Arvada Community Table, La Plata County Open Space, Vote Forward, Sierra Club, Conservation Colorado, Seniors Outdoors (Durango CO), Rocky Mountain Ukulele Orchestra, Xcel Energy day of action, Softball for a Cure (Boulder CO), Citizens Climate Lobby, and Arvadans for Progressive Action.   I was appointed to the Arvada Parks Advisory Committee this past May (a volunteer 3 year position). 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I think the commission is doing important work because BOTH parties have taken advantage of redistricting to serve their own needs every time there is an election. The districts for voting should be based on divisions of the population that make geographic sense, not political. I believe that each district should be able to elect representatives based on the needs of the people who live there and not by drawing crazy boundaries.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
When I was working at IBM my job for many years was as a technical team leader (as well as a programmer). I have quite a bit of experience in dealing with people who have different backgrounds and with different age groups. I am also a parent to two successful women and as everyone knows, raising kids requires a lot of guidance and compromise. I know how to listen to all sides of a question before making a decision. I feel that I am a reasonable, thoughtful, and fair person. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Being a computer programmer is an exercise in logic. I like to compare it to solving word problems. I am a very logical thinker, which led to my successful career of 40 years in that industry. Most of my career was spent doing program development and fixing customer issues. Maintenance programming consists of using logic to listen to the customer problem and thinking about what may be causing it in the code. You need to be able to approach a problem in a logical manner, identify possible causes, and eliminate them until the correct issue is found and fixed. Logic and reason are what it&#39;s all about!

I can get you some letters of recommendation if you need them but since I&#39;m retired, I don&#39;t really who to ask or what type of letter you want. Please let me know if you do need these and more about what kind of recommendation you are looking for.
