<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Throughout my life and professional career, I have been an advocate for the underserved, underrepresented and oppressed.   As a person of color, I am sensitive to the issues of equity and fairness.  During my time as a college student, I helped to organize college students that provided a voice to Latino students.  As a community member I have created new activities that strengthened our LMAC and its standing in our community.  Recently I was key member in fighting for social justice within our community on behalf of a migrant that had been beaten.  We had several meetings with local officials and District Attorney.  We are advocating a change of procedures when a non-English speaker is involved in an incident involving law enforcement.  As a community member I was co-chair of a group that created the CUBRES program within UNC. CUBRES was designed to be supportive of students of color for college success. When I sat a member of the YMCA advisory, I encouraged more outreach to families that were challenged finically and more families are now being served.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am a Colorado native and I love this state. As a school administrator and teacher I dedicated my self to a life of service. A life of service to family, community and especially youth.  Through the commission, I will continue this dedication of service.  Additionally, working on this commission I will represent and serve Colorado&#39;s populations that are underserved and underrepresented.  Maps that are fair and equally represent &quot;all&quot; residents of Colorado is important 
 to me from many aspects.  For one, people that know and feel like they count and have representation have a greater potential to become involved in our democracy. When boundaries are done fairly, elected officials are more likely to truly represent all their constituents.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Provide a statement about how you believe you will promote consensus or contribute to creating agreement among the commissioners. Please also discuss your ability to be fair or impartial. 
Since I was a child fairness has always been a part of my personal profile and it has always pained me to see someone being treated unfairly. Equity and consensus building are key elements in any good leaders.  People will not listen or follow if they do not believe they are being treated fairly. Fairness and impartiality are showing respect for fellow citizens and any process.  I pride myself in my how I conduct myself in my professional world and my private life. It is how we treat each other that matters most. A primary ingredient in reaching agreement is showing others that they are being heard. This action shows others that the element of respect.  Respect and fairness go hand in hand when working with others.   
As an educator I know that we all learn differently.  Children that are special needs must be provided more time or special assistance to get to the objective, just as all the other students reach the objective following a different path of learning.  This is fair and just. Also, when there was a decision to be made I always try to include others to give staff, students and parents a voice and a path to be part of the solution.
