<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My purpose in applying for the Commission is to work to assure the election process in Colorado is fair, balanced and allow all those entitled to vote have a voice in creating districts that fairly represent their communities in order to strengthen our democratic process in Colorado elections.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I will engage actively to gather all relevant information/data and input to allow me to study and understand the parameters of the role to allow me to talk with and share insights and understanding with fellow commissioners offering ideas, options and encourage open dialogue.  I will listen to community members and their input from their perspective, giving full respect for all ideas, opinions and recommendations  and give my ideas and perspectives to the commission based on my analysis and reasons for consideration of recommended action.  My purpose would be to work in a collaborative process in development of options and the best solutions for the greatest good with commission members.  My approach would be without pre-defined conclusions and open to all options for thoughtful, rational development of solutions that would assure a fair and impartial involvement and outcome.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My experience over the last 45 years in business, as a volunteer and in education developed a balanced fact based decision making process integrated with all salient factors from others, both expert and experienced, that allows for proper weighting of key variables and full consideration of expected and unexpected outcomes to arrive at a reasoned and balanced approach.  For me the problem solving end game would be to have the best solution for the most people and be able to communicate and share the &#39;why&#39; and &#39;how&#39; the decisions were made to constituents or other interested parties.  Education and work experience involved significant analytics as a researcher in the academic environment and as a business leader making decisions based on extensive data driven analysis balanced with weighted input of more subjective variables.  Skills have been developed to chart the best path forward with full consideration of all factors with a goal to develop, not a perfect answer or solution (I do not believe their is a perfect solution), but the best option(s) developed through the analysis, discussion and critical stress testing of the process.
