<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I was an aide to Claire Levy in the Colorado House in 2009. I have donated to the primary campaign for Bernie Sanders, the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, and the presidential campaign of Barack Obama. I may have donated to Joe Neguse&#39;s campaign for Congress (he is a law school colleague and friend). I am a passionate and regular voter, have participated in door-knocking and phone banking for Presidential campaigns.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I was a member of the Colorado Bar Association and Denver Bar Association through 2019. I have participated sporadically in neighborhood organizations including the Tennyson Berkeley Business Association, the Berkeley Regis United Neighborhood group, and the Highland United Neighborhood association. I am currently a member of Historic Denver.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My real estate office is a member of the Tennyson Berkeley Business Association and I&#39;ve spent time representing my business and community in participation there. The association works to bring the businesses and community in the Berkeley/Regis neighborhoods together for the betterment not just of the commercial enterprises, but of the community as a whole. I regularly participate in community events such as cocoa-and-cookie giveaways at the holidays and similar events. I host twice-yearly fundraisers for local and other charitable organizations, including food drives for Bienvenidos Food Bank, clothing and other items for The Gathering Place, drives for the Family Tree, among others. In the past, I created a support group for single-mother refugees from Liberia in Aurora to connect them to community and services, and volunteered with the Red Cross.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am proud of Colorado for being a leader in the nation, creating an impartial redistricting commission. In my time working for the Colorado Secretary of State and for a State Legislator, I have seen the Colorado elections and political systems working up close, but the system of redistricting as it exists in most places in this country is seriously flawed as it is controlled by whichever political party happens to have power at the time of redistricting. This new, non-partisan redistricting system can be a model for the nation, and will allow voters in Colorado to have a more equal voice as districts are re-drawn to be more fair and balanced, and not just to favor one party. I am a Colorado native and since working for the Secretary of State have admired the fact that when it comes to elections, Colorado is a strong leader and ever striving to be better, and is one that other states look to for guidance. It would be my honor to serve as a member of the Commission to usher in this new, better era of congressional map-drawing that I believe, like our elections system, will become a model for other states.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that every one of us has a voice that should be heard, and that in our political system, we make our voices heard through our votes. I also believe that there can be productive dialogue between those who do not agree, and that by offering each other a forum to be heard but where others truly listen, we as a community can cast the most informed votes for the things we believe will make our community a better place. We do not all agree, however, and I think it is important that we also understand that voting (and similarly, voicing opinions in a forum such as the commission) is not a zero-sum game. I am able to give credence to the opinions of others in circumstances where I do not share those opinions, because I believe that our diversity of opinion is what makes us a vibrant community. To promote consensus, I will listen – actively and with an open mind – and I will share my opinions expecting the same of others. I will approach redistricting with an understanding that there need not be winners or losers, but that everyone will have to give and take, myself included. 
A belief in being fair or impartial is a large reason I made the career change from law to real estate. In litigation, there are winners and losers, and in the litigation work I did for the Jefferson County Attorney&#39;s Office, I found this to be the hardest part of my job. I am not naturally inclined to want one side to prevail at the expense of another, and I thrive in an environment where I can collaborate with others to reach an outcome that is satisfactory to all. This requires give and take and approaching problems with a sense of what is most equitable.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In law school, you are taught to &quot;think like a lawyer.&quot; This means to think critically and analytically. Problems are approached differently in the law. While there might be passion involved in lawyering, a good lawyer truly analyzes the facts to reach the &quot;best&quot; answer. In working for the Secretary of State, I collaborated with Legislative Legal Services to create legislation that attempted to solve some conflicts between state law and the Colorado Constitution. This requires working within the limitations of the Constitution, which is not easily modified (in particular when trying to convince voters to adopt language that is merely arcane technical change to the law), and therefore requires thinking critically about the ways in which the constitution interacts with state law and in which &quot;fixes&quot; can be made from only one end of the equation.
If levity is appropriate, I would also add that this question instantly made me think of the LSAT – which purports to elucidate just this skill!
