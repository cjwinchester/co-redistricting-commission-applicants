<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
As a professional project and program manager responsible for the Rocky Mountain Region of the USFS&#39; environmental cleanup program, my work in creating and managing partnerships and managing relationships with local, state and federal agencies to clean up abandoned mines and preplan and coordinate for hazardous materials release emergencies is ongoing.  In the interagency Regional Response Team, I represent the USFS and US Department of Agriculture.  Under my guidance, the USFS continues to partner with various State (CDPHE, CDRMS, CGS &amp; others), federal (US EPA, US DOE, US DoJ, DOI (including BLM and NPS) to address remediation of abandoned hardrock mines throughout Colorado.  At home, both as a BM HOA board member and citizen of the Bear Mountain neighborhood, I shared my 20+ years of experience as a volunteer firefighter, red-carded wildland firefighter and emergency response manager at both federal and local levels to advocate for FIREWISE implementation in  our neighborhood.  This included collaboration with neighbors, local fire department, and Jefferson County staff to include a strong focus on mitigating ingress/egress routes for one-way-in neighborhoods, as well as establishing emergency access easements across private property for both ingress/egress and &quot;safe zones&quot; to be used during fires.  In the past, I&#39;ve also served as chief steward of a (non-partisan) federal employee union (SFGE - American Federation of Government Employees), representing federal employees at the Rocky Flats site to the Department of Energy - in both union and employee negotiations.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
While I vote every year since eligible at age 18, the last time I ran for any &quot;office&quot; was in college (1986-1987; elected student body president (non-partisan, student election) at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor campus).  I have attended several marches and rallies (mostly in Colorado) since that time.  Without exception, these demonstrations have been non-partisan/issue-based.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
PMP certification (Project Management Professional, expired); AARP; NARFE (National Assoc. or active and retired federal employees); BMHOA (Bear Mountain Home Owners Assoc. board member); AAA Colorado; Rocky Mountain Region Employees Association (USFS); Bear Mountain CWPIP (Community wildfire protection implementation plan) committee
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My goal in serving on this commission stems from a desire to  re-engage in meaningful public work to focus on rebalancing the influence of individual citizens with the long-accrued power of the two dominant political parties.  In my view, both Democratic and Republican parties have become too self-serving in a way that seeks to concentrate and solidify political power instead of representing their citizens&#39; membership with an intent to govern responsibly.  One of the approaches that the parties have taken is to seek to gerrymander various systems to favor their party interests at the expense of individual citizens.  Colorado voters recognize this tendency and are seeking to re-balance the fairness of elections via this redistricting effort.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a long-term, Independent voter, I&#39;ve always sought to find candidates that represent the best interests of the people of Colorado.  Generally, this has meant voting based on a variety of beliefs, positions and issues rather than voting based on party ideology.  I believe that all citizens and, in part, political parties, seek to maintain Colorado as a national leader in effective governance.  Building from this common belief, the commission can work to balance citizen and party priorities by ensuring fair elections based on a fair demarcation that does not favor any political party.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In my day job cleaning up abandoned mine sites and improving surface water quality, I&#39;ve designed and implemented environmental sampling plans.  Use of this data, coupled with stakeholder involvement (those effected by project  performance and outcomes) drives the site characterization and, therefore, the cleanup decisions.   This work includes presentation and analysis of data, as well as use of GIS to communicate the data and what it tells us about the site and anticipated changes to future water quality.
