<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the commission with the hope to demonstrate that my passion, commitment, experience, and skills will contribute to ensuring  Colorado rural communities will be equally represented and continue to be great places to work, recreate, raise families and live. I am highly intrigued and thrilled this opportunity is available.
I have chosen a career, which feeds my lifelong desire to help others and give back to the community. In 2017, I completed my Masters in Social Work with a concentration on Integrated Community Practice from the University of New England. The Integrated Community Practice concentration incorporated not only clinical and mental health components; it also included advanced practice skills in the areas of program and policy development, political advocacy, and community practice particularly with rural populations.
 I am dedicated to serving my community and looking to expand my professional and political experience while being a fierce advocate for rural Colorado. I see serving on the commission as a positive way to complete that task. I would be honored to play a part in these efforts by contributing my unique skills, experience, and passion to the commission. I would greatly appreciate your consideration for this position, and I look forward to the possibility of speaking more in person.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a social worker, I consistently practice the principles of empathy, respect, and fairness with my clients, community stakeholders, colleagues, and court officials. By practicing these principles has provided me with a better understanding of where others may be coming from which has led to better outcomes and professional working relationships.  These skills have been critical in positively working with those with opposing views. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a social worker, I have had to utilize an array of analytical skills and logical reasoning in difficult and challenging situations with families in crisis and communities in need. I have worked with to find effective and efficient solutions using a variety of tasks such as brainstorming, collaboration, analysis, research, mediation, and data collection.
