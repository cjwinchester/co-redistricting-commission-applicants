<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I was very excited when I saw the idea of independent redistricting commissions on the ballot, and think this a great idea to ensure that our democracy works as well as possible. An independent, fully representative commission seems to me to be a much more objective and fair way to redraw districts and avoid gerrymandering by any party. As a naturalized American citizen, I believe that I would bring diversity and broad experience to serve Colorado on the commission. I am originally from Uruguay and first came to the U.S. as an exchange student when I was 17. Once my exchange year was over, I went back to Uruguay, where we were living under a dictatorship. I sometimes think I value democracy more because of that experience living under a dictatorship. I came back to pursue my music studies at the university level in 1982 and have lived in the U.S. ever since, becoming a US citizen in the early nineties and moving to Colorado in 1995. I have proudly voted in every single major election since.  
I bring a diverse perspective and voice based on my experience as an immigrant, life-long student and learner, entrepreneur, active community participant and mom. Community engagement is a key part of who I am. My experience on committees and boards for more than 20 years working with very diverse groups of people will be of benefit to the redistricting commission, as I am used to discussing and working on a variety of topics, always seeking to understand and be understood and working to arrive at consensus. 
As I said above, I believe that fair maps are key to every community in Colorado and the entire state. Fair maps will encourage people to vote and to feel that their vote truly counts. Serving on a redistricting commission is important work and the culmination of my life experience and civic engagement. I represent voices that need to be heard as a Hispanic woman entrepreneur who is an American citizen by choice.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My experience both on boards and commissions and as a business owner leading a diverse team has been invaluable in my growth as a leader that seeks consensus and fairness. An example of times where I practiced empathy and where the project required understanding lots of different perspectives is the work I did as a representative of the American Translators Association in creating standards of professional practice in the U.S. and also internationally. During these meetings, there were representatives from academia, government, freelancers and company owners among others. As the ATA representative, my task to represent the interests of the association, which includes freelance translators and interpreters, company and government employees, academia and translation company owners. The members of each of these standards committees also represented each of these different constituencies, and when working on international standards, also represented different countries with different national academic, training and quality standards. As the head of a working group, I had to ensure that everybody’s voice was heard and that everyone participated. There were vast differences of opinion and perspectives, and while many times I disagreed, I put myself in their shoes and tried to understand their background and point of view. Disagreements among committee members were the rule, and by presenting the different sides and ensuring that I and others had heard the different points of view, I worked to get the different sides closer so that in the end we arrived at a consensus standard. Here’s what one of my colleagues on that committee has to say (on my LinkedIn profile page): “Beatriz and I started working together in 2006 when ISO Technical Committee 37 created a new Working Group to develop international standards in translation and interpreting. Right from the beginning Beatriz accepted a leadership role as the project leader for the development of the international specification, ISO/TS 11669: Translation projects - General guidance. Because of her many years of experience as a Spanish translator and interpreter as well as the president and CEO of her own company Syntes Language Group, Inc., she was able to contribute practical expertise and entrepreneurial insight to the document. She guided the many discussions with tact, flexibility and professionalism. Her ability to persuade and to communicate effectively with people in a friendly way brought about the necessary consensus for the standards document to advance through the various stages of development. She demonstrated leadership and commitment, ensuring that the required document was delivered on time at each stage. ISO/TS 11669 was published this month. Beatriz is a people person, committed and caring, not only to her colleagues and customers but also to her community where she also participates actively in a number of charities and educational programs. It was a pleasure to work with Beatriz. She is not only a leading expert and skilled professional in the language industry but also a caring person who strives to meet and exceed expectations. I look forward to working with Beatriz on other projects.”
I also work hard to ensure that I am as impartial and fair as possible when working with my team at Syntes Language Group, itself a diverse team with employees who were born in the U.S., Latin America and Japan, in addition to very different personalities. We work well as a team because as their leader I have created a safe environment for everyone to voice their opinions and bring their challenges and ideas to the team. I listen, seeking to understand, and I try very hard to make sure that everyone is understood, encouraging people to repeat back what they heard and what agreements are made.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I bring a broad skill set to a redistricting commission, with experience gained both from my professional life as an interpreter and translator, and as CEO of my company. As small company, the job of CEO implies wearing a lot of hats, and as such, I have worked on budgeting, strategic planning and optimizing systems and processes. As a translator and interpreter, I have to research and learn new things fast and process and interpret sometimes large amounts of data, as my interpreting and translation assignments over the years have ranged from international investments to oil and gas to marketing and sales to soft skills training to telecommunications and IT to mining technology and court cases. I am a good communicator and enjoy working with diverse groups and building consensus as proven by my work on boards, committees and national and international standards, for example facilitating and helping to bridge the differences between academics and practitioners, which is not always an easy task. I have mediated many differences among my employees as well, so that we can all be a better team together. I am both a global thinker, quickly interpreting data and seeing connections between sometimes seemingly unrelated fields or topics, and detail oriented and analytical. I believe that my education and training as a classical musician has sharpened these skills which have been further honed by my translation and interpreting work.
