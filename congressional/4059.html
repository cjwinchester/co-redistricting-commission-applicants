<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My work on the Logan school board in Denver requires me to understand the unique needs of the diverse school population and objectively weigh that with the fiscal and strategic needs of the school to create a balanced and sustainable approach in our board deliberations and the way I vote on policies (like our Covid-19 back to school plan) and budgetary matters.
My participation in the CPFAN organization required me to learn about the varying issues in the different neighborhoods surrounding City Park in Denver. I had to understand the legal arguments of both the City &amp; County of Denver and the impacts of the I-70/Flood mitigation projects as well as the views of each neighborhood to determine how to connect and communicate my views with Denver City Council and discuss the issues with my neighbors.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The democratic process is incredibly important to me. I don’t believe we should have districting that favors any party. Many people have been disenfranchised and believe their votes do not count. I believe a fair redistricting not only ensures a stable democracy, but encourages everyone to participate in our democratic process, which, over the long term, allows our nation, state and cities to adapt to changing dynamics, demographics, economics and culture in a way that strengthens us as a society. I want to bring my best to the commission to help accomplish a fair, unbiased redistricting within our state.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have spent my career in the corporate world building and managing teams, working cross-functionally and finding common ground. I have also moderated many market roundtables and focus groups that allow people to speak their mind in a safe environment, but ultimately, drive the group to a consensus, whether negotiated (understanding the views of each party) or through direct agreement. I come into this group as an unaffiliated voter. I do not use either party’s platforms to inform my decisions, instead, I read through the state blue book and local voting guides (in the case of the 2020 election, about 150 pages between CO and Denver), as well as my own research and consider each issue and candidate (including school board and judges) individually from both sides first, then as an ecosystem to understand the impacts of my vote on my local and state communities as a whole. I am fair and impartial in that I work to understand the issues and ramifications of both the pro and con sides and determine my opinion based on the spirit of what is trying to be accomplished and how well it accomplishes the stated objective that aligns with the big picture.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am a co-founder of a company and its Chief Operating Officer and separately, I run a business strategy consultancy. In my roles, I am required to understand complex markets and their interdependencies, evaluate opportunities, build go to market strategies, develop internal and external frameworks and operationalize them. I am a natural problem solver and believe that facts should always come first. I analyze data on a daily basis to inform operational planning, understand underlying patterns and what they mean for market risk or opportunity. I recently finished a project with one of my clients (a fortune 500 company) where I was asked to evaluate a business they acquired 4 years ago and make recommendations for what they should do with it. I spent time interviewing stakeholders, mapping the ecosystem, analyzing data and building profit/cost models, etc. Ultimately, I recommended that certain parts of the business be discontinued, built a transition plan for the remaining parts and built a revenue model to replace lost revenue and grow that revenue above break even in 18 months. My recommendations were accepted.
