<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I have participated and lead community advocacy in a few different capacities.  I was first drawn into public education advocacy when I began volunteering at my children’s school.  As I learned more about the state of Colorado’s public services funding mechanisms, I began to see what great inequity exists in our public schools, due in large part to lack of adequate funding. I began to participate with Great Education Colorado, learning as much as I was able about how to repair these inadequacies. I began to talk to anyone who would listen about what was happening, and what the voters of Colorado needed to correct course. I was a vocal community supporter and advocate for Amendment 73.
As a steering committee member of both our local school district’s bond and mill levy override campaigns, I advocated in a more formal manner to encourage members of my community to vote yes on these measures. I also formed an ad hoc committee of community members to organize and advocate for our neighborhood’s interests during the redistricting of boundaries in our school district. My interest and participation in our district’s accountability committee was borne from a passion for representing the interests of my children’s school. Through these experiences, the greatest lesson I have learned it that the best advocacy, whether in a formal or informal capacity, is respectful and informed discourse between people, even those that disagree. In my opinion, it is most profound way to create impactful change.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I’ve volunteered on two local education funding initiative campaigns for Littleton Public School, a bond in 2018 and mill levy override in 2020. I donated to both of these campaigns, as well as the campaign to pass Amendment 73 in 2018.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I wish to serve on this commission because I deeply believe in our American system of representative government.  I hold a political science degree from Colorado State University.  During the course of my studies, I participated in the Legislative Internship Program, and was paired with the late State Senator Claire Traylor.  Senator Traylor was a Jefferson County Republican, and member of the Joint Budget Committee.  It was a great honor to learn from her how local and state policy making work.  This was before politics became so wickedly divisive. I witnessed someone with strong political convictions, which weren’t overly partisan, legislate in a responsible and respectable manner. It was during this time that I built a foundational belief in policy making that is incremental and consensus built. Over the past decade or so, our elected officials have moved away from this manner of legislating. I also believe that common people like me, with enough experience to understand how policy is made, but removed enough to be free of agenda and institutional political influence, are in the best position to advise on issues and policy that drive our representational government. I am so excited that Colorado is leading the way to restore districting back to a representational, not political process.
To this end, my work in advocacy for equitable public education funding has lead me to believe that our state and country has some work to do beyond just education equity. Non-partisan political districting is a foundational way to achieve greater equity in our governmental representation.
I also understand Colorado and Coloradans, living here for all but the first (4) years of my life.  I understand what ‘Colorado Republican’ is. I experience the bluer wave happening in our more urban and suburban areas. And all the unaffiliated and smaller party members. I know old school Denver, when it was a ‘cow town’. I entered my young adulthood as the city of Denver became more cosmopolitan. I interacted with our agricultural and ranching communities while attending Colorado State.  I remember when skiing on the weekends didn’t involve a 4 hour drive, and the direction you put your skies atop your car said something about where you came from. I’ve grown as our microbrew industry has grown, and our outdoor recreation industry became more sophisticated.  Many don’t think of Colorado as being particularly diverse.  I know this isn’t true. And I believe voices from all of those sector of Colorado society and culture deserve representation on this commission.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The ad hoc group of community members I formed is the best way to demonstrate my ability to build consensus.  Due to unusual school locations in the LPS district, our neighborhood was quite a distance from our home school, which created a situation where many people chose to enroll their children in closer-by schools.  This was a detriment to both our neighborhood community and our school community, but easy to understand why parents would make this choice. So with the prospect of a newer, nearby school opening due to the passage of a bond in 2018, I called on a group of 15 parents, mostly moms, to collectively advocate for our neighborhood to attend that school together.  Initial drafts of these boundaries split our neighborhood in two, which we had already experienced the negative impacts of. When considering the formation of this committee, one thing stood out to me; while I would be the person who organized the group, and the relationships I’d built in the district would be helpful, this needed to be a collective, communal effort. I wanted the direction of our advocacy efforts to be informed by what best represented the wishes of our neighborhood.  Parents with young children, maybe not even yet in school needed to be included. Parents who had children who had gone through the schools in a divided neighborhood need to be included.  And with those perspectives, a collective mission and voice was built.  Everyone had the chance to share ideas around what they wished to see and the best way to move forward. Everyone had the chance to contribute their strengths, whether it be letter writing, new map formation, local property value expertise, or representing the potential negative impact on other school communities. Our efforts were successful, and I’m certain it was because we created a campaign built on team consensus and respectful communication.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am not a mathematician or a statistician, but I do believe in data driven decision making. In my view, data is the most impartial place to begin a conversation around how to build new districts.  My strength however, is the ability to understand different perspectives in a fundamental way, while withholding judgement if those perspectives are different than mine.  I am also a natural mediator, process oriented manager and big picture thinker. Perhaps most of all, I understand people.  Most of us on some level are motivated by a basic desire to be heard and understood. When members of a group experience this level of understanding, they tend to be able to work together better and more productively, because a basic level of trust and cooperation exists. I think this would be one of my greatest contributions to the commission.
