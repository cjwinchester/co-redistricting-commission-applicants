        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Jacqueline A List</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Jacqueline A List
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Jackie List</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Executive Director, Safe Shelter of St. Vrain Valley
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Formal Education: Master of Arts in Education, University of Cincinnati; Bachelor of Fine Arts, Miami University
Additional training and research over 30+ years covered a wide variety of topics primarily related to administration of organizational operations and social justice. Topics include, but are not limited to:
Administrative duties: fiscal management, policy development and implementation, agency operations oversight, program development, liaison to the community, collaborative relationships with community agencies. Social Justice Advocacy/Activism in areas of intimate partner abuse, child abuse &amp; neglect, elder rights, offender management, homelessness, housing, etc.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80501
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
The only political activity in which I participate involves advocating with legislators for social issues that impact the people we serve as a domestic violence victim service organization. I do not personally participate with any campaigns or political organizations.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Community organizations with whom I&#39;m currently active include: Boulder County Domestic Violence/Child Protection Work Group; St. Vrain Community; Longmont Housing Opportunities Team; Elder Justice Coalition;
Boulder County Homeless Management Board; Domestic Violence Program Advisory Committee. I have been appointed to serve on the Colorado Domestic Violence Offender Management Board and the Boulder County Integrated Managed Partnership for Adolescent and Child Community Treatment (IMPACT) Partnership

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
For 30+ years I have organized, represented, and advocated for victims of domestic abuse, intimidation and exploitation. That advocacy has included advocating for the rights of marginalized and oppressed communities. The list of community and professional organizations listed above indicate many of the groups for whom I&#39;ve advocated.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
In the work that I do, it is imperative that voices of every community are considered in the decision making of our legislators. Equity among those being represented can only be assured if the districts in which they live are are fairly represented through responsible division of districts in the state.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Much social justice work requires active listening, weighing information without assumption or bias, and serving as a community liaison who is able to productively compromise with those whose perspectives may differ from mine. I will employ the skills necessary to support equitable solutions in decision making on the Commission. I believe that the ability to be fair and impartial is a skill I&#39;ve fine-tuned over the years. Equity can only be attained if all voices are heard and respected.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In the role of Executive Director--a role I&#39;ve held for 11 years--the ability to think analytically and apply logic and reason is vital to success. The current pandemic has most recently tested my skills in a situation not experienced before. Health Department information was received, analyzed, applied to our particular staff/client/agency needs, and carefully adopted to assure minimal risk to employees and clients. The Emergency Shelter is an essential business, which had to remain in operation to keep victims safe. We adhered to all precautions, reduced the number of staff onsite at any one time, asked residents to limit interactions outside the shelter, reassessed each resident as they returned to shelter, asked residents to minimize interaction with one another, limited number of residents admitted, established quarantine rooms, and carefully oversaw the use of handwashing, social distancing, and mask wearing while residents were in common areas. Our public office, on the other hand, provides services that can be done remotely, so advocates and administrators at that site were ask to work from home. We had lifted some of the restrictions in the public office, as recommendations suggested. With the rise of COVID-19 numbers, we&#39;ve reduced staff in the public office to 25% and will close it completely if any staff test positive. During this time, analysis, logic, and reason prevail in maintaining safety.
