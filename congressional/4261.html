        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Melora K Bentz</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Melora K Bentz
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Melora Owen Bentz</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a self-employed mediator. My business is Middle Path Mediation, LLC. Over the past ten years, other positions that I have held include Researcher/Writer for the Alternate Defense Counsel (indigent criminal defense), self-employed Lawyer at The Bentz Law Office, LLC (EEO investigative researcher and writer, dissolved 2012); Yoga Instructor and Meditation Guide at YogaMelora, LLC and with CorePower Yoga, LLC.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I received my B.A. from Oberlin College in 1994. I received my J.D. from the Case Western Reserve University School of Law in 1998. I have been a criminal and civil litigator in my legal career and taught Criminal Procedure and Evidence at Metropolitan State University of Denver. I received my 200-Hr Yoga Teaching Certificate in 2010 and taught yoga for the past ten years. In 2019 I received my Certificate of Completion for 40-hours of training in the theory and practice of Mediation from the Colorado Bar Association.  Most recently, I received a Certificate of Completion from the Colorado Democratic Party Watchers (volunteer) in order to be eligible to be a poll watcher (I ended up not being needed).
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80206
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated to the Democratic National Party and some Democratic politicians who were running for office. For example, I recall donating money to Cory Booker&#39;s campaign, Bernie Sanders&#39;, Joe Biden&#39;s campaign, and Jaime Harrison&#39;s (GA) campaign. Organizations that I contribute to include the ACLU, SPLC, Dress for Success, Colorado Humanities, Holt International Orphanage, and Doctors Without Borders.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
The ACLU, Dress for Success, Colorado Humanities Board of Directors (elected, not appointed); the Democratic National Party, the Blue Bench (donations), 9 to 5 (eviction defense volunteer), Denver Dumb Friends League, and the Oberlin College Alumni Association. I have also volunteered with the Denver Elections Division in (I believe) three different elections, including 2012 and 2008.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I am a natural attorney in that I have always enjoyed the opportunity to zealously advocate on behalf of my client. But, as I&#39;ve gotten experience in the legal field and in life, I started to gravitate more toward the position of the Mediator, or the neutral person in the room who is less concerned with being right and more concerned with helping parties to find neutral ground. From there, there is an opportunity to create change, to serve more than one side&#39;s interests, and to really help people. I have been an organizer on behalf of my alma mater, Oberlin College (OH), here in Colorado. I served as Class President for the past 25 years, responsible for coordinating a team of volunteers and organizing each reunion and reunion event on behalf of my Class. This included fundraising on an annual basis and personally reaching out to classmates via letters and emails. I have enjoyed advocating for women who are struggling to return to the workplace by volunteering for Dress For Success. I have conducted practice job interviews and counseled women on how to feel prepared and confident as they apply for jobs, which was very rewarding. As a yoga instructor, I publicly speak to Coloradans on matters of humanity: connection, compassion, understanding, health of our communities and what draws us altogether as humankind. As a mediator, I routinely deal with parties that come to me from polar extremes. As a mediator, I take into consideration the priorities and concerns of each party and facilitate a productive conversation in hopes of leading the parties to resolution.  In many of these situations, meaningful communication and earnest effort makes all the difference in bridging gaps.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am interested in serving on the commission because I believe that this is a very important issue that the United States must face. Now, more than ever, we are aware of how important it is to have congressional districts created such that constituents are fairly represented in Washington, D.C. The opportunity to create fair, equitable districting for Congressional purposes is a valuable one and will benefit every citizen of Colorado. As a volunteer for Colorado Humanities, I had the opportunity to attend &quot;Humanities on the Hill&quot; in March 2020 - an opportunity for all of the Humanities Councils from the U.S. to meet with their legislators and inform them of the programs we offer and the way in which their constituents are benefitting from them. It really opened my eyes to the importance of legislative districting and the goal of affording everyone a voice when it comes to fair representation.  As a member of the Board of Directors at Colorado Humanities, we are cognizant of the different populations being served within Colorado&#39;s legislative districts. We take into consideration the racial, socioeconomic, health and agricultural differences at Colorado Humanities as we design and implement programming for those communities. I had the opportunity to meet face to face with Diane DeGette, and with representatives/aides for Congressman Ed Perlmutter, Congressman Joe Neguse, Congressman Ken Buck, Congressman Doug Lamborn, Congressman Cory Gardner, Congressman Michael Bennett, Congressman Jason Crow, and Congressman Scott Tipton. It was a rewarding experience to be able to go to our legislators and let them know what Colorado Humanities is doing for their constituents. I went as a volunteer and was not paid. To really meet with legislators and their aides was incredibly educational. Looking at the Colorado districts on a map was one thing, but to then go into the offices of their representatives and learn about how different each district&#39;s makeup is, how their needs differ, what they pride themselves on, etc. was a great way to learn about our great state of Colorado. We must ensure that any legislative/congressional redistricting changes that occur do so via concerted effort to provide fair representation in Congress for all of the residents of Colorado. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I named my business Middle Path Mediation, LLC and my goal is to &quot;Lead parties down a path, to a workable middle ground, toward resolution.&quot;  While I have a fiery, competitive side to me that is well-suited for litigation and fighting for justice and liberty, I also have a very calm, diplomatic side to me that has always been at work as a peacekeeper (I am the youngest of five children). I believe that my skills as a litigator, lawyer, humanitarian, yogi, volunteer, wellness coach, and advocate for fairness and equality will serve the Commission well. I relish the opportunity to be fair and impartial and will do what I can to contribute to the creation of fair and equitable redistricting of the legislative districts as set out by the Commission. As a mediator, my skills include bringing people together who do not necessarily want to compromise in any way. While I have a fiery, competitive side to me that is well-suited for litigation and fighting for justice and liberty, I also have a very calm, diplomatic side to me that has always been at work as a peacekeeper. I am the youngest of five children, and my mission, even as a child, was always to keep the peace between everyone. I strive to help people as an advocate for meaningful conversation, truthful negotiation, and intelligent compromise.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a lawyer I have been trained over the past 20 years to employ analytical skills and apply logic and reason to a problem. As a trial attorney, my motto served me well: &quot;kill them with kindness and be the most prepared attorney in the room.&quot; As a lawyer, I step up to the challenge of legal analysis, research and writing, and public debate. I am not intimidated by any of it. As I said before, I have moved a bit more toward middle ground, and do not insist that I must win every single argument. In my personal life, I have allowed compassion and kindness to enter the equation. Ultimately, I have upmost respect for the law, the Bench, my Oath for Admission to the Colorado Bar, and my civic duties. It would be an honor to represent the residents of Colorado on this Commission.
