        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Phillip Salvador</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Phillip Salvador
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Occupational Therapist, Denver Public Schools
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a Master&#39;s degree in Educational Leadership from the University of Denver and a Bachelor&#39;s degree in Occupational Therapy from Eastern Washington University. I have obtained my principal and occupational therapist licensure from the state of Colorado. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80205
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not been very involved politically outside of voting. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
n/a
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have spent my career in the public school system, working with and advocating for children with special needs and their families. I&#39;ve worked with many people of diverse backgrounds, collaborating on teams of educators, parents, students, and families to find solutions for tough problems. In the 2018-19 school year, I was the head of Godsman Elementary&#39;s Collaborative School Committee (similar to a PTA). The committee facilitated parental concerns and advocated for our students&#39; well-being and educational needs. We brought in multiple stake-holders, including our City Council Representative Jolon Clark, to find creative solutions for funding our after school programs. The nature of the work of an educator is to be an advocate for students and their families. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I would like to serve on the commission because I believe that it&#39;s vital work to make sure every voice is heard. In 2018, I voted for amendments Y and Z because I believe gerrymandering is a fundamental threat to our democracy. The bipartisan commission ensures that every voice is heard and I would be thrilled to be a part of it. As a person of color and son of an immigrant, I would bring a unique perspective and diversity of experience to the commission. In 2017, I attended the University of Denver and studied equity in leadership in the public school setting. That experience, along with serving as the Dean of Culture for Godsman elementary in Denver, taught me the value of multicultural leadership and equipped me to serve as a culturally competent leader and activist. I&#39;ve spent a lot of time reflecting on my identity and biases, and understanding how to work with people who look different than me - culturally, racially, and politically. I would love to employ that training in service of the commission and Colorado.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Working as an educator, I&#39;m experienced at collaborating in teams to find an equitable solution in often contentious meetings. I&#39;m practiced at facilitating meetings and working in small groups. I know that tempers can run high when people are invested, and that meeting people with respect and empathy can go a long way toward finding a solution that works for everyone. I would be a fair and impartial committee member because I believe every person has the right to be represented. I don&#39;t want to gain an advantage for &quot;my team&quot; - I want all voices to be heard. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In my role as Dean of Culture at Godsman Elementary, I was responsible for tracking all of the data about student progress and test scores, compiling and analyzing it, and meeting with teachers and administrators to strategize about how to improve student education. I led a team of teachers to analyze the data and provide targeted interventions for underperforming students. As a result of our data collection and strategic interventions, students improved in multiple metrics across grade levels. Similarly, as a therapist, I have to track student progress and tailor my approach to their needs. I&#39;m experienced in analyzing a situation and finding a reasonable solution.
