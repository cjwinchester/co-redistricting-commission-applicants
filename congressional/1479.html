</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80501
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have voted in every election since 1972. While my choices leaned toward the Democratic side, I have voted for Republican candidates if I thought they would do ab better job. I have been a member of the Longmont Area Democrats since 2016 and I have served as a Boulder County Precinct Leader (651) since that same year. I have mainly been involved in the Boulder County Democratic Party&#39;s GET OUT THE VOTE campaign  in each of the last three elections. I have been able to recruit 5 neighbors to help me with this endeavor and this past election, I walked the streets alone because I did not want to expose my volunteers to possible COVID complications. I have been sending $10 a month to the BCDP since President Trump&#39;s election in 2016.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I volunteered as a youth baseball coach for 6 years (!992-98).  I served on the Board of Directors for the St. Vrain Youth Soccer Association from 1996-2000. I was a proud member of the SVVEA (teacher union) and served as the school representative from 2000-2006. I was a member of the Colorado High School Coaches Association as well as of the Colorado Athletic Directors Association. I served on the City of Longmont&#39;s Golf Advisory Board from 2015 to 2018. I am a member of the Longmont Chorale (I like to sing). I worked with neighborhood groups to help with the flood recovery in 2013.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
In my work as a teacher, athletic director, and coach, I always strived to make decisions and create atmospheres where students would find personal and team success. In these situations, the concerns of the students came first and all other considerations fell in place behind them.
I was considered tough but fair with FAIR being the constant.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I decided after retiring from teaching that I needed to put my money where my mouth is and commit to being the active citizen that I had encouraged my students to become. I feel I have had a positive influence on my neighborhood through my precinct leader duties. I am against gerrrymandering and don&#39;t believe districts should be designed to be &#39;safe&#39; for either political party. I realize that Colorado has a unique population density predicament but I resented (for the first time) the redistricting in Colorado that occurred after the 2010  census. Both parties were &#39;guilty&#39; of creating districts that would be safe for them (the 4th for Republicans and the 6th for Democrats). I would hope when geographically feasible, all of our districts would have fair competition for the seat at stake.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I know that people, when presented with an identical packet of facts, may interpret them in a widely diverse way. The more fair and impartial you are, the easier the path to consensus is. I have tried in my career to put the interests of the whole above those of the individual  - and that takes compromise and the ability to listen.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I was always a good student and a decent writer. I have written over 10 op-ed pieces for the local newspaper on subjects ranging from supporting public schools to a variety of political issues and they have been well received. My ability to maintain a class that students looked forward to attending as well as my administrative experiences have taught me to see both sides of an issue. It has also taught me that when I feel strongly about a subject, I need to persuade and mentor run roughshod with my ideas  --  it has taught me to listen before acting.
