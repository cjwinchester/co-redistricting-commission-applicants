        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Michaele L Ferguson</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Michaele L Ferguson
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Michaele Lynne Ferguson</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Colorado Boulder
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I graduated from Smoky Hill High School here in Colorado in 1990, I have an A.B. in Philosophy and Comparative Literature from Bryn Mawr College, and a PhD in Political Science from Harvard University.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80304
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I donated $100 this fall to the Biden/Harris campaign. I don&#39;t recall any other donations to political campaigns since 2015. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Member, Association for Political Theory, 2004-
Member, Western Political Science Association, 1999-
Lifetime Member, American Political Science Association, 1998-
Member, Reacting Consortium, 2013-

While I do not belong to these organizations, I have given talks at retirement communities, to a local Rotary Club, and to the League of Women Voters. I am effective at outreach to the public because my many years of teaching have taught me how to break down complicated concepts for a politically diverse audience.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My experience has been with advocating for my undergraduate and graduate students within my department and within the University of Colorado Boulder. I also have significant leadership experience on departmental, college, and campus-wide committees working with students, staff, and faculty to build consensus on how to address problems together. I am trained in inclusive leadership techniques, and I am recognized for my ability to bring different groups together to achieve common goals.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am deeply concerned about how partisan-led redistricting has contributed to the increasing polarization in our nation, and to the corresponding loss of faith in our democracy. I would be honored if I were selected to be a part of the solution. As an expert in democratic theory, I believe I have a unique perspective to bring to the commission, as someone who can navigate the scholarly research on redistricting, the political history of our redistricting process, and the classic ideas that motivated our Founding Fathers to design the system we have today.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My job as a professor of political theory involves teaching contentious subjects to a political diverse and divided student body. In my large lecture classes, I teach about liberalism and conservatism, about white nationalism and antiracism. It is my job to present that material fairly, and to do so in a way that all of my students can gain insight into why adherents to each ideology find those views attractive. I am experienced at trying to understand where my students are coming from, so that I can better reach and teach them. And I am trained to evaluate their work impartially. My background gives me insight into the diversity of political views here in Colorado, which could help me to assist ideological opponents to understand where each other is coming from. This is what I do every day as a professor of politics, and it is what I do as a facilitator on the many committees on which I serve in the university and beyond.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am trained to think critically about complex political problems. I regularly analyze political rhetoric, policies, legal decisions, and other texts as a part of my research and teaching. As a book author, I am experienced with the planning and commitment involved in long-term projects.
