<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Throughout my career and volunteer service, I have dedicated myself to bringing together individuals and organizations with differing perspectives to achieve the common goal of advancing public education, the backbone of our democracy and economy. Empowering communities across Colorado has always been at the heart of this work and has involved a sustained commitment to elevating diverse voices, increasing knowledge, solving complex problems, and making connections. 

My professional expertise is in the communications arena as well as in coalition-building. I helped lead and develop the Colorado Education Network and the Great Schools, Thriving Communities education coalition. My experience leading a diverse coalition — representing the traditional education community, advocacy, and civil right groups — balancing the perspectives of these various stakeholders and helping each organization understand and empathize with others was some of the most rewarding work I have ever done. Balancing Front Range with rural school district needs provided me with great perspective of what our citizens across Colorado are experiencing.

For the past two decades, I have advocated for and advanced equity and excellence in local government. As a product of public schools and a first-generation college graduate, I am keenly aware of the role that government can and must play in providing opportunity to all. I am unyielding in my commitment to protect and advance that role. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My diverse background experiences have prepared me with the skills, experience, and passion required to serve as a redistricting commissioner. I have provided hundreds of presentations across Colorado over the past decade in an effort to help explain education and fiscal policy. I enjoy this type of work and have grown from listening as much as presenting to Coloradans.

Our democracy relies on citizens fulfilling their civic duty. While some focus on the the panels&#39; power to shape Colorado’s political landscape for a decade, I think the work of the redistricting commission is vitally important in that it bolsters Coloradans&#39; belief that our democracy is fair and that their voices are heard.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I consider myself to be politically astute, without being partisan. Having run for a school board seat twice in Douglas County as an unaffiliated candidate, I have learned a great deal about the importance of promoting consensus and community. Now as a sitting school board member, it is my responsibility to govern for all Douglas County residents. Helping our community understand challenges and issues is critically important. By remaining nonpartisan in my work, I have created a track record that allows me to more easily work with all policymakers in a nonpartisan way that allows the mission to stay front-and-center in today’s hyper-partisan environment.

I am confident I have the desired competencies to be successful as a commissioner. In addition, I deeply value and rely upon my solid network of established relationships and encourage you to contact the professional references provided. Being fair or impartial in my decision-making has been a foundational principle for me in advancing public education, our economy, and democracy throughout my career. My track record with honoring and empowering others would be an asset in this role. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Serving on a school board during the current global pandemic where communities are divided about the right approach to serving students requires a logical and analytical approach to decision-making. It also requires communication skills to help explain the rationale behind those decisions.

I find that having goals, values, and intentions clearly articulated at the onset of the project are foundational to success. In addition, being self-aware and honest are essential in order to tackle the problem and in order to read other people’s emotions. Often teams do not create or take the time to create constraints (whether it is time, resources, or options), which cause friction and inefficiencies in the process. I am a trained mediator, which requires a logical, non-emotional, and non-judgmental approach to addressing issues. This is how I approach problems.

Finally, I have a track record of using visual tools, such as infographics, to help explain complex topics. I have also created budget simulation tools to help explain and communicate the realities of various choices under consideration. The development of interactive digital communication tools requires logic and reason.
