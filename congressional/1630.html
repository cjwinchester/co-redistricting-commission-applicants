        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Craig A Carlson</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Craig A Carlson
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Self employed 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Primary- Mapleton Dist 1
Secondary - attended 1970-73 BYU Political Science 1974 CU Business (no degrees)
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80022
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been very active politically since turning voting age. After registering to vote I attended my 1st precinct caucus and became precinct committeeman. Since that time I have been involved in numerous elections supporting both dems and republicans, in my voting and contributions. My involvment starts at the very small and local campaigns and issues and rises to Presidential elections. In the last election cycle I supported three candidates for President, Bennett, Hickenlooper and Biden. In the 2016 election for President I supported two candidates, Romney and Clinton. In the last Senate race in Colorado I supported both Romanoff then Bennett. At the more local level I have alway been supported Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated candidates which I believed could best lead the community, effort or cause which I believed was most beneficial to the community. That included City, County, School Districts, bond issues and local improvements. I am thankful that I was able to support these efforts financially, but regret the burden I feel being on so many fund raising lists and requests for my volunteer time.

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
The remaining organizations that I am still involved with or have been active in are the following: Metro North Chamber, Boulevard One Community Association, Unison Housing Partners, DRCOG Sustainable Communities and many more.

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Two organization that I have been extremely active with over the year come to mind as being the most meaningful. First the Adams County Chamber of Commerce, which became the Metro North Chamber. That organization grew from just representing Adams County business interests, to covering portions of several other Counties, and more than seven cities or portions thereof. That area contained very diverse business centers and a wide variety of trade and commerce. All of those areas had separate governmental elected leadership and constituencies.
The other organization which I was honored to serve in leadership was the Colorado Home Builders Association, which represented the individual Home Builders throughout the State. I was called upon to serve this entity and the Colorado Trustee to the National Associations political action committee (PAC). I was mostly the token Democrat, in a conservative mostly Republican organization and held that capacity for six years.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have a knowledge of most of the geographic and political interest groups throughout the State. I am a private pilot and have enjoyed visiting most parts of this beautiful State, getting to know and understand the diverse variety of great people who are citizens. The current process used in  configuring Congressional Districts has not been the best. In some cases districts boundaries nearly extend from border to border, while its citizens have very different needs and desires. Maybe we can find a better process to represent all in a more logical way?
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that I have been able to demonstrate this ability in the wide variety of entities that was honored to serve. I was rewarded by serving in many cases for lengthy terms because of the consensus and harmony that was built.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
The answer to this area should come from others that I have worked with.  From my perspective what ever talent I may have has worked for me during my business career and for the communities I have aimed to improve.
