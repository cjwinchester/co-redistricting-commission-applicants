        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Danielle Piscatelli</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Danielle Piscatelli
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Outdoor Educator and Outdoor Guide - currently employed by Colorado Mountain College, Fitpacking, Colorado Mountain Expeditions and Pike&#39;s Peak Alpine School
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Highest educational degree - Masters of Public Administration in Non-Profit Management. Certifications include: Wilderness First Responder (including BLS/CPR/AED) and AIARE Level 1
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80209
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not donated money to politics in any capacity.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Volunteer - Women&#39;s Wilderness, Chair Board of Directors; Volunteers for Outdoor Colorado, Crew Leader; Camber Outdoors, Regional Volunteer Manager - CO region; Colorado Fourteeners Initiative, Peak Steward
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have been a volunteer for as long as I can remember.  When I moved to Colorado almost five years ago, one of my first actions was involving myself in at least one organization. About a month after arriving I joined the Board of Directors of Women’s Wilderness.  I have held the leadership position of Chair for the past four years.  Since then, the number of other organizations I have become involved with has grown.  Through my time as Chair I have successfully managed an Executive Director transition, built the board from a floundering four At-Large members to thirteen, stabilized the financials and governed through the beginnings of the pandemic. I never become engaged in something if I do not believe in its mission. Heading a Board of Directors has allowed me to collaborate with a diverse group of individuals; and given me the opportunity to work through issues in a respectful and constructive manner.  I believe this will be a benefit serving on the commission.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
This type of work fascinates me.  It is unlike anything I do in my professional life, working within the outdoor industry.  However, I find it appealing.  I follow politics, speak out on issues that have value to me, but I do not participate in major politics.  Although I have public administration degrees in both my bachelor’s and master’s, I have never really done this type of work, but I am interested in being a part of this process.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am still relatively new to Colorado, having only moved here in 2016.  There is a lot I do not know about the State.  I believe this level of ignorance is a benefit.  I have no ownership of how the districts are divided presently.  I was not living here ten years ago when the census was done, therefore I don’t have the reference points from how the redistricting might have changed at that time.  I feel I am approaching the commission with a clean slate, with no hidden agenda or otherwise bias.  As a result, I believe I will be fair and impartial.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In my job as a guide it is essential, I assess situations with a clear viewpoint.  I need to be able to forecast any potential risks before they might happen.  I must anticipate issues with clients before the issue arises.  This type of critical thinking allows me to focus and think clearly when a problem does happen.  I can see what is happening from an outsider’s point of view which allows me to resolve it.  Certainly, this type of critical thinking, one based in emergency situations, is different but transferrable.
