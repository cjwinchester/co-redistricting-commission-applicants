        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Fernando Lugo</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Fernando Lugo
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Fernando Lugo</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  As of right now, my only employer is Matheson Flight extenders, I am hoping to be employed by a Recruiting Firm. I will have an answer by them before the end of the week
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Currently pursuing Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Government with an emphasis in Legal Studies from Grand Canyon University, also graduated in 2006 from Heritage College School of Pharmacy with a Pharmacy Technology Diploma
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80012
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated to the Bernie Sanders campaign in the fall of 2019
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I cannot claim any affiliations as I do not currently belong to any organization as I do not pay any dues- however I stand in solidarity and alliance with organizations that have been crucial in securing equal justice under the law. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have considered such organizations such as the Aurora Chamber of Commerce, Denver Communists, and the Party For Socialism and Liberation, as well as the Green Party though I have not become an official member of either of these groups, most of this has been due to the fact that I have other personal financial obligations that prevent me from being fluid with financial membership to any of these organizations. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the commission for many reasons. Primarily, I believe it would be my civic duty to serve on an important commission that will not only affect me, but also my neighbors, co workers, friends, family, immigrants, asylees and refugees that would also be impacted by the decisions of the Redistricting Commission. In addition, I am proud to say that I once served as student government president when I was in community college. Serving not only would be an honor and privilege, but it would also be the right thing for me to do. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Regardless of my own political views, which I am aware that there may be some concerns by the judges who will ultimately make the decision to grant me a seat- I will seek a consensus that will be as fair and just, impartial yet equitable to all who will be impacted by the decisions made. As a commissioner, I will seek consensus by listening to others on the panel, but keeping in mind the significant impact what that consensus could bring to our communities. While I recognize that it may be nearly impossible to have all sides agree to everything, I acknowledge that it will be incumbent upon me to work as a team to ensure the most favorable result that will benefit everyone in the most equitable fashion. In my past experience as Student Government President, I utilized the guidance of elders, negotiated with other club members who sought funds from student government funds for various projects and approved different measured based on necessity and practicality. I feel that this experience will be an asset to the Commission in adhering to the rules of fairness and impartiality. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
The process of elimination has served me well when it comes to the application of logic and reasoning. However, that will not be the only tool that I will use as I am tasked with resolving a problem.  As a Commissioner, I will employ a healthy combination of research, factual data and tangible evidence to demonstrate why and how I have arrived to a conclusion in an effort to gain a consensus among other panelists who express varying concerns regarding any particular topic.
