<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My past political activity has largely been passive. I am an active voter, I have participated in every caucus available to me, and I stay regularly informed about the political events in my county of Denver and the larger political conversation in the state. I have infrequently participated in phone banks, but have made calls for causes that have been particularly meaningful to me. I have not donated money since 2015 to political organizations. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
All organizations which count me as a member have been in the field of education, and these are organizations have primarily national, as opposed to local, organizations (America Achieves, National Academy of Advanced Teacher Education). 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
In many respects, my job as Dean of Students is to be a liaison between the school and the community writ large. I regularly work with parents, community members, students, and teachers. I work to ensure that we have a cohesive vision, are able to overcome conflicts to reach a mutually agreed upon goal, and then work to achieve that goal. 

As a result of this position, it is my job to speak on behalf of, represent, and consider the interests of every different facet of the school building - ensuring that everyone&#39;s needs are met, and ensuring that the ultimate goal has been achieved; a high quality education for all. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Fairness and support for our communities. 
I am deeply excited about the idea of this independent commission for redistricting with equal shares of democrats, republicans and independents. Ultimately, district lines have historically been drawn to manage votes for one side or the other. I propose a new objective for district boundaries. 

Districts should be drawn logically - where do communities authentically begin and end? 
Districts should be drawn with representation in mind - are all voices heard? Are all demographics accounted for?
Districts should be drawn in a way that reflects the census - where are more people, what are their perspectives? 
Districts should be drawn in a way that supports the political voice of the people. 

I am excited about this process and this commission because this is the work that will set up the state for success (or failure) for the next 10 years. It&#39;s critical that we get it right. It is important that we consider the lines with thought, care, respect, and intentionality. To do otherwise is to fail the state, the will of the people, and the desire for a thoughtful democracy. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my workplace, consensus is the only way to navigate toward an agreed upon goal. The key from my perspective is to work within some really specific guardrails:
1. Is everyone working toward the same goal
2. Is everyone looking at the same information
3. Is everyone assuming best intent from the others in the conversation

If we are able to achieve those accomplishments before we begin the conversation of actual redistricting, I think we&#39;ll find great success in working together, finding consensus, and identifying the correct end goals. Whenever we stray from those agreed upon ideas, we&#39;ll always be able to point to our north star to identify where to course-correct. 

When it comes to impartiality, I don&#39;t think anyone could say they are 100% impartial. That, seemingly, shouldn&#39;t be the goal either. The purpose instead should be to speak honestly, argue productively, listen earnestly, and then find places of agreement and consensus while identifying best paths forward. That is the root of fairness. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I believe that analytics and logic require two foundational elements in order to be successful. 

The first is data - it&#39;s important to have as much information as possible before making relevant decisions. In this case, population information survey data, census data, among a litany of other valuable data points. Without accurate and correct data, it is far more challenging (albeit not impossible) to make the right decision. I love reviewing data, analyzing spreadsheets, and identifying the diamonds inside the rough. 

The second component is in identifying the right questions. Oftentimes we get distracted by trying to find answers to the question, but the truth is that we far more often need to find all of the questions before we can begin answering them. Being able to identify the &quot;whys&quot; and the &quot;hows&quot; are just as critical to identifying where certain lines should be drawn. Spending far more time on this part of the conversation will be critical toward a successful redistricting process.
