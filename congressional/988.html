        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Constance Jean Hass</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Constance Jean Hass
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Constance Hass</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I currently am a retired teacher, but am working on our cattle operation, not as a paid employee.
I was employed by Hoehne School District, R-3, for the last 33 years as a math educator.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  BS in Mathematics and then garnered a teaching license for 7-12 Mathematics from USC (now CSU Pueblo).
MT, Masters in Teaching from Grand Canyon University
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81082
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Organization is something done daily by an educator.  I was in the classroom for 33 years and I was constantly organizing students whether in the classroom or with a Student Council project.  As a member of the Colorado Farm Bureau Women’s Leadership Committee, I help organize fund raising events for Ag Education and for Ronald McDonald Houses of Colorado.  Through the Colorado Farm Bureau, I advocate for Agriculture and rural Colorado so that we may continue to feed this nation and stay relevant among the large populations in our state.  I have represented Colorado Agriculture in Washington D.C. as well as testified before our legislature in Denver.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been involved with my local Republican Party as a member and precinct chair.  I have also helped with my husband&#39;s campaign for County Commissioner.  I have donated to the Las Animas County Republican Party and Cory Gardner&#39;s Campaign.

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Hoehne Teacher’s Organization,  Angels in Aprons (church group cooking for the sick or dying), NCTM (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics),   Colorado Farm Bureau Women’s Leadership Committee, Colorado Farm Bureau Federation Board of Directors, Southern Farm Bureau Insurance Board of Directors, Las Animas County Republican Party, Leadership Program of the Rockies.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on this commission to guarantee Agriculture and rural Colorado continues to have a voice among our legislators.  Too often, rural Colorado has been told that their vote does not count, and this commission is the way to make sure those voices do matter.  I believe my participation with the many organizations as well as being an educator have helped me to become a person who can bring people together.  I listen to all sides, options, and opinions before making my own.  I also must be fair and impartial when grading student papers.  One must take the information before us and make an opinion based on what we see, have heard, and know in an impartial and fair way.  I am one of those people.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As an educational and Agricultural leader, I have to bring people together, to inspire and ignite interest and compassion for my cause.  I have done that many times during Policy Discussion at the Farm Bureau Annual meetings as well as in my classroom getting students who don&#39;t really want to be there to participate in class.  It can be really difficult to inspire students to learn and complete the work in the classroom, but with patience, understanding and listening skills, it can be done.  As an educator, I have to be fair and impartial as I have my student&#39;s futures in my hands.  I always do my very best to give the most fair and impartial judgement of their work possible
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
A degree in Mathematics requires logic and reasoning along with analytical skills.  I feel I have an exceptional grasp on these skills, but, not only as they relate to mathematics, but in the real world as well.  Helping my husband to run our cattle operation also requires all these skills daily.  We constantly have to monitor the grazing situation, water availability and the amount of cattle on the land.  It is a constant review of what is going on around us on the ranch.
