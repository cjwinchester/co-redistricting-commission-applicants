        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Sarah Erickson</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Sarah Erickson
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Sarah Elizabeth Erickson, Sarah Piersky, Sarah Elizabeth Piersky</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Occupational Health Registered Nurse-Children&#39;s Hospital Colorado
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have my bachelors degree in nursing and am currently a licensed registered nurse working at Children&#39;s Hospital Colorado. I have previously worked in the ICU at the Denver VA Medical Center, as a hospice case manager, and in a sexual health clinic. I am currently enrolled in my masters degree in nursing with a focus in healthcare policy through Chamberlain University. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80516
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
As a nurse whose career has spanned age, race, economic, religious and sexual identity demographics, I have become passionate about using my voice to advocate for those whose voices are often overlooked. Since 2015, I have volunteered with Hope House Colorado, a nonprofit organization that provides educational and financial assistance to teenage mothers that come from generational poverty. In the past five years, I have created several educational opportunities to allow the teens to learn more about their bodies and safe sexual practices, while also occasionally being a professional mentor to young women who have expressed interest in pursuing careers in the healthcare field. I am additionally involved with Cobalt, which raises awareness and supports policies at a state and federal level that protect women&#39;s access to reproductive healthcare. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have only recently become involved with politics and civic engagement. I have not volunteered for any political campaigns or organizations yet, but have donated money. These are some of the political organizations/campaigns I have donated money to: Human Rights Campaign, Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, Blue Revolution 2020, Cobalt, John Hickenlooper for Senate, Joe Biden for President, ActBlue. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I volunteer with Hope House Colorado as the volunteer nurse educator. I have also previously been involved with National Nurses United, a nursing union that I was a member of when I worked at the Denver VA Medical Center. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Over the past two years, I have been re-evaluating my professional career and thinking about how I want to best utilize my skills as a nurse. I have become very interested in the political process and the intersection of how healthcare and policy can ensure more people have access to high quality healthcare. I am currently working on my masters in nursing with a focus on healthcare policy and want to work at a state or federal level to advise, research and craft policy that makes our healthcare system more efficient, effective, accessible, affordable and equitable. Serving on the commission would be a perfect introduction into learning how individuals and communities engage with government and the civic process, and would allow me to use my voice to advocate for those who are unable to advocate for themselves. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a nurse, it is my responsibility to take medically complex information given by providers to give patients and their families the necessary information to make the best decisions for their care. Additionally, I take the expressed wishes of patient and their families about their goals of care and advocate for their needs to their medical team. A significant component of my job is creating consensus among many groups of people with often very differing views. As nursing is the intersection of science and caring, I am able to use both appeals to emotion and appeals to reason to bring people together towards a common goal. Nursing requires fairness and impartiality, as my job is to care for my patients and advocate for their expressed goals rather than applying my thoughts, feelings or opinions to their care. I will use all of the skills and knowledge I have generated as a nurse to promote consensus, agreement, fairness and impartiality on the commission. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Many times throughout my career, I have had to draw on logic and reason to solve a problem. Frequently in my time as an ICU nurse, I would need to utilize critical thinking and applied logic to determine why my patient was declining quickly, which involved referencing their medical chart, looking over previous lab values and anticipating what the provider might order to help resolve the patient&#39;s problems. In my current role managing calls from employees regarding COVID, I must use algorithms and policies to determine who needs to be tested for COVID and who is safe to return to work without potentially infecting other employees. I utilize logic and reason every day in my job as a nurse and as a masters student, and will bring that same level of commitment to the commission as well.
