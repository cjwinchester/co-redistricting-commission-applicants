<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
As a member of Heritage Camps for Adoptive Families, we advocated for transracially adopted families
of all ethnic groups and genders. I helped organize family camps for several ethnicities as well as other
activities for families to educate, and provide social spaces for children to be with families who are in
similar situations.
In TUFIR we actively supported students and adults who were in the GEO ICE facility, and also
immigrants that were newly released from the facility. We provided food, clothing and money as support
as well as letters to ICE and our school district in support of immigrants. We also held training seminars
for adults and students on knowing your rights.
As the lead mentor for our FIRST Robotics team I advocated for kids of all ethnicities, genders and
abilities to have a true STEM experience. I started two teams, one in each school I was at, and
spearheaded fundraising for each team, and outreach to elementary and middle schools about robotics and
STEM.
In my church I have been a teacher of both adults and children, choir director, and volunteer with several
service projects.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As a high school science teacher I have had the opportunity to work with young adults on a daily basis,
both in and out of the classroom. They are generally more candid and to the point than adults and seeing
things from their viewpoint is a valuable tool that I will bring to the commission.
I am a woman, of Asian descent, from a rural community, currently living in a suburban area. Growing
up, I understood the high cost of farming, and how things could turn with an untimely storm or drought,
as well as the magic of watching a crop grow, and the value of a hard day&#39;s work. My Asian heritage
provides background knowledge on the minority experience of racial and cultural discrimination. Being a
woman and adoptive mother provides additional lenses to view life. Finding one’s identity is especially
difficult for an adopted child who must sort through abandonment issues, and racial issues compounding
the already complex task of growing up. Women face every day challenges of balancing work and family,
often providing care for elderly parents and sick family members.
Fair maps will help ensure that each vote counts equally, and areas will not be skewed to the advantage of
any particular group or party. Fair maps will ensure our election officials accurately represent their
constituents.
Volunteering on several campaigns at the local, state and national levels has shown me the importance of
the election process in the preservation of our democracy. Working in public schools and engaging kids
in extracurricular activities gave me the opportunity to work with parents, professionals in the community,
and motivated students. These groups see things from slightly different viewpoints and it is a valuable
lesson in broadening my perspectives when interacting with a wide variety of groups.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
When I had conferences with parents and students, I always allowed the parent and student to speak first,
so I could understand where they were coming from and gauge their level of frustration with the situation.
Using appropriate empathetic verbiage, I could attempt to get us both on the same page for goals, and
work backward to determine what actions would be needed to achieve those common goals.
Each year the robotics team has to tackle the challenge of designing and building a robot to play a new
game designed by engineers at FIRST. Our team consists of high school students, teachers, and engineer
mentors from the community. We established norms developed by our leadership team and mentors. At
the brainstorming session we announce and emphasize that everyone&#39;s opinion is important and worth
hearing. We divide into small groups, and after everyone has presented, make a list of pros and cons for
each idea. This helps make the process objective and is a framework for collaboration I would bring to
the commission.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a scientist, critical thinking, research, analysis and communication skills are vital to what we do. On
our learning team, as teachers, we collected data, analyzed, reported out and modified by consensus our
teaching methods to improve student achievement. We always worked within a strict budget to purchase
chemicals and equipment. As a teacher, I taught students about the importance of producing data,
analyzing the data, checking for error and causes of error, and coming to conclusions based on data and
analysis.
As lead mentor for robotics I was in charge of creating and maintaining a budget to build the robot and
participate in competitions in and out of state. Engineering requires critical thinking and analytic skills to
design a robot that not only functions on paper, but also in real life competitions over several days.
During the build season we strategize, prototype, analyze and communicate to determine the best design.
We are constantly testing, analyzing and reworking designs. As is evident, I am very adept at not only
utilizing analytical skills, but also teaching them.
