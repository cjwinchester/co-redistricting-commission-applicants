<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>

Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As patrons of the arts, my wife and I believe in the journey that a person goes through achieving mastery in music opens up the world; once you have mastered any one thing through practice, you can learn almost anything through failing enough until you get it.  We approach organizing in music through community orchestras, a community college, and charities that provide opportunities for kids to get excited about something to which they might not otherwise have access.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that every voter&#39;s opinion should be treated equally, to the extent possible.  Partisan attempts to predetermine outcomes are anathema to that ideal of equality.  I want to ensure that modern statistical methods for measuring equality are adequately represented in the approach that the Commission uses when drawing boundaries.  Although I am not an expert in these methods at the moment, I have the mathematical and engineering background to both learn enough about what is needed myself, as well as relationships in the software and data science communities to bring in serious expertise as necessary.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The building and determination of consensus is a core part of the Internet standards process, where I am a long-term participant.  As the chair of several working groups at the IETF, I often had to argue my personal points separately from my determination of the consensus of the group, even when that consensus was against my preferences.  It took practice, mentoring from others, and struggling to understand all of the arguments put forth in RFC 7282 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7282) to arrive at my current approach, which I hope to continue to hone.  With the Internet, interoperability is more important than any one person winning -- with voting, the belief that the system is fair, that all votes will have equal weight is also more important than any one person or a side winning.  I will bring the same level of impartiality to my work on the commission that I have to other similar endeavors.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My degree in Mechanical Engineering (Virginia Tech, 1993, Cum Laude) honed my analytical skills.  We were taught to break any large problem down into smaller problems that we already knew how to solve, and instilled the belief that all problems are solvable with enough effort.  Although the &quot;all problems are solvable&quot; mentality has proven to be more than a little naive when faced with the non-technical issues that dominated the later portions of my career (budgets, personnel, structure, culture), the optimism to continue looking for solutions has continued to be valuable to me.  I have a 30 year history of using those logical skills in diverse ways, transitioning them to software, Internet protocol development, and executive leadership.  At Mozilla, we analyzed massive amounts of imprecise data from Firefox to try to figure out how to build the best web browser possible for our users, while respecting the privacy of those users.  I believe that this set of analytic approaches mirrors some of the trade-offs that will be necessary in redistricting work.
