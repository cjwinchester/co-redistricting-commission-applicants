        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Kristina DeHerrera</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Kristina DeHerrera
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Kristina Garcia</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Patent Examiner, United States Patent and Trademark Office
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a JD from Colorado Law-UC Boulder and a bachelors in Chemical Engineering from CSU
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80123
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I donated $50 to the Biden campaign this year for my brother&#39;s birthday request but have not made any other donations that I can recall since November 10, 2015. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Court Support Jeffco Board of Directors, Garcia Foundation Board of Directors, Hispanic National Bar Association, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, Society of Women Engineers, Colorado Hispanic Bar Association, Colorado Bar Association, Crestview HOA Board of Directors, volunteer with Colorado Legal Services Rural Clinic program
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I grew up in a house where charity and community were a large part of our lives and I have been involved in multiple organizations in a variety of roles.  I have worked with brand new non-profits, like the Garcia Foundation, as they determine their direction and start taking the first steps to achieving their goals, I’ve worked with more established non-profits, like the Latina Safehouse, as they navigate growth and the ultimate challenge of how to engage the broader community in their work, and I’ve also worked with large state and national organizations.  Court Support Jeffco is a non-profit I’ve worked with for the last eight years.  Finding community interest and support has been difficult at times. Even my husband didn’t understand why I was raising money to help people who were addicted to drugs and alcohol.  Through this experience, I have learned how to advocate for alternative courts and the recovery community while also being able to explain to other people why their support of this organization benefits them as an investment into their own community.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As a resident of Pueblo, Fort Collins, Boulder, Denver, and now Littleton as well as a property owner in Winter Park and Antonito, I have an appreciation for the variety of people and places in Colorado.  Having our districts represent that diversity is important. I was excited to hear that our state was moving to the commissions and I chose to apply once I learned more about what they do. Problem solving and data analysis are two of my strengths, which make me an asset to the commission while also doing something I get excited about.  My team mentality and organization skills have served me well in leadership positions large and small and I look forward to the opportunity to give back to my home state.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a leader in many of the organizations I have been a part of, the ability to promote consensus has been a key to both individual and group success.  It can be as small deciding whether to fundraise for water bottles vs hats for a work event or as big as working to make a plan to safely maximize a child’s time with their parents that addresses the wants and needs of the family and the department of human services. I have found that the best way to contribute to agreement is to make each side feel heard.  By listening and starting with commonalities we are generally able to make progress toward an agreement.  While not everyone is always satisfied with the outcome, no one should feel completely overlooked.  My involvement in family court cases helped increase my ability to be impartial.  Those meetings were never about who ‘won’ but rather about what was best for the child. By remembering what the end goal is, it was easier to remain impartial.  I have been able to take that experience and translate the skills into work, volunteer, and personal relationships.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
 Being both an engineer and an attorney, logic and analysis are the bedrock of my education and career. I got a perfect score on the logical reasoning portion of the LSAT, I get excited to do logic puzzles when the opportunity arises, and my friends and coworkers tease me for how much I use excel. As a lab manager for Anheuser-Busch, data analysis was one of the most important part of my job.  I monitored millions of data points to ensure that we were putting out a consistent high-quality product while maximizing efficiency and reducing waste.  
Last year, I received a large, incomplete, and somewhat incorrect data set that was meant to guide our office meetings for the rest of the year. I took the lead to organize and complete the data. Once complete, I created one Excel workbook to sort and filter the data and see what was wrong or missing and mapped all of the locations so we could plan visits to minimize travel time.  At the end of the year, we were the only office to meet the goal set by headquarters as well as providing them information on the accuracy of the data they had originally pulled.
