        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for John M. Fernandez</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  John M. Fernandez
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>John Manuel Fernandez</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am retired. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a masters degree in urban and regional planning as well as a bachelor&#39;s degree in journalism. I was a certified planner during my career (American Institute of Certified Planners). 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80220
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
The bulk of my professional career was spent in city planning, work which is quintessentially advocacy on behalf of the community at large and the myriad groups, neighborhoods, special interests and underrepresented factions which comprise our urban areas. I developed comprehensive plans in the cities of Aurora, Boulder and Glenwood Springs, documents which ultimately derive their authority from the people and businesses proactively engaged in a rational and deliberate process managed by city officials. I continue that work today as chair of The Fax Partnership board as we engage with the city of Denver in development of the East Area Plan. I also have experience in non-governmental settings. For example, I served three years on the state board of the Colorado Mountain Club and as chair of the Boulder Group of the CMC. The CMC is a venerable Colorado organization dedicated to conservation of the Colorado back country and the education of back country users. Population growth, climate change and the shift away from social organizations were among the challenges addressed while I was in a leadership position with the CMC. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My political activity has been limited to posting of yard signs and making financial contributions to individual campaigns (e.g., Andrew Romanoff, Jason Crow, Tom Tobiassen [Aurora City Council]. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Since my retirement in August 2015, the bulk of my volunteer activity has been on behalf of The Fax Partnership, a non-profit whose mission is support of existing residents and businesses and promotion of equitable redevelopment along the East Colfax corridor. I currently serve as board chair. I have done limited amounts of volunteer work for Habitat for Humanity with plans to do more once the pandemic eases. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have become concerned with the increasing polarization of the U.S. body politic, a trend exacerbated by district gerrymandering that creates safe seats for relatively extreme elected officials who eschew compromise on behalf of the greater good in favor of merely scoring political or ideological points. I see an analogy with the shift away from beneficial debate within legislatures to reliance on petitions and constitutional amendments (TABOR, Gallagher, Amendment 23 etcetera). Competitive congressional districts would increase the potential for beneficial exchange of ideas among our elected leaders. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Drafting comprehensive plans for a city, such as I have done in three Colorado cities, can only be successful by managing a project based on community engagement and the pursuit of consensus. A city planner can only succeed to the extent to which they are perceived as fair and trustworthy. The issues of land use, development rights, environmental protection and community goals are highly contentious and can only be resolved if those entrusted with the planning process do their job in a fair and impartial manner. Similarly, in every professional or organizational setting, I have been selected to a leadership position whether that has been with a city (Aurora, Boulder, Glenwood Springs), a non-profit (Colorado Mountain Club, The Fax Partnership) or even with a social group (A.P.E.S, the Architects, Planners and Engineers of Garfield County). I have also managed large groups of professionals, for example, a staff of 13 in my service as Aurora&#39;s Manager of Comprehensive Planning. One can succeed in such a setting only as a servant leader, mediating conflicts, giving a voice to all participants, being an honest broker among competing interests and maintaining a focus on the organization&#39;s goal. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
City planning is all about analyzing existing conditions, developing a vision and goals, then applying logic to devise potential solutions. A particular challenge facing planners is the need to avoid unintended consequences when drafting comprehensive plans, development codes or zoning regulations. This requires attention to the big picture while at the same time attention to detail in the drafting of policies, regulations and processes. Regarding this commission&#39;s task, some of my work experience with the city of Aurora is particularly relevant, including: responsibility for the city&#39;s population forecast; calculation of future land use needs and development patterns; and, testimony in a district court case supporting the city&#39;s interest in being located wholly within one congressional district following results of the 2010 federal census.
