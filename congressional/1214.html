        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Kristiana Marguerite Huitron</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Kristiana Marguerite Huitron
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Kristiana M. Huitron, Kristiana Huitron</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently the Executive Director for a community-based victim service nonprofit in Colorado Springs, Colorado. I have been in the business of victim advocacy for 17 years and have been working in cultural community-based nonprofits since 1990; whether I lived in urban Denver, or rural Nebraska, or in the growing and progressing Colorado Springs. You will see in my resume that I have served community in local, statewide, and national positions as a technical assistance provider for victim service nonprofits in a variety of settings. 

</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have earned a GED from the Emily Griffith School of opportunity in 1989 when I left South High School in Denver’s Washington Park neighborhood which is the same school from which my parents graduated and where they met. I attended the Community College of Denver until I became pregnant and left school to raise my children and take care of my family. As an adult, I attended the Women’s College at the University of Denver but have not completed the degree requirements
Over the past 20 years I have built a solid career as a victim advocate, a technical assistance provider, a researcher, and a trainer. I have recently become an unlicensed psychotherapist in the state of Colorado and am attending a yearlong certification course for MindBody Therapy. While I continue to hold out for finishing my university degree one day, over the course of my life I have educated myself, being well read and well mentored. I have attended at least 30 hours of continuing education training in each of the last 20 years. 

</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80916
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I have many years of experience in organizing, advocating for, and considering the interests of people impacted by violence crime, people impacted by social disparities, as well as with cultural communities seeking healing and well-being.  As an anti-domestic violence advocate, a trainer, a coalition staff member, a person engaged in community research, and through other related roles, I have worked to hear directly from people who are impacted, and to work with individuals and communities to find practical ways forward.  I look forward to bringing this perspective and skill set to the commission’s work on redistricting. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My political activity has primarily consisted of being an informed voter.  Policy issues impact communities, and I take my right to vote seriously.  In addition,my very first donation to a political candidate was to Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary. I have since donated to the National Democratic Party over this past year, usually in amounts of $5-25 dollars. I have also made a contribution to Colorado Senator Julie Gonzalez’ campaign in a similar amount.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am presently on the Domestic Violence Offender Management Board (DVOMB) under the Department of Criminal Justice (DCJ) in the state of Colorado. 
I am a member of the Colorado Association of Psychotherapists. 
The organization, for which I work, is a member of Violence Free Colorado (the state coalition against domestic violence).
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the commission for multiple reasons.
First, I was asked to apply by someone I respect and admire as a leader in the city. I want to honor that request, and their recognition of me in the community, as a trusted person. 
Also, I love Colorado. This is my home, where I was born, and raised and have worked and built my life. I have benefited from this state and have on purpose made this my home. 
In different professional roles I have had the opportunity to see the majority of the state with my own heart and eyes. As a child, being a native of Colorado, I traveled and stayed with family in different parts in most of Southern Colorado and along what is now known as the Front Range. I feel connected to rural and frontier Colorado as well as urban centers because of my time in and connections with colleagues, friends, and family who span all of Colorado. 
I come from a multi-racial, economically and politically diverse family. This helps me to aim for options that serve the well-being of all of us. I also know what it is like to move through social tiers and change one’s life trajectory through hard work and participation in the system. I am a testament to that. 
Finally, having built my career and gained professional respect through what some would call, my own gumption, it is also through the network of generous mentors and knowledgeable guides. Many people of many walks have invested in my success. It is my purpose and choice to continue to invest in our collective good and my beloved Colorful Colorado. This commission has a worthy purpose, and I believe I will be able to contribute meaningfully to the commission’s work. 

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Differing perspectives are important and valuable in building good solutions, so disagreement is not a problem, but rather an indication that indeed people are putting forward their contribution.  Moving forward once many views have been expressed is then the work of respectful dialogue, listening and considering as well as speaking. When others at the table feel heard and respected, we can talk about solutions or compromises without any personal disrespect. Keeping our eyes on the values and the goals that the commission is tasked with can help in seeing that we are all working on behalf of something none of us can achieve individually.  Fairness and impartiality in terms of respectful inclusion, while being values-led, is a cornerstone of much of the work that I do in my professional life.  

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My natural perspective tends to be strategy and reason. As a person who has had a life full of diversity of social conditions and variety of people and locations, I find that my logical mind is well-balanced with the human relationships that surround me in life. 
In my work I have worked on research teams as support and as co-investigator. I have the ability to connect, value and evaluate the data that research provides. DAta helps to shape policy. In my work, I have also provided connection and support for many victims of violence, having to provide a compassionate connection and support people in learning about and maneuvering with some sense of capacity, the various systems with which a victim of crime can come into contact. I have developed over the years a fair balance of logic and reason with humanity and fairness. Data cannot live in a vacuum, it must be applied to the society in which we all live. Anecdote alone cannot be that which creates guidelines and policy, and it has a place to inform the rules of engagement.
