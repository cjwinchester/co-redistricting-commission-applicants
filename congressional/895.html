        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Maren Elizabeth Soreide</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Maren Elizabeth Soreide
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Assistant Director of Leadership Annual Giving, Colorado State Unversity
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Bachelor of Arts in Political Science, Colorado State University, 2012
Master of Science in Organizational Leadership, Colorado State University - Global, in progress: anticipated graduation date June 2022
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80535
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I was asked to facilitate the Board of Directors retreat for NoCo Equality, an LGBTQ organization in Fort Collins. During this process, I helped the group clearly define board members&#39; responsibilities and expectations, strategize actionable goals for the short and long term, and determine strategies to improve communication between members to reduce misunderstandings.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My past political activity has mostly involved making financial contributions to democratic campaigns, both locally and nationally. I have donated approximately $250/annually to political campaigns, but that number has likely increased during this general election cycle as I have made gifts to PACs support Joe Biden and the Biden-Harris campaign directly. Additionally, I organized friends and family to write postcards to swing-state voters to encourage them to vote on Tuesday, Nov. 3rd, 2020.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
As referenced in my resume, I am an active and engaged member in my community. I have organized and participated in many different “single-day” volunteer activities as an employee of the United Way of Larimer County and a member of the Junior League of Fort Collins. I served as a commissioner for the City of Loveland Human Services Commission for three years and currently sit on the Laporte Area Planning Advisory Committee. Additionally, I am a weekly volunteer for Meals on Wheels – Fort Collins, an organization that coordinates volunteers to provide a hot noontime meal and social interaction to homebound seniors. I am also a member of the United Way of Larimer County Community Impact Committee and work with other members to distribute grant funding to local nonprofits and human services organizations. Additional relevant volunteer or community engagement experience is listed below :
Facilitator, Northern Colorado Equality Board of Directors annual retreat, February 2019
Member, Junior League of Fort Collins 2018-2020
Commissioner, City of Loveland Human Services Commission 2016-2019
Member, Generation United (United Way YPO) 2016-present
Co-Chair, Breast Cancer Recovery Benefit for a community member, raising over $16k 2015

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
This commission represents a wonderful opportunity to spotlight Colorado’s commitment to equity in representation. Fair mapping is critical to democracy, and it would be a privilege to bring my unique set of skills to this work. As I have mentioned, I am an active member of the Fort Collins community and choose to do so because the work genuinely enriches my life. I am happiest when I am of service and feel like my work is making a difference in the lives of others. The opportunity to support the efforts to ensure that the people of Colorado are fairly represented for the next decade and be part of the group that lays the groundwork for future commissions would be a privilege.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am highly intuitive and quickly able to read and respond to individual and group dynamics while building trust and holding space for thoughtful and solution-based collaboration. I am an adept communicator, always with the express intent of ensuring that all participants feel valued and heard. My past work as a commissioner for the Human Services Commission for the City of Loveland and my current appointment on the United Way of Larimer County Community Impact Committee have provided ample opportunities to practice collaboration and reaching consensus. Both groups are comprised of community members who come together to determine how best to support the efforts of local human services agencies and not-for-profits, using either state funding or private impact philanthropy. It likely isn’t a surprise that the total requests for funding far outpace the amount of award dollars available in most funding cycles. Thus, the distribution of these awards always requires thoughtful, careful consideration on the part of committee members, and then collaborative and productive conversations to reach consensus on how best to award grants strategically to achieve the best possible outcomes for our community.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am highly organized with a sharp eye for detail and have a variety of past experiences that highlight my analytical skills. I have undertaken multiple projects at work that require strategic planning, collaboration, and project management. I am currently managing a complex fundraising strategy for emerging infectious disease research in the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at Colorado State University. This project involves many different stakeholders and collaboration across multiple college and central university units. I am also pursuing a Master’s degree in Organizational Leadership, which offers a significant opportunity to further develop my critical thinking, research, and communication competencies.
