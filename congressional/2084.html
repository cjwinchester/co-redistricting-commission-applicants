        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Laura L Lewis</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Laura L Lewis
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Laura Lyn Lockwood</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently retired, but do substitute teach for the St. Vrain Valley School District, from which I retired in 2018 after 34 years at Longmont Junior High School and Sunset Middle School in Longmont, Colorado. I taught Language Arts primarily for 12 years, science for 18 and drama for 4 years. Several years I also taught classes in computer programming, math, and social studies. I coached both the volleyball and track girls&#39; teams multiple years; was sponsor for the student council for several years. 
I&#39;ve substituted all 3 years since retirement, at all levels and for all subjects. 
Additionally, this summer and fall 2020 I also worked as an enumerator for the U.S. census. 

</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I grew up in Wheatland, WY, and attended grade, middle and high school there, graduating in 1977. 
I then attended Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, WA, for 2 years before transferring to the Washington State University in Pullman, WA. I graduated from WSU in 1982 with a BA in English, and minors in computer science and math. I continued at WSU to graduate in 1984 with an additional BA in Secondary Education. I completed my student teaching at Taipei American School in Taipei, Taiwan.
After teaching at Longmont Junior High School for a number of years, I returned to school, earning my Master&#39;s in Secondary Educational Administration in 1990.
As I continued teaching I continued to take secondary and graduate level courses at various universities in this area including Colorado State University, Adams State University, CU Boulder, Denver University, and the School of Mines. Most of these classes were in science, so that I now have an official minor in science as well.

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My political activity consists mostly of walking precincts on behalf of educationally minded candidates and issues. (Mill levies, bond issues, state propositions and amendments, Obama, Clinton, eg.) In the past 5 years I have donated to: the Democratic National Committee, the National Education Fund, the America Civil Liberties Union, the Hillary Victory Fund, the Democratic Congressional Campaign, the League of Women Voters, the League of Conservation Voters, the 21st Century Democrats, the DCCC, the Colorado Fund for Children and Public Education, the Weld County Democrats, and to Act Blue. (My typical donation per cycle is $25-$50, so that all together my donations have equaled less than $700 since 2017.)
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I belong to and/or contribute to numerous charitable organizations. In just 2020 I have donated to the Arbor Day Foundation, Women for Women International, Rails to Trails, Doctors Without Borders, the Salvation Army, Mercy Corps, the Denver Rescue Mission, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, the Environmental Defense Fund, Episcopal Relief and Development Fund, the Nature Conservancy, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Carbon Valley Rotary, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, and St. Joseph&#39;s Indian School. I believe my donations to the Democrats makes me a member of those organizations as well.
Since 2017 (and mostly before!) I have been an active member of these organizations (not just dues or donations to): Habitat for Humanity (2 builds), St. Brigit&#39;s Episcopal Church (appointed: Bishop&#39;s Committee Community 3 years, S. School, and more), Wheatland, WY Kiwanis (working their eclipse site and breakfast), Bread for the World (congressional contacts), Longmont Theatre Company (usher and set painting), National and Colorado Public Radio (feedback groups), Colorado Collaborative Rain Hail and Snow (CoCoRHS gauge monitor), Washington State University Alumni Association, University of Northern Colorado Alumni, Colorado State Thespians (2 years group leader and participant), Wildlands Restoration Volunteers (worked 8 projects), St. Vrain Valley Education Association (served as a building Association Representative for 30 years, and on Board of Directors for 12 years, elected Treasurer and Elections Chair), Northern Colorado Retired Educators Association (currently serve on the Board of Directors as social contact),  Delta Kappa Gamma (currently serve on the Board of Directors as Treasurer), Compassion International (sponsor and local presenter), the Longmont Chorale (singing member).
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have a great deal of experience in organizing. As a teacher I, of course, organized courses, curriculum, and assessments. I also was the lead in organizing several field trips every year to various sites in Colorado. I also led 6 different groups on week-long field trips to Washington, D.C. These all involved coordinating with sites, parents, getting legal permission, and speakers/presenters. Additionally, I served the District on leadership teams for , and gifted education, language arts (creating curriculum and content, and on cross-District grading standards), and science (creating the Environmental Education curriculum and field trip content). 
I have represented and advocated for teachers and public education my entire career and on many levels. I served my building as the Association Representative, and then on the SVVEA BOD. I was a Delegate for SVVEA to the Colorado Education Association Delegate Assembly at least 15 times, and to the National Education Association Representative Assembly 4 times. I represented SVVEA on the CEA BOD as an alternate. As an SVVEA BOD member, I represented the teachers to the St. Vrain Valley School District School Board. 
I have lobbied my representatives a few times in person (CEA Lobby Days at the Colorado Capital and for Bread for the World in Washington, D.C., as well as numerous rallies such as Red For Ed and the Women&#39;s March). I write letters, write emails, and make phone calls several times a year to both my National and State Representatives and Senators, and I am on most of their mailing lists.
I have advocated for all my students and their families--poor and rich, gifted and special needs. While teaching I strove to include lessons from America&#39;s history concerning race, voting, and equitable access to resources such as food and water. Toward that end, I contributed to the inclusion of the International Towne curriculum and endeavored to implement the International Baccalaureate program at my school, as I believe there is always another point of view that needs fair and full consideration.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that all citizens deserve fair representation, no matter their incomes, color, heritage, religion or party affiliation.
I believe that Gerrymandering is out-and-out wrong. One of my favorite units as a student was a simulation of redistricting an artificial city. I loved working with others who represented different interests to solve this problem.
I feel that I can listen to and creatively work with others to create equitable solutions.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In many of the activities I have been involved with as an educator and community member, I have had to come to agreements--often with complete consensus. I know this is very time-consuming and sometimes frustrating, but I have come to see that compromise, even while standing up for the basic &quot;rules and requirements&quot;, can be achieved with creativity and good-intentioned work from all sides. I believe I can be fair and impartial, as I had to practice that every year I conducted the elections for both SVVEA and twice for CEA.
For example, during this latest election cycle I tried very hard to get input from all sides--listening primarily to NPR/CPR for my news, but also MSNBC and Fox to hear what each side was saying about various issues. I rarely forward or share digital content, and never anything that I haven&#39;t checked out on a fact-checking site like Snopes. Most often I am the one to &quot;calm the room&quot;. I do not accept alternate facts, but do acknowledge that everyone has a unique set of experiences which affect their reasoning--including me.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I believe teaching, especially at the middle school level is a constant analytic and logic problem. There is always the need to analyze a student&#39;s work or mien or words to determine where a misunderstanding has crept in OR where there is a flash of creativity or genius showing. A teacher has to apply logic to find the right mix of groups or activities in every class every day, as well as work within the state and district standards and the school calendar to help all students move ahead! My favorite pass times are logic problems such as Hashi/Bridges where there are rules and a spatial element to solving the problem that usually requires a second, third or even more reconsiderations and revisions to solve the problem.
