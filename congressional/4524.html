        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Mary Colleen Bryan</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Mary Colleen Bryan
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Mary C Bryan, Mary Bryan, Colleen Bryan</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  In 2002, I retired as a manager from a career with the State of Colorado that began with statewide planning, systems and program development and culminated in a focus on health outcomes, equity and access.  Since then, I have been a caregiver for a disabled family member, been self-employed as a writer, grant-writer, and analyst, and continue to volunteer extensively.  (See resume.)
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Masters in Public Administration, Graduate School of Public Affairs, University of Colorado Denver
Bachelors of Arts, Concentration in Human Services to Children and Families, Loretto Heights College, Denver
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80210
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am registered as a Democrat and contribute financially to selected candidates across the US more frequently than I do to the Democratic Party.  I doubt I can make a comprehensive list of contributions, but I contributed widely to democratic candidates in critical races both in 2016 and 2020.  I know that I have contributed to campaigns for Andrew Romanoff, John Hickenlooper, Elizabeth Warren, Julian Castro, Biden/Harris, Jon Ossoff, Raphael Warnock, Amy McGrath, Corey Booker, Mark Kelly, Sara Gideon, Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, Stacey Abrams. I also frequently contribute financially to specific campaigns for initiatives I intend to vote for. Common ones for me to support are initiatives promoting justice for Black and Native American lives, immigrants, LGBTQ, a woman&#39;s right to choose, environmental justice, and criminal justice reform.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
First Unitarian Society of Denver, American Civil Liberties Union, American Friends Service Committee Immigration Justice groups, Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition, Metro Denver Sanctuary Coalition, Family Promise (homelessness services), National Association for the Mentally Ill, Black Lives Matter
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I participate in forums and provide feedback on public documents related to proposed environmental regulations or changes to use of force policies for local law enforcement.  I have often helped non-profit organizations revise/organize their internal processes and plans for the future (i.e. leading revisioning and strategic planning efforts, serving on capital campaign steering, serving on finance and personnel committees).  I volunteer extensively to support civil and human rights across class, gender, race, sexual identity and citizenship status.  I volunteer service to people experiencing mental illness and homelessness. As a member of a multi-racial family (Native American, Black and White) I have learned  to refrain from asserting my white privilege in our shared initiatives but to leave space to center and support the leadership of people of color.  When I became aware of this (Commission) application process, I reached out to several black and brown friends to encourage their applications.  (Hope you get them, and if so, feel free to set this one aside!)
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
In recognition of the risk that gerrymandering poses to our democracy I voted for the two initiatives creating the Redistricting Commissions.  I heard yesterday that you were short of applications and needed more, particularly from diverse representatives.  I have solid skills in systems analysis and design from my career with State Government, as well as a knowledge of regional and parochial issues from extensive travel throughout the state.  I have time now freed from heavy caregiver responsibilities that have absorbed much of my past 18 years.  I am keenly interested in public service and participatory democracy and drawn more toward bi-partisan and non-partisan voter protection and engagement activities. This is a contribution to my beloved Colorado of a type and scope that I can make.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As I enter this process, I am not invested in any agenda or specific solution other than correcting for the distortion that gerrymandering imposes on the public voice. In group processes where I am not representing a specific agenda, I look to highlight the threads of commonality among stakeholders.  It helps to identify core essentials, greatest fears, things that are tolerable vs. bells and whistles for each. As we move toward solutions that can give the most people what they need even if you can’t fulfill all of anyone’s ambitions. I elicit and try to center the voices of marginalized people in every discussion of resource allocation, recognizing they are often not at the table or not empowered when there.  I seek to elicit their concerns and build a remedy to their issues into every solution. I have a good critical mind but my strongest motivation is in seeking the satisfying &quot;click&quot; of a solution that all can endorse rather than trying to run away with any solitary prize.  
A fair, transparent process can produce a shared sense of ownership that energizes people to move forward. A process that is perceived as unfair or non-inclusive leaves people feeling blocked, angry or (worst) disconnected from their democracy. I don&#39;t take public comments personally, but I do take them seriously. And that tends to be recognized, respected, and translate to productive public meetings.
Regarding fellow commissioners: others will come into the process from a host of other places and contexts. Some may have very real agendas that they are driven to pursue. Identifying early on some real value that each other commissioner and colleague brings to the process helps me focus on their value later down the line, when political pressures and deadlines can cause the process to rock and roll.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am skilled at listening to, gathering and synthesizing public input. My work in long-range planning and revisioning with non-profits requires one to bring logic and reason to quite varied problem sets. I have an innate sense of how systems are likely to work once constructed, which joints are likely to hobble, which pipes are likely to swell or break. Throughout my government career, I specialized in tackling large systemic problems and leading the initial analysis phase to define scope and a solution before handing it over to other teams for technical implementation. I have applied logic and reason to business process redesign and automation, and information systems replacements. (See selected resume, attached.) I applied skills in public input gathering and statewide infrastructure assessment with the Governor’s Blue Ribbon Panel, culminating in Colorado’s first infrastructure development budget.  I did similar work for the Governor’s Commission on State and Local Government Financing, for a multi-year aging plan, and in the scope development phase of the CBMS project.  
In all these applications, I found it useful to remember that whatever project I am working on intersects different interests and groups in different parts of the state in their different economies, geography, cultures, and politics. Through those lenses, my mission is perceived as either an opportunity or a threat that might be quite separate from what I am commissioned to do.  I can respect these alternate realities without falling captive to them, see where our purposes might align, glean what I can or at least avoid harm, and move along
