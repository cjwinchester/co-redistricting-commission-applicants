</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
As a teacher of teenagers, I organize and consider the interests of various groups on a regular basis.  Teaching, especially currently, involves multiple stakeholders with a variety of priorities.  Finding the right path that meets the needs of the variety of families involved takes patience, communication skills, creative problem solving and planning.  I am not afraid to speak up to help to make sure the best solution is found.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am politically active in that I keep myself and my neighbors politically informed.  As a secondary social studies teacher, I also keep my students informed of current and historical political trends.  I have not belonged to any political organizations since college in the late 1990s.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Since I have two sons, I have been active in the local scouting community.  I was Treasurer for Pack 548 from 2015-2017, and during this time we increased our membership from 12 scouts in grades 1-5 to over 30.  Other community organizations that I have been involved in in the last five years have been my local PTA, and Jeffco Eats, an organization that helps with food insecurity among school age children. I also have taken part in the annual Point in Time count of the homeless population for the last several years. I have been active at meetings for these groups but have not held a leadership position in them.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Primarily, I want to serve on the commission because of my deep felt belief in &quot;one man, one vote&quot;.  I have taught citizenship to middle schoolers and high schoolers who a required to take it as well as adults who are voluntarily taking their US citizenship test.  I am proud to be a part of this process.  I am a first generation American, and my immigrant mother instilled in me her belief of the privilege of voting and the responsibilities that come with it.  I agree with Winston Churchill when he said, &quot;Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.&quot;  It may be messy, but the voting process in the US is the best way to balance all the competing ideas and interests while still maintaining both freedom and order.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I teach history, politics and government during a time when people are afraid to discuss these topics with their friends, much less strangers.  I pride myself on the fact that my students regularly ask me whether I am conservative or liberal because they can not figure it out based on my comments in class.  Just as I create an environment of fair and moderated discussion in a classroom, I believe I would be able to do the same on the commission.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a person, I am very logical and analytical.  When I give my students an assessment, I also assess myself as a teacher.  Using the data of both the content of the questions missed as well as the type of question missed, I can assess whether it was a topic that I need to cover more versus a type of question that the students struggled with.  In addition to gathering data after the fact, I use pre-tests to help guide curriculum choices.  Collecting, collating, and analyzing data is a large part of the educational environment today,  and I use those skills regularly.
