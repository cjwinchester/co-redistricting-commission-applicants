</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
     I chaired the Montview Garden Columbarium Commission for four years, from 2015-2019, at the Montview Boulevard Presbyterian Church in Denver. The Commission cares for the Columbarium (an interment garden for ashes), makes future management and operational decisions, and encourages crypt sales. During my tenure as Chair, I collected, culled through, and organized many disparate collections of Columbarium documents from its 35+ years of operation, updated its policies and procedures, researched, prepared and implemented requirements to protect and add to its endowment fund, updated sales documents used by the Church and prepared other management documents for staff use, and worked with new staff to update sales records. I also worked with staff to write down its procedures for the sales, recording, and implementing interments, and did the same for the Commission.    
     I have been involved in an Indivisible Group during the 2020 election cycle. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I had been involved for many years as a board member with my Registered Neighborhood Organization, Greater Park Hill Community Inc., in Denver for many years. During this time, I was heavily involved in reviewing and commenting on Denver&#39;s last rezoning and its earlier Quick Wins zoning law.
     In retirement, I did paralegal work for a Sierra Club-funded legal action. (I am not a member of the Colorado bar and my D.C. bar membership is inactive.)
   As a member of our local Community Garden (through Denver Urban Gardens), I wrote a successful grant application from a national organization, which awarded the group $2,500.
    Although this was not a Colorado activity, I was involved with a group of D.C. attorneys who established the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless in the early 1990&#39;s.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to see Colorado become a model for redistricting, just as it is a model for voting by mail. I believe that partisan gerrymandering is a destructive influence nationwide and that Colorado can be a leader in ensuring that redistricting is done fairly and by citizens. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
     Although I have supported and worked for Democratic candidates, I am able to be fair and impartial. I believe this ability is grounded in large part in my legal career, first at the D.C. Public Defender Service (1978-82), and then at U.S. DOJ (Environmental Enforcement Section (1982-1998) and Indian Resources Section (1999-2013). At DOJ, I worked under Republican and Democratic administrations (Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama), where my work as a line level attorney and first level supervisor, required the impartial assessment of the law and facts of cases.
     As a DOJ attorney, I had considerable experience in negotiating consensus among large groups of parties with competing interests. For example, the defendants in many of my Superfund cases were numerous big automakers (Ford, GM, etc.), auto supply companies, and large numbers of de minimis parties (cities, towns, small businesses). Their interests, financial abilities, and relative involvement in the contaminated site varied widely and settlement approaches needed to be tailored to their respective situations.  Most of my Indian Resources cases were large water rights cases, in which the tribe (or tribes), States, counties, towns, and ranchers, businesses, etc., had disparate interests that needed to be considered before a settlement could be reached.
     In addition, my US DOJ training and experience required respect of the required public comment phase for any judicially-approved settlement. Every single comment had to be considered and addressed before we could seek judicial approval of a settlement. My experience in Denver with zoning issues is that the City views public comment as a formality to check off before doing what it planned to do originally. To me that is not fair or impartial and is arrogant and disingenuous. I was trained to act otherwise and believe that respect for public comment is critical.  
     This last point may sound odd to some people, but having led litigation teams, I believe that using the pronoun &quot;we&quot; - as opposed to &quot;I&quot; - is important. &quot;What do WE want to do on this issue,&quot; as opposed to &quot;what I want to do&quot; is one way to help a group work together. I have experienced the latter in numerous circumstances, including another Church committee, and always find it off-putting. As an introvert, I am not a fan of a lot of trendy team-building exercises and prefer careful speech that is designed to get a group to work together.    
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have 35 years of experience as an attorney, all of which honed my analytical skills and ability to apply logic and reason to a problem. I was a public defender in the District of Columbia for 6 years, doing juvenile, misdemeanor, felony, and appellate cases. This work required intensive fact investigations and the application of law to those facts, including counseling clients, and pretrial, trial and appellate work. My first 16 years at US DOJ in the Environmental Enforcement Section included client counseling (primarily the Environmental Protection Agency, but also the Departments of Interior and Agriculture), factual and legal analysis of cases, and litigation and settlement of cases. My second stint at US DOJ in the Indian Resources Section required the same skills (this time with the Bureau of Indian Affairs at Interior, as well as with a variety of Indian tribes and their attorneys). 
     I am applying on the last day for applications, so have not had a chance to obtain any letters of recommendation or update my resume. If I make it past the lottery stage, I would be glad to provide letters of recommendation and my resume.
