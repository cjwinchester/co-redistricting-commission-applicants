</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have extensive experience (30 years) in considering the interests of groups, organizations or associations in Colorado. My professional research work utilized a community-based participatory approach with requires the input from and partnership with the communities in which I sought to research.  This included community residents, nonprofit organizations whose constituents were the communities of interest, and other scientists and health care professionals with an interest in reaching the communities in which I was conducting research. I have facilitated Latino focus groups in Colorado, organized and led a robust network of 44 community and scientific partners for addressing Colorado Latino cancer disparities, served as the Chair for the Colorado Cancer Coalition, and served on a previous State Commission-the Colorado Tobacco and Chronic Disease Program as the health disparities expert. All of these activities required considering the interests of a diverse groups.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As a retired person, I have the time to be more involved in civic activities and this is an important task. I have the skills and competencies needed to positively contribute to the work needed for this commission. I consider myself to be fair-minded, am willing and able to collaborate with individuals from diverse political perspectives, and would take the work of this commission seriously. I have previous experience serving on the State Commission on Tobacco and Chronic Disease Programs.  It was an honor and privilege to serve the State of Colorado.  I just recently became aware of this application process and the lack of diversity among applicants, so far.  I think it is important to have a diverse commission that represents the population of Colorado, as much as possible.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Having served on a State Commission in the past (Colorado Tobacco and Chronic Disease Programs), I understand that members will have different views and perspectives that must be seriously considered in order to reach consensus. I will promote consensus by taking my Charge, provided by the State of Colorado, seriously; by committing to listening to my fellow commissioners, and by contributing my knowledge and expertise to discussions and work of the Commission. I do not expect to always get my way and will do my best to work for the good of all the people of Colorado. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a retired PhD researcher in health disparities, I have 30 years experience in applying analytical skills, logic, and reason to complex problems.  I have experience conducting relevant background research (what we already know) to find gaps and develop a methodology for next steps for answering questions. I have experience with statistical inference, data management, reading and evaluating research results, and identifying data limits. Health disparities, my area of expertise, are the result of a complex set of social, behavioral, environmental, and biological factors. I have experience navigating through these factors. To aid in the development of interventions, focusing on social factors for example, we may use tools such as &quot;logic models&quot;.  Such models provide a roadmap for getting from aims to outcomes, relying on evidence provided through the data. In public policy work, which is an end goal of some of these interventions, it is important to first identify and agree on the problem. This seems obvious, but if stakeholders cannot agree on what the problem is...making headway will be very difficult.
