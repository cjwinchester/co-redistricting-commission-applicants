        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Sarah McAfee</h3>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Director of Communications at Center for Health Progress
</p>

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated small amounts to numerous democratic candidates and some non-affiliated candidates since 2015, with at least 90% of those contributions having been made over the past six months in Senate races across the US. Total contributions over the course of the last five years are less than $2,000. I did one afternoon of phone banking with the Obama campaign in 2008 and delivered yard signs for Senator Tammy Story. I have also attended a handful of political rallies and protests. Beyond that, my political activity has been limited to voting. Since I work for a nonprofit with strict rules about political engagement, I have been careful to limit my activities to those that could not harm the tax status of my employer.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Tech4Good, Impact Denver, Communications Network, Colorado Healthcare Communicators
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My work at Center for Health Progress is all about organizing, representing, and advocating for the interests and health of Coloradans, and I have done that work proudly and passionately over the past ten years. As part of a team, I work every day to gather input from communities and community members about their needs and interests and then use that input to help design solutions to some of the most complex challenges we face as a state. I am very familiar with balancing competing interests and values while navigating power imbalances and have lots of experience working with diverse audiences.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
If I&#39;ve learned nothing else from this election season, it&#39;s that our democracy is fragile. Those in power will use any leverage they have to stay in power, and that nearly always infringes on Americans&#39; fundamental right to have their voice heard and their vote count. Colorado is already a leader for the country in its election design, security, and voter turnout, and now we have the opportunity to be a leader for fair elections in another way. I want to be on the commission to protect the value of each Coloradans&#39; vote and the democracy we hold dear.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have training in consensus and facilitation that I practice near-daily in my work. There are many different types of consensus, and understanding the differences and agreeing on a consensus process before each decision is critical to making good decisions that everyone involved feels good about. I would bring that training and my facilitation skills to meetings to ensure all voices are heard and respected. Additionally, fairness and impartiality are important, and as a collective, we will need to agree on what constitutes &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;impartial.&quot; While I will not be impartial in the face of oppression or suppression, my personal stake in the outcome of this process is relatively low, and thus I am more easily able to be fair and seek the solution that brings the most value to the most people.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
When I take the Myers-Briggs test, my &quot;T&quot; score--which is whether a person is more logical and analytical or more intuitive and sensing is so far off the chart it typically extends beyond the limit of the page. I solve logic problems and crossword puzzles for fun. I find big datasets interesting and notice patterns others don&#39;t see. I have solid data analysis technical skills while also understanding that those data points often represent complex human lives. I am curious and ask probing questions that help get to the heart of issues and enjoy challenging myself to see issues from different perspectives and angles to reveal new insights.
