  Alan J. Lipowitz
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a retired small animal veterinary surgeon. I am retired for the past 8 years. I moved to Colorado from Minnesota in 2014. Prior to full retirement I worked one day/week in a specialty veterinary practice. Before joining that practice I taught small animal surgery at the College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota for 27 years. Prior to joining the U of MN faculty I taught at the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, and the College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>

I served as a Captain in the US Army Veterinary Corps (1966-1968) with a one year tour in VietNam. I was awarded a Bronze Star for meritorious service in VietNam.

</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80537
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
By my membership on the Thompson School District Master Planning Committee, the Loveland Police Citizen Advisory Board and a volunteer counselor at Sky High  Hope Camp I have tried to give advice on and advocate for issues that would benefit Loveland residents and students and the surrounding communities.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My wife and I held a campaign rally in our home in Minnesota for Tim Walz (now MN governor) when he first ran for congress. I have given money to several Democratic candidates including President Obama, Senator Paul Wellstone, Congressman Tim Walz, Congressman Joe Neguse, Congressman and Governor Jared Polis, and Vice President Joe Biden. I also gave money and supported Senator Dave Durenberger (Republican) when he ran for US Senate in Minnesota. In addition I have given money to the American Civil Liberties Union.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am presently a member of the Loveland Police Citizen Advisory Board. I was a member of the Master Planning Committee for the Thompson School District in Loveland. For the past 10 years I have been a volunteer counselor here in Colorado for Sky High Hope Camp a week long camp for children with cancer. I was an active member and office holder in the American College of Veterinary Surgeons having been elected to the Board of Regents, President-elect, President, and Chair of the Board of Regents. In addition I was appointed as Executive Secretary of the American College of Veterinary Surgeons, serving in that position for 19 years.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have a deep regard for our ability to vote. I believe voting districts should be a fair representation of those within its boundaries. And, at the same time these boundaries be so constructed as to not give advantage to one party or one elected official or candidate of any party. Our democracy is to be treasured, respected, and protected. Drawing electoral district boundaries should in no way create an unfair advantage for any political/partisan group nor diminish the votes of social or cultural groups.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
During my tenure at the University of Minnesota I served as Chair of the Department of Small Animal Sciences for 4 years. Prior to that I was Head of the Section of Small Animal Surgery. Overseeing and coordinating the activities of these entities requires one to be able to listen to people, to recognize the needs of others, and to make decisions that meet the best needs of all and will be viewed as reflecting common sense, fairness and integrity. I believe I have the ability to work with a variety of people to achieve an outcome that will serve the better good of all. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I believe the skill set necessary to do surgery relies on one&#39;s ability to diagnose a problem and formulate a plan for its resolution. I also believe I have the reputation and capacity for rational thinking and ability to identify and resolve issues in a group setting.
