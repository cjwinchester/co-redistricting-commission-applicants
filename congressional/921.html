        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Joanne M. Stanko</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Joanne M. Stanko
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Jo Stanko</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Retired school teacher and self-employed owner/ manager team member of the Stanko Ranch
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a BA in Education/ with minors in English and Art, an MA in Elementary Education with minors in English and Art, Certification in Public Education Administration.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80487
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I believe my work with both the League of Women Voters and Building a Better Colorado have given me a lot of practice in considering the interest of groups and being a part of consensus building. My work with the Cattlemen&#39;s Beef Board has provided me with the experience to represent a wide and diverse base who may agree or disagree among themselves. I have been able to develop advocating skills through the various levels of training and participation in education and agriculture organizations; such as a member of the National Beef Spokesperson Team, giving testimony before the Colorado House Agriculture Committee concerning the Agricultural Lease Deduction bill, and group meetings concerning the impact of agricultural easements on conservation with the Sand Hill Foundation at the US Department of Agriculture.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s I had served on a number of political action committees for the Colorado Education Association, been a part of three candidate campaigns, been the chair of the county Democratic Party through some 3 election cycles, served as an election judge for over a decade. Since November 10, 2015 , I have donated to Diane Mitsch Bush&#39;s campaigns for 3d Congressional District, the local Democratic Party and I think to Micheal Bennet&#39;s re-election campaign in 2016. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Routt County Democrats, League of Women Voters, Beta Sigma Phi, the cattlewomen&#39;s organizations at the county, state, and national level, Routt County Farm Bureau, Routt County Farmer&#39;s Union, appointed boards at the state Colorado Agricultural Commission and at the national level the Cattlemen&#39;s Beef Board and the Colorado State Farm Services Agency Board.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
 I believe strongly in the doctrine that everyone&#39;s vote should count but the pragmatist in me has seen how important district lines are in making certain that the voices of minority groups are either heard or eliminated. I want to be an advocate for making sure those voices are not eliminated from the conversation.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Building consensus First you take away the win/lose mentality by quickly identifying those things that everyone can agree upon, then going forward you check where the individuals stand on the &quot;I like it, I can live with it, I hate it&quot; level. You hone in on those I hate factors and work through them until you can get them to the I can live with it level. In the classroom, as a chair of a committee, or overseeing a hearing on seeking redress on a governmental program, it&#39;s not about you, it&#39;s about them.  I also think that my 30 years as an educator and the years of participation with the local League of Women Voters; giving presentations on the bills, moderating candidates meetings, and especially consolidating and rephrasing questions to be asked so they don&#39;t show a bias. My goal is to make sure every person and side is presented and I then check not only the facts but the reliability of resources.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have developed the ability to listen and hear what is being said, and what is not being said. I am strong in common sense and have always been a centrist politically and in my life.
