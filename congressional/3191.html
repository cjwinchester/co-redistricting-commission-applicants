        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Holly Gee</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Holly Gee
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently homeschooling my children.  As far as income, I sometimes sell plants and seeds from my garden to supplement my husband&#39;s income.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Elementary Education.  I also went to graduate school for Finance.  I am 2 classes short to graduate so though I finished most of the program, I did not attain a degree (had a baby that year and things changed).  I had a teaching license in the state of California.  I had a license to sell Health and Life insurance in Texas at one point, but chose not to pursue that line of work.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80016
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I was a long time independent voter.  When I moved to Colorado, I had the understanding that independent voters could not participate in the caucus.  So I changed my registration to Democrat at that point and it has remained as such.  This year was the first year I donated to a campaign and that was for Biden.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I haven&#39;t belonged to any of these things int hat time period.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have been incredibly busy homeschooling up until now and although I still homeschool, my children are older, far more independent, and my husband works from home.  It has become more of a joint effort between all involved.  But between my previous career as a teacher and my years homeschooling, I have had plenty of opportunity to keep organized records and work with many groups of people..many types of people.  My husband is a minority.  My children are biracial.  My students in the past were from all walks of life and of all ethnic backgrounds.  I worked for a period at a Title I school near Oakland, CA and also at an all girls private school in San Francisco (consisting of students from two very different socioeconomic backgrounds).
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My first thought was that it seemed interesting and seemed like I could learn a lot from participating in something like this.  It seems important and I want to contribute something to the community.  I read the description and qualifications and spent a couple days thinking it over to make sure that I would have the time to commit to such a venture.  I do, and so here I am.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Oh goodness...I have had to do this so many times between students, staff, colleagues, and even my own children.  I feel like an expert at this point. How I handle those situations is to listen to each side.  I think it is really important to be aware of your body language and certainly your words while you listen.  If you want people to come agreement, you can&#39;t force it.  If people feel like they are being forced into something, they tend to put up their defenses and shut down in terms of listening.  You get nowhere.  I try to keep my own biases out of what I am hearing.  It&#39;s important to take in the information and actually think about it versus trying to form a response while the person is talking.  I think you have to be willing to play the Devil&#39;s Advocate...even just for a moment in your own mind.  For instance if your initial perception is that you think you will disagree with someone, it&#39;s helpful to take a moment and in your head think about ...what if this perspective has validity that I am not seeing?  What else is there?  You have to be willing to change your mind and accept when someone else has a better idea than you do and to do it in a way that keeps the integrity of both parties intact.  On the other hand, if you have an opinion, you need good reason to support it and need to be able to communicate that clearly and tactfully.  Important decisions should not be made in an arbitrary fashion.  Lastly, it is simply a good idea to think before you speak and to speak from both and empathetic view point while conveying strength in your words.  Have integrity.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Probably my most dominant personality trait is logic.  I love logic within math.  I love logic in decision making.  For me, logic is what makes things easy.  Boiling down statistics, information, and data to draw a conclusion that makes sense is very satisfying for me.  Accepting the gray area and doing a risk analysis to get the best decision in a hard space is something I take pride in.  I have found that I need to temper my desire to be purely logical with a certain amount of emotion when in the real world because many people speak from the heart over the head.  And while I do think emotion has its place, there is something very gratifying about problem solving that relies on pure logic.  As far as analysis, I tend to be the person others contact when they need to know something.  My friends and family know that if it&#39;s something I have researched, I have researched it thoroughly and checked all my sources.  I am very good with numbers, critical thinking, organizing information, and working towards a bottom line and getting there.
