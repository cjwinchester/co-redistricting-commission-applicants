        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Barbara Jonte Conroy</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Barbara Jonte Conroy
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Barbara J. Case</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Retired from the position of Assisistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction in the Boulder Valley School District in 2005. Continued working as a consultant for the Colorado Association of School Executives and the Colorado Education Coalition. Please see attached resume.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Please see attached resume. In both my Bachelors and Master&#39;s programs of studies I have extensive course work in history and political science.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80439-4318
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have worked on GOTV campaigns on behalf of the county and state Democratic Party candidates for several years. This has included phone bank work, canvassing door to door, and this year, texting through ThruText. Many years ago I was a delegate to our County, District, and State Democratic Party Conventions. I have never held any paid position or been compensated for any of my activities. It has all been volunteer work. I have regularly contributed to Colorado Democratic Party, Democratic National Committee, MoveOn.org, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Campaigns of Hillary Clinton, Jared Polis, Elizabeth Warren, Randy Wheelock, Joe Biden, Amy McGrath, and various other small contributions to state level candidates. I would be happy to submit a copy of my ActBlue contribution history; however, it will not convert to a PDF file.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I was appointed by then Governor Roy Romer to the Colorado Standards and Assessment Development and Implementation Council. Prior to 2013, I was a member of American Association of School Administrators, Colorado Association of School Executives, Phi Delta Kappa, and Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development. I have served as a volunteer for Evergreen Christian Outreach which is our community service organization. I have also coordinated the holiday charitable project for a woman&#39;s group I belong to as part of the Evergreen Neighbors and Newcomers association. I am also a member of EMERGE, the East Mount Evans Resource, Growth, and Environment which is our local community association. I currently serve as a member of the board of Seguro y Sano/Safe and Sound, an organization of Mexican citizens and ex-pat&#39;s, who are committed to raising funds for a women&#39;s shelter in San Carlos/Guaymas, Sonora, Mexico.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have extensive experience in these areas. As a member of the Standards and Assessment Development and Implementation Council, I was directly involved in the development of the first Colorado State Model Content Standards which involved extensive outreach to various constituent groups through public hearings and input sessions. These were conducted around the state so I am familiar with the variety of interests and opinions held by different areas. I also was hired by the Colorado Association of School Boards to help their constituents understand what standards were and why they were important. Again, I did this throughout the state. As the head of the divisions charged with developing and overseeing instructional programs in two metro area school districts, I was responsible for presenting programs to the various stakeholder groups and receiving their input. As a training consultant for Colorado Association of School Executives, I advocated for the state law on teacher evaluation and trained administrators on how to implement it effectively. Please see resume for additional details.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe the work of this commission is critical to assuring that our representatives in government truly represent us in a manner consistent with the &quot;one-man/one-vote&quot; principle. Otherwise, our elections are unnecessarily exercises in political machinations rather than attempts to identify the will of the people. When the partisan distribution of the election of representatives is dramatically different from the partisan distribution of the actual votes, that is a sign that districting is unrepresentative. Given that the Supreme Court designated this as clearly a state-level decision, I would very much like to be part of that decision-making at our state level as I believe I have skills and knowledge and understanding of the issues to be a valuable member. I was late in coming to this decision as I was distracted by the recent election. Then, a friend made me deal with my responsibility to at least apply, given many past discussions about this issue. As a result, I have no letters of recommendation but would be happy to obtain them if I am selected through the random selection process to be in the pool of candidates.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have spent most of my adult life in positions that required me to build consensus and create agreement among colleagues, subordinates, and constituents. My service as a member of the Colorado Standards and Assessment Development and Implementation Council required doing this on a regular basis as did the various leadership positions I held throughout my career. One of my strongest skills in this area is the ability to listen carefully, accurately summarize various positions of group members, identify areas of agreement and disagreement, and suggest strategies to resolve those differences. I have learned how not to impose my biases on those interactions while also knowing how to be clear when I am advocating rather than facilitating. I know that there are many ways to achieve a goal. I find that often what appears to be argument about how we should achieve our group goal is actually a lack of agreement regarding that goal. I have demonstrated the ability to identify this difference and help a group step back and reclarify its purpose. Being fair and impartial about how we achieve an agreed upon goal is much easier once the goal is agreed upon. I have worked hard to cultivate the habits identified by Stephen Covey, especially &quot;seek first to understand&quot; and &quot;begin with the end in mind&quot;. I am applying for this appointment because I am strongly committed to the goal of the commission to redistrict in a manner that is fair and consistent with the principle of &quot;one-man/one-vote&quot;. I don&#39;t think you are looking for people who are un-biased or impartial on the importance of that goal. But as I mentioned above, I have the group participation skills needed to be impartial and unbiased in discussing how we achieve this goal.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I know that advanced degrees are not a criterion for selection to serve on this commission. However, the analytical and problem-solving skills I have acquired through these advanced studies, combined with my experience, make me well equipped to join in solving the problems associated with this commission&#39;s mission. I know how to break problems down so that they can be seen more clearly; I have knowledge frameworks that give me tools to apply logic and reason; and, I can help other members of the group see the logic of each other&#39;s arguments.
