<p>
To make sure that all the lands are open and certain issues are related to the areas that effect their lively hood.  Not everyone has to vote on all the issue ,like the wolfs.  re introduce the wolfs to Denver not the hunting, or ranch lands, make sure every vote can count and that one party doesn&#39;t have a monopoly of power.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Mainly keeping in mind the people and their demographics.  What effects some people can&#39;t be voted by the whole state.  I have lived in Colorado where certain interest groups move in and take over not considering the people who have lived there for generations.  I would like to preserve the history of our state and work to improve relationships with people

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I&#39;m a hometown women, growing up in middle class family with great parents that let me make my own decisions to a point,  I had to reason with them to get what I wanted.  I Went to Beauty School at age 13, had my own business at 17.  AS a business owner and employer at a very young age taught me a lot about relationships.  AS a hairdresser I had to become a  very good listener, and good a what I did.   Patience is a virtue but acquired one too.  I also taught adaptive skiing which not only do you need to know how to teach skiing but side effects of the disabilities, medications.  I was taught to teach to the person first, and then the disabilities.   The most important thing is to look at the person first and second is whatever it is they are dealing withand find a way to accomplish your goal.  It is a process of elimination
