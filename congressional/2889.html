        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Samuel W Satterthwaite</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Samuel W Satterthwaite
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Retired
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Bachelor of Science, Aerospace Engineering
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80112
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I attended my local Republican Caucus meeting in 2016.  I was selected as a delegate to the Republican State Convention in 2016.  I volunteered to the Arapahoe County Elections as a Ballot Opener for the 2020 election.  I have not donated to any political organization since Nov 10, 2015.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have been a volunteer member of my local, City of Centennial, Homeowners Association (Trophy Club HOA) since 1987.  I been a member of the TCHOA since 2015 and have been voted as the Vice President of that HOA since 2014.  I have also served as a volunteer member of the TCHOA Covenant development committee since 2016.  I have been an active member of the Southside Bible Church and a volunteer for many events within that body.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have experience within the Aerospace Engineering community participating in many design committees, conferences and projects where differing design solutions were considered and in which I was instrumental in developing the final design solution.  This experience includes more than 35 years in system design, fabrication, testing, and operation as well as and managing various project groups.  
I recently brought this experience to my local HOA and provided a solution to the development of the Declarations of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions that are agreeable to the diverse community involved.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to bring my experience in coordinating various approaches and often opposing views to the Redistricting Commission.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My capability to invite considerations from all members of the commission prior to any evaluation process allows for the group to develop congenial working relationships necessary to the further evaluation of solutions.  This process generally is initiated with the definition of clear requirements and a consensus of the scope/goals and purpose of the activity.  I expect that the task of the redistricting commission will involve complex issues of integrating the 2020 census results with the existing district boundaries.  This will highlight the development of establishing clear requirements and the need for an open working relationship among the commission members where no member is to be considered more valued than another.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My experience as an engineer and a manager provides the capability to recognize the value of diverse inputs while maintaining focus for a solution to satisfy the requirements.  In this redistricting activity there will be many internal and may be even some external considerations for a resolution.  A method of prioritizing, ranking/evaluating inputs is often desirable but that process should not be preemptive of members inputs.   In a process where mutiple solutions may satisfy the original requirements a &quot;simpler is better&quot; approach may help.  The redistricting will likely involve discussions regarding demographic considerations in addition to geographic boundaries.  Disruption of existing boundaries will also be involved if (likely) the 2020 census indicates the addition of districts.   My professional work is extensive in providing the resolution of multi-dimensional complex challenges.  A key element is maintaining focus of the requirements, facts, and restrictions.
