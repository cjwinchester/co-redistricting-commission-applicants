<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a Colorado native, my years involved with organization, representation, and advocacy for this state date back to high school. In the past, I had a keen interest in elevating Colorado&#39;s international presence. I enjoyed serving as Vice-President of the CU Distinguished Speakers Board at CU Boulder and later working as a DU Law student at an international court in The Hague, Netherlands. Throughout these early years, I also assisted with numerous collaborative events with World Denver and the International Law Society.
 
More recently, I&#39;ve focused my efforts on equity, outreach, and Access to Justice for Coloradans seeking services within our court system. I am equally passionate about serving on local non-profit boards, such as Lighthouse Writer&#39;s Workshop and the Art Students League of Denver, to support the arts.
 
Since obtaining my license in 2014, I remain very active within the Colorado and Denver Bar Associations, where I frequently collaborate with a large and diverse array of colleagues from every corner of this state. The Colorado Bar Association recognizes, as do I, the importance of districts outside of the Denver-metro area. I represent the Denver Bar Association on the Colorado Bar Ass&#39;n Board of Governors, with the primary role of forging better alliances and relationships with governors from other counties. My law practice also provides low-cost services to many counties outside of Denver, including Larimer, Douglas, and El Paso. In the past, I have assisted with pro bono family law cases in Weld, Ouray, Eagle, and Summit counties through Bar-affiliated non-profit groups.
 
I currently co-chair a Supreme Court Committee group with the ret. Hon. Angie Arkin, geared at expanding Access to Justice initiatives for Coloradans in the family law courts through limited licensure of paraprofessionals. Access to justice remains a priority for me in my practice.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am a Colorado native - born and raised in Aurora, Colorado. I&#39;ve lived in a few counties since then: Arapahoe, Denver, Jefferson, Boulder. I think it&#39;s important that the Commission represent the full breadth and diversity of its districts. I also take this position very seriously as it will shape the future of Colorado&#39;s voter representation for the next decade. My service on the Commission would allow me to better the State I&#39;ve loved since childhood. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a family lawyer, I spend my days at the center of very intimate and personal conflict. I also have a certification in mediation and mediate family law cases for non-profit organizations. There are always two sides - two perspectives (or even more) to every issue. It is important to recognize each commissioner&#39;s value and input. This takes active listening, which I apply to my everyday practice. It also takes a sense of humility and fairness that each individual has the State&#39;s best interests in mind and has something to offer regardless of political affiliation. I think with my professional and personal experiences. I can be fair and impartial. I look forward to having constructive conversations with my fellow Commissioners and to learn from them. If necessary, I can also serve as a mediator to address any conflict or disagreement beyond regular discussion. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I practice law, which requires analytical reasoning on a day-to-day basis. At the trial level, this also requires me to see through emotions that clients, judges, and Opposing Counsel may have at the center of a lawsuit or disagreement. At the appellate level, I&#39;m challenged by a panel of three judges as to the reasoning of my arguments and their soundness in law. I believe these skills, along with my numerous positions with committees and non-profit Boards, would be a helpful asset to the Commission.
