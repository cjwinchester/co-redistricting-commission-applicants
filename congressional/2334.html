   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Emily Ann Reaser
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Emily A Reaser</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Currently I am a self-employed yoga teacher and recent Masters Level graduated from the School of Social Work at University of Denver. I currently volunteer with several local nonprofits teaching yoga, counseling and providing strategic fundraising support as I seek full-time employment to get my licensure. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a Masters in Social Work from University of Denver. I have a Bachelor of Arts from University of Michigan. I am a certified 200 hour yoga teacher. I frequently take trainings on yoga and humanistic psychology and most recently completed a training on Yoga and the Vagus Nerve from Embodied Yoga. I am a certified QPR (Question, Persuade, Refer) Suicide Prevention Trainer. I am also Leave No Trace certified through the National Outdoor Leadership School. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80218
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Yes, I have volunteered for the Democratic Party most recently for the 2020 Joe Biden election.  I did phone banking.  I have donated to the following campaigns: Democratic National Party, Joe Biden, Jaime Harrison, Amy McGrath, Mark Kelley, Beto O&#39;Rourke, and Hillary Clinton.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
National Association of Social Workers
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have a decade long history as a non-profit fundraising professional. In this capacity, my job was raise money for organizations like the CU Helen and Arthur E. Johnson Depression Center, Denver Art Museum, Challenge Denver and Denver Film Society. In these roles, my job was to represent the organization and help individuals and organizations understand how their donation could help our organization achieve our mission.  It is my belief that an organization is made up of people and in representing an organization I am representing not just the mission statement but also the many individuals who work for, with or benefit from the organization.  

Even prior to my work as a fundraiser I have a long history of representing organizations.  I attended Catholic school as a child and adolescent.  Service to our community was a tenent of our schooling.  I was taught that my behavior/actions reflected on the school as well as on me. This helped me develop skills to support others beyond myself through my behaviors, actions and words.   It also taught me about my responsibility to others.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have a strong value around civic duty. It is an honor and a responsibility to help create the world I want to live in. I worked at many nonprofits where I played a role in helping to shape our community.  I always took this responsibility seriously and part of my hope in getting my Masters in Social Work was to understand how to be a better citizen, colleague, leader and friend.  In social work school I learned more about how many members of society are left behind or punished by public policy they did not create.  We have a very diverse state with residents in rural, urban and suburban communities. We have Latin American and African immigrants, folks who identify as members of Turtle Island (Native American), white folks, Black folks and many Latinx individuals (this is not an exhaustive list but starting place).  It would be an honor to represent these diverse constituents by creating voting maps that reflects them.   Given that I am not a politician nor do I represent one, I believe I could be a impartial participant who is thinking about the best interests of individuals and communities,  promoting our democracy and putting an end to gerrymandering.  I am passionate about creating a more fair and just society which this commission will play a significant role in.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Listening to one another is a crucial first step to developing consensus.  Being curious about why someone thinks the way they do is part of why I went back to social work graduate school. There I honed my active listening skills which helps me clarify and understand the other better.  I believe in this role, I will not know everything, no one will and the job of the commision is to each use our talents to create a more fair and just redistricting plan for our state.  That means, there are no personal winners or losers but rather the duty to do what is right for our greater community.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In graduate school I honed my skills -reading to comprehend, listening to understand, asking questions to clarify - to better understand systemic issues that affect individuals.  Prior to graduate school I personally studied systems thinking.  In systems thinking outcomes are seeen to relate to many variables made up of actions, reactions and interactions.  With this approach to problem solving one can see that there are many ways to get to any end goal.  Overall, I enjoy systemic problem solving where I can incorporate logic and reason.
