        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Caroline Elizabeth Cornell</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Caroline Elizabeth Cornell
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Caroline Elizabeth Davis</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  For most of the past decade I have built a small business providing professional services as a recruiter, career coach and resume writer.  Prior to that time, I was an at home parent raising our two children.  Since 2001 I have volunteered to serve the community through youth based organizations, frequently serving in leadership roles.  My work has centered around service statewide through Girl Scouts of Colorado and closer to home, the Cherry Creek School District.  
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have degrees in History and Political Science including a minor in geography from the University of Tampa in Florida.  I also hold a Masters’ Degree in History from University College London.  
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80016
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I served as a Republican Precinct Leader from 2016 – 2020.  During the 2020 cycle, I was a candidate for the Colorado Legislature for House District 37.  My contributions and activities have strictly been at the state and local level.  Contributions include the Colorado Republican Committee, Arapahoe County Republicans, and the following Campaigns:  Citizens for Cherry Creek Schools, Caroline Cornell, Suzanne Staiert, and John Kellner.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Since September 2015, I have served on the Board of Directors of Girl Scouts of Colorado, serving as the Chairperson of Membership for the past 5 years.  In September 2019, I became the Board Chair Elect, interim.  My responsibilities to Girl Scouts also include serving two terms as a National Council Delegate representing 30,000 Colorado Girl Scouts at the 2017 and 2020 national conventions.  The National Council Session, held every three years, provides democratic governance for the national organization, which is Congressionally chartered non-profit.  The experience of participating in an event that was transitioned from an in person event attended by 15,000 people to a virtual one due to the pandemic, is directly relevant to the Commission process.  Throughout my governance volunteer time with Girl Scouts, I have continued directly serving girls by maintaining my roles service unit manager, a localized volunteer management position which ended in June 2020, and troop leader.  To be successful, I have learned to balance the division between operational and governance volunteer hats which requires an ability to acknowledge the overlapping authorities in play in a way that prevents any conflict of interest.  
My service to Cherry Creek Schools includes serving as Parent Teacher Organization President for a total of six years at Peakview Elementary and Falcon Creek Middle School.  I also volunteered to lead fundraising activities at Grandview High School.  In addition, I also served on the governing board for all district parent teacher organizations, Parents’ Council, for six years in communication and compliance roles.  
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Through my various volunteer roles, I have gained extensive experience organizing activities; advocating on behalf of an organization, underrepresented community, constituent group; and learned how to make the difficult calls often required in leadership roles.  
I have organized community wide events with thousands of participants involving hundreds of volunteers.  I have worked to ensure that girls who don’t have a voice in the process have their opinions heard by going out and listening to those perspectives and taking them back to decision makers.  I have helped create new and innovative programming based on that feedback.  And most of all I have learned about the value of consensus decision making as a leadership style.  With consensus decision making everyone reaches a point where they can accept the decision even though they are not thrilled with it:  all parties are heard, winners and losers are minimized and the outcome is one that works for the benefit of the community rather than the individual.  
I have also developed extensive experience working with non-profit bylaws.  Early on, I learned the value of establishing a checks and balances system as a means to ensure governance works for the benefit of an organization.  I took those lessons to heart and have leveraged them as a backdrop to nearly every activity I have ever worked on.  This foundational background has helped me be able to share my expertise with the organizations I volunteer with as well as act as a resource to others in my personal network to help the organizations they volunteer with.
In my current role with Girl Scouts, I am charged ensuring the efficacy of the program remains aligned to membership, both girls and adult volunteers, across the state of Colorado.  And that the voice of membership is carried through to decision making.  To say that Colorado is diverse minimizes the broad range of divergent needs we have in our state.  Yes, the fundamentals remain the same regardless of geography, but how they interact within a community is unique in so many ways across Colorado.  Through this experience I have learned not only to balance this uniqueness, but embrace it.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
This will be the first time Colorado has drawn non-politically based boundaries.  The commission will need to establish new processes, create criteria that works in Coloradans best interests and ultimately reach a consensus.  The commission itself needs to be filled with people who are not only well-intentioned, but able to focus on the purpose of the commission before other interests.  The members will need to have solid analytical and consensus building abilities as well as a diverse skill set to ensure all aspects of this project are successfully completed.  Balancing these diverse and complex needs is something all commissioners will need to bring to the team.  I have a wealth of relevant experience that can be leveraged to ensure the commission’s work is successful.
Coloradans are smart. As a people, they are more aware of political divisiveness than ever before.  We saw this illustrated during this year’s election with the public’s distrust in the political process and the general sense of helplessness expressed by so many in so many different ways.  The Independent Redistricting Commission provides an attempt to restore faith in the process by establishing fair and equitable procedures for redistricting, using an open, transparent, and inclusive process.  When the voters passed Amendments Y and Z in 2018, the goal was to create an example of how people can push aside their political differences, roll up their sleeves and work together to restore the people’s faith in democracy.  Commission members will need to work in a professional manner that benefits the people of Colorado.  Voters need to know that their votes matter, otherwise they won’t bother to vote.  Simply stated, this is something I want to be a part of - restoring confidence in the process so we maintain our current high levels of civic engagement and continue to build on them.
I keenly believe that this important work would benefit from the unique skills and abilities I have developed through my diverse professional and volunteer experiences.  Creating a Commission made up of members who value that the interests of all should be included in the electoral process and that the end goal needs to bolster the public confidence throughout the process.  

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
At my core, I am honest, trustworthy, fair and balanced.  I am known for calling it exactly how I see it and being clear in my thought processes.  As a leader, I often encourage diverse opinions to bubble up simply because debate often enhances the outcome when working in teams.  If everyone is in agreement before the conversation even starts, then we&#39;re just checking the box.  For me, a team always does its best work when people who agree on the why respectfully ask good questions of each other to make sure the how IS the best possible outcome.  I believe we do our best work and have the best outcomes when two people who have opposite opinions on what to do reach a consensus at the end – that a bit of grit in the grease helps us all reach the best solution that is systems oriented and drives long term results.
Some of the work I am most professionally proud of involves a Girl Scout bully prevention program I both taught and trained others on for a number of years. Extrapolating that the messaging in that experience to committee work, I learned that if one person attempts to dominate the conversation, as often happens with committee work, it’s up to the rest of the members to push back and balance out the conversation.  This is a fundamental part of ensuring the Commission reaches the best outcome for Colorado.  Members must strive to reach that point where no one person is happy, but everyone can live with the outcome – consensus – for the Commission to be successful.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
If there is one thing I excel at it is problem solving.  Digging into the details to understand all sides of an issue, considering all the relevant criteria, and then creating a framework for decision making.  Finally, applying this information to the decision making process to reach an outcome.  When you add a continuous improvement mindset and the discipline needed to stay the course by adhering to a defined process, you have a fairly solid representation of my personal analytical processes.  
This process driven analytical approach, the definition of using analysis to reach a decision, is ultimately what is needed for the Commission to do its important work.  Having a member with my exact skill set on the Commission, particularly in the first cycle, will help facilitate a data driven approach to ensuring boundaries are drawn that make sense to the communities within those boundaries.
