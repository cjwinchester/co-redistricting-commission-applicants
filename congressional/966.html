<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
The mission of the LGBTQ Commission is to serve as a liaison from the LGBTQ community to the Mayor of Denver on issues important to our community. 

I also began my career as an advocate for homeless youth and youth aging out of foster care, a role I have been able to continue as a commissioner. 

Less formally, I have volunteered on several projects to provide insight on how the Jewish community can be a more inclusive space for LGBTQ members and people of color, both at the local JCC and at my children’s preschool housed at Temple Sinai. 

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Having spent the last several years working for philanthropic organizations who are committed to investing in creating and maintaining a fair and inclusive democracy, it has become clear to me that good government is one that is responsive to the communities and it is the duty of everyday citizens to be involved in making sure that happens. 

One of the best ways I have seen this work is by reforming the tools that have allowed parties to rig the rules in their favor. Gerrymandering has created maps where too much power has been tilted toward the parties in charge and away from the voters and is a great example of how some can take processes that are technically legal, but fundamentally unfair, and cement power for generations. The people are not served well by closed processes that exacerbate divisiveness. Having fairly drawn maps is central to ending extremism and gridlock and will ensure that people have a fair say in represents them. Colorado has some of the best democratic processes in the country and reforming the processes for redistricting will be a huge piece of creating a better functioning and reflective government.  

On a more personal note, I have been proud to call Colorado home for almost 10 years, even though it did not seem like the most obvious fit at the time for a Black biracial Jewish queer woman who had just had my marriage legally recognized back on the East Coast where I am from. Yet my wife and I have been able to raise a family and create a home here for our twins. As a parent, I feel it is my responsibility help build the kind of society I want to leave behind for my children. I also want to model this responsibility to give back the way my mother and my mentors modeled it for me through their work, activism, and civic engagement. As a person from a very diverse background, I was very lucky to have people in my life who taught me the importance of representation and how real change can happen when someone like you is in a position to shape the systems that impact your life. Our communities deserve to have representation that reflects their experiences, identities, and values. 

I believe it is our duty as citizens to be informed and to be involved to the best of our ability. I appreciate all the previous efforts made to get Colorado a fair redistricting process and now the onus is on us to make sure that process is successful, and I would be honored to be part of that work. 

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As chair of the LGBTQ Commission, I was tasked with leading a very diverse group toward joint goals meant to better the lives of all Denverites. Much of that work was bringing together very disparate views of and visions for the world. My role was to make sure all views were heard and respected and to allow each commissioner to teach and also learn from one another. Ultimately, when people were able to share their view, we were able to focus on our big shared values and come together for the good of the city.  So much of our perceived divisiveness often came from a lack of understanding. By keeping our work centered in the commonalities that brought us together led to significant changes that improved the lives of countless LGBTQ residents.

Finding consensus is also a key feature of my work leading a donor collaborative.  I bring together teams of grantees in the states and a group of foundation partners. All of these people and organizations come to the table with very different priorities, theories of change, and issue silos.  My work is to help facilitate the joining of these ideals and create a strategic plan that works for all. While some might feel the work of “serving too many masters” is counterproductive, my experience has taught me that, when done well, it can lead to exponentially stronger outcomes.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a grantmaker, logic and reason are some of the most useful tools in my toolbox. When making large financial decisions with a limited pool of resource, my “gut” has to be backed up by data in order to make a compelling argument to funders that my recommendation is the best use of their funds. I then have to be able to take that data back to grantee partners and develop plans to move our work forward together. Being trusted to play this role is a privilege, one I take very seriously, and one I have earned by being an honest broker and making the best decisions I am able to with the information available to me.
