<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a long time public educator, I have worked on many committees, held many offices and constantly pursued excellence as an educator and the many professional organizations. During my full-time professional years, I planned and coordinated trainings and conferences for teachers across the state.  I also worked on district and state committees to update curriculums. I worked with the Colorado Community College System, other states and private foundations to facilitate funding and activities for educational workshops. In addition, I worked as a team teacher both at the high school and college level.  Team teaching takes a great deal of communication and time in order to produce a quality educational experience for students as well as a positive collegial working relationship.
 
In 2015 my husband stepped up to run for the Board of Education in Jefferson County.  I worked actively with his campaign, as well as the campaigns of the other BOE candidates.  I listened to constituents, organized outreach efforts, helped track campaign donations and a variety of other tasks as needed. He served as board president and I have supported, advised and attended many school districts functions and activities.
 
In 2017 I joined the work of the Community Grief Center of Greeley to help the Family Trek Program.  As a facilitator I was trained to conduct eight sessions with different age groups to assist families with the loss of a loved one.  The services were free to families and I volunteered my time to train and work with the teen groups.  In recent years I have volunteered through our Homeowners Association to welcome new neighbors and assist in planning and conducting social/get-acquainted activities.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am a Colorado native and very proud of our beautiful state. As a longtime unaffiliated voter in a state with a growing number of independent voters I am very interested in seeing equity in representation of Coloradoans across the state.  I recognize that balancing numbers and equity issues is important in electing public officials that will represent their constituents not just a political ideology.  I am interested in this committee and at a time in my life where I can devote the time and energy to the process which hopefully results in fair and balanced districts across the state.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
1) It is important to do your homework, read and study the data provided, consider the various geographic areas and needs across the state. 2) Listening is a key skill to working effectively within a committee.  Ask questions, listen and respect opinions. 3) Points or arguments should be made based on facts and legitimate needs not a political platform. 4) In the last four years, I have leaned more to one party than the other.  However, that has not been true throughout my life. I have supported candidates from both parties and causes that lean both conservative and liberal. I do not have a need to gerrymander a district to represent a particular party, but would rather see a balance as much as distance and populations of the area will allow.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Over my career and life experience I have served on many problem solving and decision-making committees. The ultimate goal has always been to arrive at an outcome based on consensus that is acceptable to all members. I understand and value data and statistics.  I welcome discussion and reasoning to arrive at decisions, and have excellent listening skills.
