        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for William J. Leone</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  William J. Leone
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Partner, Norton Rose Fulbright US LLP; Attorney
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  BS Political Science: 1978, Colorado State University
JD University of Colorado, 1981
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80023
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
None since 2015.  I have served on the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission for the past 7 years having been appointed once by the Governor and once by the Colorado Senate and have refrained from political donations or activity for that time.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Colorado Independent Ethics Commission
Chief Justices Commission on the Profession
Ad Hoc Committee for seeking increases to the federal judiciary in Colorado
See Resume attached
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a practicing attorney and litigator, I have represented a wide variety of interests.  These include large and small corporations, family owned businesses, individuals, plaintiffs and defendants.

In addition I served as the United States Attorney for Colorado from December 2004 to October 2006. During that time I prosecuted individuals and corporations for white collar crime, firearms violations, drug offenses, and healthcare fraud.  I also represented the federal government in environmental and civil matters affecting federal lands and agencies.

During my federal service and during my time on the IEC I have refrained from political activity.  However, in between these periods of service, and going back many years, I did serve as a precinct committee person in Adams County and have donated to campaigns of both Republicans and Democrats including Bill Ritter, John Hickenlooper, John Suthers, and John McCain.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that good government starts with fairly drawn, effective districts that promote competitive and representative districts. I was born in Trinidad, grew up in Colorado Springs, went to college and law school in Fort Collins and Boulder and worked in Denver for the better part of 35 years. I have served in a high level government position and have experience administering and enforcing the laws in a bi-partisan way without fear or favor for either side.  I think I can bring this experience to either re-districting commission.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
One of my strengths is getting competing sides to agree on the facts and narrow and focus their disagreements.  Among other credentials, I received training and served as a mediator for the American Arbitration Association. I have presided over mediations and participated in mediations in a large percentage of my cases.  In all those cases, most of which settle, the search for creative settlements that help both sides achieve their objectives is a central part of what I do. Usually, that narrowing and focus lays the foundation for a reasonable compromise that may not achieve either sides complete agenda, but produces a result that everyone can acknowledge is fair and gives both sides an opportunity to compete fairly. Creating an even playing field is central to my life and career as a private lawyer, prosecutor, and defense lawyer. As noted, I have donated to both sides, advocated for both sides, and ruled for and against both sides in making decisions on the IEC.  Although, I would never pretend to be perfect or always get it right, I donâ€™t think anyone can question my objectivity. In 2003 and 2004 my name was submitted to the White House for a position on the federal bench and I was interviewed. Although a finalist, I was not selected.  However, I remain interested in trying to give back to the community. I see these commissions as a way to do that. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a practicing attorney I have dealt with cases involving some of the most complex issues in our courts, including Anti-trust, civil and criminal securities cases, environmental, intellectual property, complex contract, regulatory and bribery and corruption. In addition, at various times in my career I have dealt with much more main street legal issues including personal injury, landlord tenant disputes, debtor-creditor law and personal issues faced by families with troubled children or personal legal problems. I have enjoyed all these matters, large and small, and believe that experience helps me understand the concerns of many of our citizens and what they are looking for in an electoral map.
