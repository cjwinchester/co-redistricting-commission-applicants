        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Tila Duhaime</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Tila Duhaime
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Tila Estrada</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am not currently employed outside the home. I do occasional legal work as a solo practitioner in intellectual property for a handful of clients. I also currently serve on the Transportation Advisory Board for the City of Boulder, an appointed position I have held for three and a half years. I have been the chairperson for that Board since April 2020. Prior to moving to Colorado in 2012 I worked as a community organizer for Transportation Alternatives in New York City.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I received a BA from the University of California, Berkeley in 1996 and a JD from Columbia University in 2000. I am a member in good standing of the bar of the state of Colorado.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80302
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been moderately politically active my entire adult life, predominantly working for particular candidates in local and national elections rather than for particular issues or any political party at large. I have traveled to other states to engage voters in swing states and observe polls, observed polls and knocked on doors in my own city, and engaged in phonebanking, postcard writing, and other direct voter-to-voter outreach efforts over the years. I typically donate my time rather than money to such efforts, but I am a regular donor to CoPIRG which does legislative advocacy in Colorado. I may have donated to NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado in the time period specified, but do not recall for certain. I donated to Phil Weiser&#39;s campaign for CO Attorney General in 2018, and to Diane Mitsch Bush&#39;s campaign in 2018 and possibly 2020. I have made donations to Western Resource Advocates and the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network (RMIAN) in at least 2018.   
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am a member of the Colorado Bar. I am a lifetime member of Transportation Alternatives, in New York City. I am also a member of Community Cycles and its Advocacy Committee in Boulder CO. Since April 2017 I have been an appointed member of Boulder&#39;s Transportation Advisory Board, and since April of this year have served as the chairperson of the Board, including conducting public hearings from time to time in the course of the business of that Board. I have done extensive volunteer work for the PTA of my local public school, but in light of COVID such opportunities are quite limited these days.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Most of my advocacy efforts and interests involve people who do not typically have strong, organized groups or associations working on their behalf, and who often lack a voice or representation in our government.
I have worked in Colorado to advance the visibility and protection of vulnerable road users; typically, pedestrians and cyclists who are disproportionately injured on our transportation network. Advocates for this work in the past few decades have illustrated the interconnections between transportation policy, land use decisions, infrastructure priorities, legal framework, public communication strategies, and engineering decisions that are fundamental governmental functions at every level. I have engaged with local nonprofits, state lawmakers, district attorneys and other law enforcement officers, members of the general public and elected officials at various levels of government to help advance lifesaving changes on our road networks. 
I have also been trained by RMIAN to represent minor immigrants facing deportation proceedings in Colorado to advance their cases through the immigration court process, although I have not to date been assigned a client. 
While helping a family member get back on his feet after being released from prison, my eyes were opened to the multiple, lifelong obstacles former felons face in establishing themselves in a community, accessing community resources, finding and keeping employment, or engaging with their government. 
As a parent of a child with a developmental disability, I have also learned quite a lot in recent years about special-needs populations in our public school system, the legal protections for them, and ways in which those systems still fail to adequately serve them. I have engaged in small advocacy efforts on behalf of my child and families like ours who have additional challenges accessing education and being able to participate in the community at large.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have seen first hand the powerlessness of people who are already in legal trouble, whether it is people facing criminal charges or those who have served time and are trying to re-enter the community, and believe they deserve due process and protection of our legal system. Our society treats them as unsympathetic figures, but they are real people with real struggles who cannot assert themselves without help. Many people cannot vote but still have rights in our system: the very young, people seeking asylum, former felons, non-native English speakers, people who cannot read English, and more. I want to ensure our government takes them into account. I believe that every citizen deserves to have her interests considered and included in our representative government.   
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
A successful attorney must be able to understand the conflict from perspective of the opposing side, and this is key to finding any mutually satisfying solution. In my role as an appointed city official, both in Boulder and previously in New York City, I have often had to forge a consensus opinion or recommendation where there was no clear majority viewpoint at the beginning of discussion. I am able to frame a problem or question from a broad enough perspective to have universal agreement (for example: no one should die in car crashes on our roads); starting from a common place means that any disagreements involve how to fix the problem, rather than whether we should be working on it in the first place. Being able to articulate others&#39; discomfort with a proposal, in a way they agree is fair, is essential to overcoming it. I&#39;ve had lots of practice in all of these situations.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
One of the more gratifying experiences from my recent work on the Transportation Advisory Board was working with city staff to develop a decision matrix to prioritize projects among multiple applications for street enhancements in light of limited city resources to fund, design, and install them. How do we weigh the need and merit of similar street treatments on different sections of the city, with different public amenities, different populations of users, different risk factors? I am proud of the result of our work, even though we found the need to revise it within two years to better reflect our community priorities and to provide better equity for poorer areas. It left future applicants with a better idea of what was a qualifying set of circumstances, and gave the prioritization process a sense of fair, transparent objectivity that will be important for years to come.
