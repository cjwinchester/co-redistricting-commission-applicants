<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
See Below 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Before I became a mother of three boys (as well as a teacher), I was quite active in civic life.    I am looking to return to civic and community life in this next season of my career.  Prior to 2015, I served on the youth outreach community of the Wilshire Community Police Advisory Board, as well as volunteered at PATH (People Assisting the Homeless).  My husband and I led a college and career group at our church.  I was a charter member of a rowing team on the campus of Occidental College, and I interned with Los Angeles City Councilmember Laura Chick, as well as participated in a Summer Internship program at Georgetown University in Washington D.C.  
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
A huge part of my civic involvement came through my time at the Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley.  As a writer and special projects assistant. I saw the intricacies of business, its many challenges and far reaching interdependence in all the facets of our lives from education to health care to groundwater pollution issues.  My time there took me all over Southern California and beyond as I participated in ground water and college campus symposiums throughout the west, hospital roundtables, economic forecasting and small business, etc.   

After my husband and I relocated our small business to Colorado, I became a history, social studies and language teacher in Douglas County.  In this role, I have promoted historical learning. creating fieldtrips where there was previously not that structure. These include a day of history at the Colorado Highlands Ranch Mansion with local historical dancing, the Cherokee Ranch and Castle, where students not only learned about the architecture and art, but witnessed veterinarian care of the Ranches cattle herd and lastly, an ecclesiastical tour of the downtown Catholic Basilica as well as the Greek Orthodox Church illustrating the lasting effects of the East-West Church Schism.  

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Again, as a mother of three boys, and as a part-time teacher, as well as a family owner of a small business, I have had my hands full.  However, as my boys have gotten a little older and with more of these opportunities becoming online, I have been very excited to get back involved with civic life.  I was very active with civic organizations it is time to get involved again.   And redistricting by citizens, not political parties, is incredibly important!  Something that can make a real difference! 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have registered as unaffiliated with the express purpose of reminding myself not to vote exclusively down party lines.  In the past, I have made an effort to look at each issue and candidate, regardless of party affiliation.  And my actions can testify to that.  In the past, I have worked for City Council Laura Chick, a democrat, as well as briefly for former President Reagan, a Republican.

As a teacher, I have to be fair and impartial with my students regardless of my personal feelings toward a student.  I have often found that when there is a point of contention, I need to seek to understand, to wait and listen. Often, I am rewarded with an increased awareness of the student&#39;s needs and their reason for behaving a certain way.  This allows me to tailor my response.  However, the goal of equipping these students with what they need for their lives remains the same.  Promoting consensus and contributing to create agreement among commissioners would require the same time-honored approach of seeking to understand first, then to be understood.  
   
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
When I was applying to graduate school, I received a score in the 90th percentile of the analytical portion.  I have always been someone who loves to tackle a problem, seek to understand it, analyze it and then often to teach it to another person.  My analytical skills have been one of the greatest assets to me as a teacher.  I am constantly assessing my student&#39;s current grasp of a particular concept, figuring out where the gaps in their knowledge and understanding might be and coming up with the best way to fill in those gaps. 

I am one of the few people who like to do those logic puzzles before bed.  You know the ones with the grid and a list of clues.  Suzie is taller than Jeff but shorter than Bill...
