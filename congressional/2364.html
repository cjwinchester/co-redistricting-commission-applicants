<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am a lifelong Democrat and have served as a party precinct committee person in the distant past (1980s) in Oregon.

My work involved organizing CEA members to be politically active, including working on candidate and ballot issue campaigns from local school board races to local mill and bond elections, state and federal candidate elections, and statewide ballot issues. I led the planning and implementation of programs designed to get members involved in all levels of political campaigning and lobbying elected officials, including the interview and endorsement process, phone banking, canvasing door-to-door, direct mail, volunteer recruitment, campaign media, lobby days at the state Capitol, letter writing campaigns, etc. As a lobbyist/government relations staff person for the Colorado Education Association in 2005-10 I directly lobbied the General Assembly and State Board of Education on legislation and policy concerning public education, employment law and employee rights , school finance and budget, PERA retirement, teacher certification, education reform, etc. In that role I continued to organized CEA members state-wide to be involved at all levels of politics, including campaigning and lobbying activities.

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Most of my adult working life was spent organizing, representing, and advocating for public school employees. First as an elected leader  (president, collective bargaining spokesperson, building representative, grievance committee chair, etc.) of my local education association when I was a high school mathematics teacher, and then as a professional staff person managing local affiliates of the Colorado Education Association. I was responsible for organizing for membership and bipartisan political activity; representing individuals and groups of employees at the building and district levels in all employment matters; and advocating for members at the collective bargaining table and in grievance processes up through binding arbitration and mediation. As a lobbyist for the CEA, I was responsible for organizing member participation in campaigning for and lobbying legislators; representing members by testifying at committee hearings and lobbying individual legislators; and advocating for or considering the interest of members when researching, analyzing, and drafting legislation and policy proposals. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Fundamentally, I believe our democracy is at risk due to the hyper-partisanship that exists today within our political system. One reason this hyper-partisanship continues is that noncompetitive Congressional districts limit the voters&#39; ability to hold our representatives accountable for their actions. This allows representatives to be unwilling to compromise for the good of the country without electoral consequences. While the problem is worse elsewhere in the country, it also exists to a degree in Colorado. I believe one potential solution is to make more Congressional districts competitive so extremists from one party or the other don&#39;t have &quot;free rides&quot; by virtue of their party registration, and can more easily be held accountable to and by voters. Creating more competitive districts is likely not the total solution to this problem, but it is a step in the right direction. I understand there are limits to what can be achieved in attempting to create competitive districts, and that the process may be more art than science. However, I believe my skills working with and leading diverse groups of people and my experience working within the political system can help the commission to draw more competitive districts that ultimately may reduce extreme partisanship in Colorado.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Reaching consensus within any group requires three basic things. Participants must want to reach agreement, must be willing to keep an open mind, and must actively listen to and consider alternative views. I will use my skills developed over many years as a successful professional mediator to encourage and model good listening, open-mindedness, raising alternatives, appropriate communication, and respect for others&#39; views. 

With regard to fairness and impartiality, I have demonstrated my abilities in two distinct arenas. First, as an arbitrator/mediator for nearly nine years I always maintained my reputation for fairness and impartiality. In such a role one serves at the pleasure of the parties who mutually agree to use your services. If either side questions your fairness or suspects any bias you simply don&#39;t get selected to hear cases or mediate disputes. On occasion I&#39;ve had to disclose potential conflicts of interest to parties after I was selected, and at least once chose to recuse myself to avoid the appearance of conflict. Never was my neutrality questioned. In the business of being a professional neutral your credibility, fairness, and impartiality are the &quot;coin of the realm.&quot; Second, I spent 20 years as high school wrestling official, being invited to officiate matches at the highest levels in multiple states. Again, one doesn&#39;t gain that kind of success and recognition if there is any hint of unfairness or partiality in one&#39;s work. 


</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Both my background in mathematics and law have contributed to my ability to solve problems using analytical skills, logic and reason. Mathematics is all based on logic and reason, especially at its higher levels. Mathematical proofs and statistical analysis are but two of many examples.

As an arbitrator, I was tasked with understanding the law, conducting fair hearings, reviewing all kinds of documentary evidence and testimony, judging credibility, considering complex legal arguments, interpreting disputed contract language, and rendering fair, written decisions justified with clearly explained rationale. Success as an arbitrator depends on getting the losing party to understand why they lost. Legal analysis, logic, reason, and clear writing are at the foundation of this kind of work. I was successful for the nearly nine years I did this work because of my ability to use analysis, logic, and reason.
