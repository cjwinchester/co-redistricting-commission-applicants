        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Ross J Wabeke</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Ross J Wabeke
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Lawyer
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Bachelor of Science degree from Grand Valley University . June 1976
Juris Doctorate degree from Gonzaga University
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80537
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not been politically active other than to pay attention to issues and to vote in every election since moving to Colorado in 1979 regardless of the type of election; federal, state or local. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
1. I was very actively involved in the Loveland Swim Club ending in late 2015 when my children had reached the age that they were no longer involved. My involvement lasted for 26 uninterrupted years. I was on the Board of Directors of the organization for 18 years and was President of the Board of Directors for 13 years. A youth sports organization can seem rather ordinary and mundane, but during my tenure the Club grew to over 425 swimmers and was a major swimming powerhouse on the national level. The demands of dealing with many parents and coaches were rather intense but I really believed that the organization was well worth my time.

I have been a member of the Colorado and Larimer County Bar Associations for most of the time of I have practiced law beginning in 1980.

Since approximately August of 2018 I was actively involved in the middle school and high school students group at the church I belong to.

I have been a member of Crossroads Church in Loveland, Colorado since approximately 2005.

There are other boards and organizations that I have been involved with but my involvement ended prior to November 10, 2015. These would include the Loveland Board of Retirement, numerous school accountability committees and school volunteer groups.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My experience in organizing, representing, advocating for or considering the interests of groups in Colorado really goes back to my time with the Loveland Swim Club. Again, I know that a youth sports organization can sound pretty unchallenging and maybe lacking in providing the experience needed but it was like an unpaid full-time job in trying to balance the needs and demands of parents who many times had their own agenda and a coaching staff of 14 or more at one point and in addition, dealing with different municipalities and school districts to secure swimming pool time.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The work of congressional redistricting seems almost invisible to me but very important. 
I want to give back to my state at a time when I have a little more time to do so. 
Although I believe there will probably be many qualified applicants, I believe that after many years of serving the public in private law practice, the experience I have would be useful on this commission.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My personal belief is that decisions made by consensus are always better that decision making based only on what the majority wants. I also believe that to build consensus requires listening to people and their different points of view and different interests and this takes a lot of time. If you rush in making decisions you risk leaving people out of the process and if people are left out they will end up lacking ownership of decisions that are made.
I think we all look at ourselves as being fair and impartial. I did spend 16 years as a Bankruptcy Trustee for the Federal District of Colorado. Bankruptcy Trustees are not judges but they are appointed by the United States Bankruptcy Court to administer bankruptcy cases. I served in that capacity in over 7,500 cases and in almost all of them you had real people who had been financially devastated often times being pursued by people who were owed money legitimately and who felt wronged. It was often time a balancing act in following the law and what I had to do and at the same time be fair to all parties in the process.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have been a practicing attorney in Colorado since June of 1980.  Applying logic and reason has been necessary in almost every case that I have been involved with. However, while applying logic and reason I have always had to deal with the very real human element in legal disputes and that means dealing with emotion.  In my opinion you can have superior analytic skills and you can have incredible logic and reason, but if the human element is left out it will leave people feeling unheard from. Many problems require thorough logic, reasoning and analysis, but if not enough time is spent on the human side, the resolution of then problem will be left wanting.
