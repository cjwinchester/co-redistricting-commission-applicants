<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
For the last 10 years I have been the Program Director for Doing Democracy Day (DDD) in St. Vrain Valley Schools.  DDD is a one day local government event featuring students and local leaders wrestling with local issues like school safety, homelessness, vaping, recycling, etc.   Local government officials and school board members serve as live resources for students who research the issues and offer possible solutions.   Each year the event features more than 80 students and dozens local leaders from multiple communities.   DDD focuses on solutions to local issues, using a non-partisan approach.  (The former Executive Director of the Colorado Municipal League, Sam Mamet is fond of saying, &quot;a pothole doesn&#39;t care if it is fixed by a Republican or Democrat, it just wants to be fixed!)  Here is an article about the event.  https://www.timescall.com/2019/04/30/svvsd-students-learn-about-democracy-from-community-leaders/.  It is attached in extra documents.
Boulder County Latino History Project - Co-Director.  We collected, organized, and published an extensive collection of primary resources devoted to telling the story of Boulder County Latinos.  I was largely responsible for planning and helping to conduct the multi-day teacher workshops for the last 6 years on how to use the materials in K-12 classrooms.  These workshops resulted in more than 100 lessons published online at our website.  The project is now run by a fully funded position at the University of Colorado Boulder.   https://teachbocolatinohistory.colorado.edu/

My service on the Board of Directors for the Colorado Education Association and on the Retired Council requires consideration of view points across the state and across multiple demographic groups.   I have also lobbied and testified on behalf of these organizations and on my own behalf with the state legislature.  
As a member of the Longmont Area Chamber of Commerce Public Policy Committee we are presented with issues affecting local businesses and asked to make recommendations to the Chamber Board of Directors.   Having spent most of my career in the public sector, I have come to more fully appreciate the private sector and in particular the dedication of small businesses to the civic good.   Members of the committee share their experience with public policy and how it affects their business operations.  Often these experiences focus on how they are concerned about the welfare of their employees and about Longmont as a community.  I listen intently to their views and often vote in ways they suggest.  We are lucky to have such people running businesses, serving on the Policy Committee and as contributors to the civic good
 
As the curriculum writer and teacher workshop trainer for Lessons on Local Government (LOLG), I provide training and classroom materials for k-12 teachers in all parts of the state.  LOLG is sponsored by the Colorado Municipal League and the Special District Association of Colorado.  All four types of local government in Colorado are featured (Towns/cities, Counties, School Districts and Special Districts).  As such, we encourage teachers to invite all kinds of local leaders into their classrooms to connect with students by exploring the vast array of services provided by local government.  Each year we run a calendar contest for elementary students that focus on Community Helpers.  Students create posters that highlight local government programs and servants.  The winners are selected to appear in a calendar.  We also encourage teachers and students to use local issues to spur interest in local government, as you can imagine, those issues vary greatly across the state, everything from building reservoirs, to managing mosquitos, to bike paths, to school safety.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Our democracy needs this, we have become very polarized to what seems to be an unhealthy level.  Part of that polarization seems to come from too many districts drawn to ensure winners from one political party.  More competitive districts and or some more balanced combinations ought to be explored.  We need to listen to each other a little bit better and rebuild the middle of our political spectrum.   I also want to practice what I teach.   My career as a social studies educator has been focused on helping students and future teachers create knowledgeable, thoughtful, engaged citizens.  Encouraging civic duty has been part of those lessons.  This commission provides me with an opportunity to practice civic duty by serving the community that has supported me for many years.   And maybe, just maybe, restore some trust in government and make our nation, our democracy a little bit better.   This article speaks to my deep belief in our system and in listening to each other.  https://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/29/of-education-patriotism-and-censorship/ . It is attached in extra documents.

<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a high school social studies teacher I had students from all backgrounds in my classroom. My job is to help them all become engaged and effective citizens regardless of political beliefs.   Part of that duty is to welcome, teach and promote civil conversations about contentious issues.   It is important that all students feel like they were honored and were heard.  It was equally important that the classroom was a safe place for students.   One commitment I make as a teacher is to educate all students who show up in my classroom - all of them. We work hard in my class at establishing discussion rules that allow for expression of diverse viewpoints grounded in a deep respect for each other.  That also requires me to get to know them all and find ways to connect kids and curriculum.  Here is an article I wrote for Chalkbeat that speaks to this idea in a political sense.  https://co.chalkbeat.org/2016/8/12/21098880/first-person-how-teachers-should-navigate-the-classroom-debate-during-a-polarizing-election-year.   It is attached in extra documents.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am at heart a teacher.  This requires constant application of multiple laws, rules and policies to practical considerations like curriculum choices, student interests, and parental concerns.  Teachers are not classroom monarchs able to do whatever they want.  We find ways to rationally convert these constraints into classroom practices that benefit our students and serve the public good. Balancing multiple interests is all part of daily practice for teachers.  

One of the great rules of life is that you need to know what the rules are.  This idea is helpful in the classroom and across all walks of life.   In social studies circles the idea is helpful with lessons applying the Constitution to students and schools.   Students appreciate wrestling with how to balance their desire to freedom with the common good necessary for a successful learning atmosphere.  My job as a teacher was to help students sort out their rights as expressed in the Constitution and detailed by court cases.  Once they understand the rules supplied by Supreme Court decisions concerning student rights they can apply them to new circumstances.  

Several years ago I served on a jury.   We were asked to apply the law to a set of facts presented by prosecutors and defense attorneys.  I ended up as the foreperson.  We had thoughtful and contentious deliberations for several hours going well into the evening.  The result, a hung jury.  All the jurors walked away from the experience both disappointed in that their side did not prevail, but also complementary and understanding of what the other side believed. It felt like justice was done, neither side had met its’ burden of proof.
