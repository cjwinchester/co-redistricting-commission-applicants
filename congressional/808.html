<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
While I consider myself to be a well-informed citizen, I haven&#39;t actively participated in any campaigns. I served as a poll-watcher for the GOP in Denver in 2018 and Arapahoe County in 2020. I made small donations to the GOP a few times since 2015; donated to Corey Gardner campaign in 2020; and donated to Lauren Boebert campaign in 2020.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I serve as a Board Member, and Chief Operating Officer of Colorado FIRST (Colorado non-profit) volunteer organization since 2004. I serve as a Board Member of Young Engineers Association (Colorado non-profit) volunteer organization since 2018. I am the lead mentor (volunteer) for the George Washington High School Robotics Team since 2005.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have spent most of my life dedicated to community service and it is a critical part of my life. In the early 1990s, I served as the Board President for the Will-O-Wisp Water and Sanitation District and brought the District out of the first bankruptcy of a Special District in the State of Colorado. I later served on our homeowners association and as President of the parent organization at my son&#39;s K-8 school, Rocky Mountain School of Expeditionary Learning where I coordinated community projects like playground construction and raising funds for buying buses. My extensive work (since 2004) as a volunteer for Colorado FIRST and the FIRST organization has centered around growing an organization to support STEM opportunities for K-12 students in Colorado. I have helped to bring this organization and program from a unincorporated group of supporters to a significant, all-volunteer, 501(c)3 serving over 5700 Colorado students annually. As the lead mentor, I have also managed and grown the robotics team at George Washington High School from a small, underfunded team, to one of the most competitive teams in the State.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am a second generation Colorado native and love this State! I want to make sure that everyone in the State of Colorado is represented in a fair way, taking into account communities of interest such as water, metro area concerns, natural resources, outdoor recreation and farming.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a Colorado native, I have lived in several parts of the State with differing viewpoints (Weld County, Garfield County, Park County, City &amp; County of Denver and Arapahoe County). I think this gives me a broader perspective which will allow me to help promote consensus among the commissioners. Through my volunteer work, I help manage thousands of volunteers and students which requires working through may types of issues and building consensus. In my role as Chief Operating Officer for Colorado FIRST, I am responsible for coordinating competitions for various programs held in our State. I also coach/mentor several teams that compete in these competitions. I have been able to maintain a firewall between these different responsibilities to assure fairness to all of the participants in these competitions.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
While no longer actively practicing, I am an attorney which requires applying logic and reason to problems. For over 25 years I have owned and run a small business that provides various computer-related consulting services and spent over a decade in the field solving technical issues for customers. I am a creative problem solver, able to apply logic and reason in ways that build consensus.
