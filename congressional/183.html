        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Chris Biondolilo</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Chris Biondolilo
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Christopher or Joseph Biondolilo</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Engineer, Project Manager, Business Development
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  BS Mechanical Engineering.  Also, some course work in MBA.  Professional engineer (PE) certificate/license in State of Colorado.  Project Management Professional (PMP) certificate from the Project Management Institute (PMI)
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80122
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
As a market director at my company, I manage diverse groups of people. As a senior project manager, I have consistently run teams of 50 or more people to successfully execute large projects. Strong team organization skills are required for these positions. I also have a long history of coaching youth sports, serving on school boards, volunteering to organize school events.  
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have twice been a delegate to the Republican State Assembly.  I have twice been a delegate to the 6th CD assembly.  I have also been a delegate to the Arapahoe county assembly.  I have consistently participated in the local precinct caucuses.  I have volunteered to work in several campaigns, knocking on doors, delivering signs, etc.; most recently, the Suzanne Staiert campaign and the Kathleen Conti Campaign.  I have also helped local precinct leaders with the get-out-the vote efforts. I have donated small amounts of money to numerous campaigns including Cory Gardner, Suzanne Staiert, Casper Stockham, Steve House, Mike Coffman, and Walker Stapleton. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I attend Arapahoe County Republican dinners, volunteer in church functions, and belong to professional industry organizations such as American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Project Management Institute.  I routinely attend Advanced Bioeconomy Leadership Conference. I have donated time and money to numerous charitable organizations.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to work with other team members to create a system of districts that promote healthy political involvement and results. I believe that our Colorado representatives should represent constituents of similar local concerns and not be far removed from many constituents located in the far reaches of a gerrymandered district.  For instance, the current CD6 map extends from Brighton to Centennial, CD 2 goes from the northern border to the southern tip of Jefferson County, and CD3 extends from Pueblo to Moffat counties.  I think we can do better. I think we can make fairer districts.  Colorado is a purple state that has had a tilt to either blue or red depending on the election in the last 25 years.  In most years, we should expect Colorado&#39;s 7 congressional districts to have a 4-3 split of major parties serving in the US House. In years, with significant sea changes or &quot;waves&quot; of one party preference, the split should be no more than 5-2. I think our founding fathers intend some degree of stability in government that is insulated from huge emotional swings as well as an inherent competitive nature.  In that light, I think we should have two reliably Republican districts, two reliably Democrat districts, one republican leaning district, one democrat leaning district and one very competitive district.  With that said, I will certainly listen to opinions and ideas of others on the commission.  I have observed and participated in Colorado politics for over 25 years.  I believe I can use this experience and my organizational experience to beneficially serve the state of Colorado. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I will try to find common ground for everyone&#39;s concerns. I believe all the commissioners will want the following goal: for our Colorado representatives to represent constituents of similar local concerns and not be far removed from constituents located in the far reaches of a gerrymandered district.  As demonstrated in my attached reference letters, I will listen to others concerns while promoting my ideas of stability and representative districts explained earlier.  I will not attack others of different political beliefs and will convey my ideas in a non-confrontational, objective manner..  I will keep the focus on providing fair districts that should result in a 4-3 split during most years and occasionally in a 5-2 split during sea change years. I will follow the rules provided set forth on this website.   I have observed and participated in Colorado politics for over 25 years.  I believe I can use this experience and my organizational experience to beneficially serve the state of Colorado. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am an engineer by degree, a project manager by training and experience. I direct a market at my company and am skilled at managing diverse teams of individuals.  I have experience at promoting collaboration with folks of different backgrounds.  I have provided reference letters to substantiate this experience.  Logic and reason is a must have skill for what I do, but I also possess softer skills required to work with many diverse folks.
