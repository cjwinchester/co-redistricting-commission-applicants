</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe very strongly that every voice matters equally, and that voters should choose their representatives rather than representatives choosing their voters. Gerrymandering is undemocratic, and the consequences of an uneven playing field can be seen in many states around our country whose congressional districts have been heavily gerrymandered. The will of the people can be ignored if their voices are stifled through undemocratic means. I want to serve on the commission because I have an undying belief that the United States can continue to be the beacon of hope to millions around the world, and I want to do my part to ensure that we continue to fairly represent everyone&#39;s voice.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
For the past six years, a large part of my job has been to promote consensus among my coworkers. Working as a software developer, then as a director, then as a VP of engineering, then as a director at my company&#39;s parent company, I have instilled in my teams the benefits of a bottom up approach, where everybody&#39;s opinions and suggestions are weighted equally. This has created an environment of trust and collaboration among my team. There is no &#39;right&#39; way to do something in software development - there are many ways to solve the same problem, meaning decisions are more subjective and personal biases always exist. To address this, I introduced a version of the scientific method, where my team members would introduce the problem they&#39;re trying to solve, their hypothesis for how they can solve it, metrics they will use to measure the results, and success criteria to determine whether their idea worked. We would also use this for changes to our processes. Every change had to follow this pattern. This allowed my team to debate a concrete plan instead of an abstract idea. It also gave my team the tools to plead their case and to try out an idea with the blessing of the team. The results had a big impact on my team&#39;s willingness to make changes to how we do things, because every change was analyzed to ensure it achieved its success criteria, and we were able to revert changes that did not meet our definition of success.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Logic and reasoning are at the heart of who I am - I thrive on brain teasers and logic problems, and am very comfortable analyzing large datasets to look for patterns that may be missed by others. For most of my career I was a software developer, where logic and reasoning are core competencies. During this time I honed my skills by working on high-value, complex projects in various industries including real estate, healthcare, and payment processing. At every one of my jobs I was recognized for my unique ability to analyze a problem from many different angles until I found the most elegant solution. There is an art to finding the balance between application performance and software maintainability, and, given my proven success at analyzing problems and consistently striking the right balance between these two, I was promoted multiple times from developer to director to VP. As I progressed in my career towards being a company leader, the problems I had to solve changed but my methodology did not. Instead of finding elegant ways to write code, I had to find ways to balance the needs and wants of my team with the business and financial constraints of my company. I used data to back every decision, which enabled all relevant parties to understand why a decision had been made. 

One example of my analytic and reasoning skills at work is when I was tasked with implementing a Business Intelligence solution at my company to better understand our customers. Upon analysis of the data, I discovered that our legacy billing system had been erroneously undercharging a large portion of our customers for years and we were losing out on almost $150k/month. Through my analysis, we were able to correct the issue and add almost $2 million dollars to our annual revenue.
