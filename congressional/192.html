</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
a.	Advocating and working for the betterment of our community is a passion that I have both in my professional and personal life.  Personally, I have volunteered on the family ministry team at Jefferson Unitarian Church for six years.  In that capacity, I helped develop programs to help children and their parents connect to community and themselves.  Our specific focus is providing teaching about actively working together toward peace, love, and justice for all people regardless of their background, and instilling that ethic in our children.  I also began and lead my daughter&#39;s Girl Scout Troop.  Our family was a founding member of the Ha Makhom Jewish Community on the west side of Denver.  Professionally, I am committed to changing the face of divorce and reducing trauma on all participants, particularly the children.  I believe that if we can change the expectation and culture of divorce we can change our community for the better in the long run by reducing conflict and increasing positive outcomes.  I have been on the board of the Colorado Collaborative Divorce Professionals for five years.  I am the president of that organization for 2020, and was vice president in 2019.  In that capacity, I am helping grow collaborative and out of court divorce by organizing state-wide meetings, leading the trainings for new interdisciplinary professionals, developing curriculum for both introductory and advanced trainings, and am working on growing membership outside of the Denver Metro.  I have been an active participant in getting the Uniform Collaborative Law Act through the legislature--we hope it passes soon.  I have testified before Colorado legislature committees multiple times in support of the bill, and have coordinated with legislators of both parties to seek the passage of this bill.  I have been actively involved in creating positive change in my community since I was in high school in rural Texas, and that continued through participation and growth in the four year Leadership Institute at my rural Texas college Austin College.  Leading my community to increasing justice and equity has been a central defining feature of my personality since I was a teenager, and I want to bring that to my community now.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My family has been in Colorado since 1864, and I feel a deep and abiding connection with this state and its people.  I have always felt that there was something more that I could do to help not just my local community directly near me, but to help people across our state.  When I heard of this opportunity, something inside of me said that this was my chance to have a larger reach and to help my state.  I do not believe that running for office is the best choice for my personality, but a commission is something that I can do to volunteer to help my community in a lasting and profound way.  I believe that representation matters.  While I am white, I am a woman who has faced sexism and glass ceilings throughout my life.  I am also the parent to Jewish children, and I have witnessed in our own household the profound validation and sense of belonging that representation of their culture brings to them.  If I can help bring that same representation and sense of validity and belonging for other minority communities, then I will know in the core of my being that I have done what I can to make our country a substantially better place.  I deeply believe in the democratic system, and that all people should have quality and reflective representation.  I am so honored to live in Colorado where I believe that our government reflects that democratic principal.  Many states in this country seem to not have that same commitment to representation and voter enfranchisement.  I hope that my participation in one of the first non-partisan redistricting commissions in the country can help pave the way for larger change in this county by encouraging its use in other states as well.

<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Attending the 40 hour mediation training with Judy Mares-Dixon in 2013 was one of the most profound experiences of my life.  Before the training, I was quite a typical lawyer.  A woman does not get through law school and be a successful attorney by being focused on conciliation and peace making.  But after that training, I realized that actively working for agreement and conciliation creates lasting and profound change in the parties, not just something that is a band-aid, something that will work well enough.  I understood at a much deeper level how people function when facing fear and uncertainty, and how to help guide them to a place of consensus and more peace.  It changed how I speak to people and how I conduct myself in the world every single day.  I have dedicated my business and personal life to creating solutions for the problems around me.  I have continued my training with another 40 hour advanced training from Ms. Mares-Dixon (twice—because I can never learn too much), collaborative divorce trainings (which I now teach), and continuing to hone my skills in consensus building. 
My entire business and career are focused on finding consensus between often warring parties who are getting a divorce or handling a probate situation.  As either a lawyer or a mediator, I specialize in creating out-of-court solutions for our clients, and I’m glad to say that I have about a 95% success rate.  In order to have this success, I have to negotiate with, and handle personalities of, many different parties.  In a divorce, I navigate a way to get my client, their spouse, the spouse’s attorney, and often any other relevant parties (children, client’s parents, etc) to reach an agreement that is acceptable to all of them.  This requires a deep understanding of how humans work, and creative approaches to a problem that will meet the needs of everyone involved.  I use interest-based negotiation.  When I am helping families, I try to drill down to the real need of the person, not just what they say they want on the surface.  Someone may say that they absolutely have to stay in the house, even though they can’t afford it.  However, perhaps the need that they have is stability.  So if we can identify that need and find another way to meet it, we can create solutions that are practical and acceptable to all parties so that they can move forward to a more successful future. 
A joke around the office is that I should really be a judge because I always take the approach of listening fairly to both sides, and not just believing our client.  One of the ways that I am able to actively create solutions for clients is by deeply listening to them.  I don’t just listen for what they say, but what they are not saying.  I help them tease out what is really important for them so that we can reach that goal.  I use the skill of impartiality and really listening to needs every day in my firm. 
Additionally, I believe that my experience growing up in a rural area will be extremely helpful.  While my family has been in Colorado since 1864, I grew up in the very rural Texas panhandle.  This is the area that voted the most overwhelmingly for Trump of any single area in the nation.  I am deeply rooted in conservativism and the needs of the rural population.  I can meet them where they are and hear their concerns in a deep and meaningful way.  I am not registered for either party because I do not believe that a party encapsulates any single person or issue.  I have voted for both parties after doing my research into the actual people, and I believe that is a critical requirement of every citizen.  It is also because I understand the needs of rural communities, and how they are very different from those of the cities.  I believe that I can bring my personal history and professional skills of finding agreements among very divergent parties to create consensus among commissioners.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
a.	As an attorney, my career is based on using my analytical and logical skills to identifying, narrowing, and solving problems.  This ability to dissect, parse, and solve logical and intellectual questions is a core part of why I am a lawyer, and what I love to do.  However, I think that commissioners need even more than that to be truly successful in their mission. It is important for the selection committee to look beyond logic and analytical skills as applied to intellectual problems.  It needs to find committee members who can identify the human emotions, needs, concerns, and fears that underly people’s positions, so that these can also be reflected in re-districting.  I believe that no issue is solely logical and intellectual, nor is it purely emotional.  The true key will be blending the ability to identify the humanity in the huge task, and use logic and analysis to reach consensus.
