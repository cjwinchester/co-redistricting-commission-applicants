<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My life has been filled with complex projects involving multiple stakeholders. It never gets easier but there are certainly best practices. 
When I chaired the Colorado Commission on Family Medicine, working with residency directors across the state, we kept our primary mission at the forefront. No matter the politics of the day, our goal was filling Colorado’s family medicine residencies, and we did that—really well. 
When I helped create Friends of Colorado State Parks, our goal was to create a network for people who love the state parks and a way for those people to provide support through donations and acts of service. It often felt like herding cats, but the outcomes were positive and worth the effort.
I have often found myself working on efforts to support and advance women. I established the Women’s Forum at First Data/Western Union to support women across the enterprise in their growth and advancement. My work with the Colorado Women’s Alliance and the National Women’s Advisory Network for the Job Creators Network are about addressing women in the workplace. Sometimes the obstacles are great, requiring legislative action. At other times, it might be a subtle cultural shift that opens doors and creates opportunities.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As a native Coloradan, I have a particular love for our beautiful state. We used to be a “cow town”, and now we are a thriving international place. That growth has come at some cost, and we turn to our elected officials to help manage the changes.
For our elected officials to have success, we owe it to them to create districts that make sense. They do not have to be homogenous, but they should support a belief among the voters that their officials do indeed represent them.
While redistricting can be controversial, it can also be open and fair, and that is the approach I will take if you select me. We can have an honest look at the needs of the state today and a respectful conversation about how to best represent us all going forward.
No one knows for sure what the future holds, but we can imagine that Colorado will continue growing and standing at the forefront of innovative for the country. We need our districts and elected officials to reflect that.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Listen first, talk second. Do your homework before the meeting. Be open to alternative views. Don’t jump to conclusions. These are just some of the axioms that apply in this kind of complex situation. 
There are no easy answers, so finding the best possible answer requires a special kind of patience and perseverance. The anchor is deciding up front that everyone at the table has something important to share, and that the process will take time, so settle in for a thoughtful and thorough discussion. 

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
On the scale, I am a “creative”, meaning I take in all available information and use it to look for multiple possibilities and solutions. It is an ability to see the available data from a variety of viewpoints, and find solutions that meet the needs of the widest possible audience.
At the same time, I am also an organizer. Labels facing forward in the pantry, shoes lined up on the shelf. GPS may provide solid directions on the iPhone, but it’s not the same as working with a printed map. Data is best when it is presented in its most accessible format (love clean excel spreadsheets).
Applying logic and reason to a problem starts with doing the homework, knowing the information, and being prepared for a thoughtful discussion.
