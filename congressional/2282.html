<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
In colorado springs another woman and I began PPA future which was a group of concerned citizens rallying to get city council to create oil and gas regulations for the city and county.  We held meetings monthly, had a website and facebook page and had speakers like Josh Fox and Wes Wilson come speak to our members and to city council.   I was a member of OW attending GA and helping with our social media out reach.  For just myself I started the &#39;No fracking in Colorado Springs&#39; Page on FB and used it to get information out about upcoming events and situations across the country and world that had to do with oil and gas.  
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I was involved with Occupy Wallstreet in 2011-2013 at which point I began attending city council meetings in Colorado Springs in regards to oil and gas regulations and MJ legalization and sales. I have donated to the Progressive Democrats of America in regards to getting Bernie Sanders to run. I got involved in Bernie Sanders campaign as soon as he announced and have been donating to him in small increments since.  I have also donated to various races across the country that were tied to his policy proposals. 

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Prior to 11/2015 I was involved in a few organizations but since then I have basically been a PCP for my district servicing 2 terms. 

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Redistricting is such a very important aspect of our democracy that most citizens don&#39;t even know about.  When I heard on NPR that this commission was being put together I shared it on my social media and made sure to try to get out the word. I really feel like keeping a district fair and balanced can seriously shape how our democracy looks. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
While I admit that I am very progressive because of that I feel like it is important to include everyone in how we behave in regards to voting and the ability to open avenues for it to everyone- regardless of their own view points.  I can and do look at both sides of every issue before I make my own decisions.  I care more about the collective than I do about just myself. It isn&#39;t always an easy position to be in but I feel that we all pledge to a social contract when we are part of a society and sometimes that means letting my own desires put aside in order to help others.  In this I believe I would be an asset to a larger group.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have always been a person who can look at different sides to a problem or question and find weaknesses and strengths within it.  While being very outgoing I can take time to sit back and listen to someone else&#39;s perspective and add that to my own decisions about a problem to help find a solution that works for the most instead of the few.
