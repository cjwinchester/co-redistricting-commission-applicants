<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have never worked for any campaigns or political organizations.  Since Nov 2015, I have made political contributions to Cory Gardner, Martha McSally, Tim Scott, Joni Ernst, Huck PAC, National Republican Congressional Committee, National Republican Senatorial Committee, Ted Cruz, Mia Love, College Republicans, and Stapleton for Colorado.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have been a volunteer Advocate for CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) of the Pikes Peak Region (PPR) continuously since 2009.
I served on the Board of Directors for the Pikes Peak Chapter of the Barbershop Harmony Society (BHS) continuously from 2009 through 2016, including four years as Chapter Secretary and three years as Chapter President.
Since Jan 2019 I have served on the Board of Directors of the Rocky Mountain District of the Barbershop Harmony Society, as the VP for Events.  The Rocky Mountain District includes BHS chapters in some or all of 9 states: Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, Utah, New Mexico, Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
     As a volunteer CASA Advocate, an appointed officer of the court, I have advocated within the judicial process for children who are subjects of Dependency and Neglect (D&amp;N) cases in El Paso County.  I have represented their interests, desires and needs to the court to make sure that court decisions take into account the childrens&#39; needs for safety, security, and a stable, long-term placement, with family if possible, or in an adoptive relationship if necessary.  I have also represented CASA of the PPR in speaking to multiple community groups, in an effort to recruit additional volunteer advocates for the organization.  Since 2012, I have served CASA as a volunteer Peer Coordinator, coaching and mentoring new Advocates, to help them learn how to better advocate within the system for the children they represent.
     Since 2006, I have been an active volunteer and donor for Pikes Peak United Way (PPUW).  I have served as a volunteer community member of their Fund Allocation Committee, evaluating grant requests from community agencies and developing recommendations for funding priorities.  I have also served as a volunteer Loaned Executive, speaking to community groups about the impact of PPUW and seeking donations to the organization.  In this way I have helped raise money to advance the work of dozens of social service agencies in the El Paso County area.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
We live in a representative democracy, where citizens&#39; votes elect those who will represent them in state and federal legislative bodies.  It is vital that these elected officials effectively and conscientiously represent the interests of their constituents, both to encourage legislation that benefits them, and to assure the voters that their representatives are giving their best efforts on the voters&#39; behalf.  Sound redistricting decisions, when made with a minimum of partisan pressure, can improve the probability that both these aims will be realized.  On the other hand, a partisan redistricting process increases the possibility that representatives will act primarily in their own personal interest, since the resulting gerrymandered districts help assure them of reelection, no matter how well or poorly they serve.  Colorado has established a new redistricting process that is admirably (although not completely) free of partisan bias.  I want to support that process with my personal efforts, both to help assure that Colorado voters have confidence in their representatives and to be part of an example to other states that such a process is both feasible and effective.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
     In my 30-year experience as a Navy officer, I rose to the rank of Captain (O-6).  My career included two assignments as a Commanding Officer, and multiple assignments as an Acquisition Manager and Program Manager, as well as operational assignments, leading large and small teams of military and civilian personnel, both ashore and afloat.  In all these leadership positions, my focus was on making each individual in my organization successful, because that is how the mission gets done.  In a team of 6 or 600 people, maximum effectiveness is achieved when those individual efforts are harnessed and focused on the same goal, and each individual feels both empowered and rewarded in his/her work.  In addition, my work in fundraising and in recruiting volunteers has taught me to listen to others, find out what motivates them, and tap into that motivation to advance a community effort.   I also served for the first four years of my Navy career as a mathematics instructor in the Navy&#39;s Nuclear Power School, and I have been a volunteer math tutor at the high school and college level since 2006.  This teaching/tutoring experience has helped me develop the ability to perceive whether or not a student understands the material, and to tailor my assistance to address the student&#39;s particular needs to achieve success.  Finally, I served for more than 15 years as an administrative leader in a religious congregation, including volunteer work as Administrative Board Chairman, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, and Chairman of two separate Capital Funds Drives.  In these positions I learned and practiced the skills required to lead and motivate volunteers, skills which are different from those required in a military or commercial organization.
     So I have extensive experience in focussing individual motivations and efforts on a common goal, and in helping others become successful;  I believe I can harness this experience  to promote consensus and advance agreement among the commissioners.
     All of us believe we can be fair and impartial.  The only sure proof of fairness (lack of bias) and impartiality (lack of favoritism) is in a person&#39;s record of performance, and in the degree to which others believe that person&#39;s decisions are based on facts and sound reasoning, rather than simply opinions and personal preferences.  I think that my solid record of success in military and civilian employment, in volunteer work, and in teaching and tutoring provides ample evidence that the people who worked with and for me and those for whom I worked all believed I was honest, straightforward, focused on the job at hand, and made decisions without regard to personal bias or preference.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
     My academic experience in mathematics and engineering helped me develop and apply the analytical skills required to break a problem into its key components, identify both facts and assumptions underlying the situation, decide on a logical course of action, and execute the actions required to reach a solution.  In my teaching and tutoring experience I have consistently emphasized this approach with my students.  As a Program Manager, I successfully planned and executed complex system development projects with budgets of up to $500million, on time, on target, and within budget.  This success depended directly on my ability to to accurately analyze the goal to be achieved, and to develop a logical, effective approach within the resources available.
     In addition, I am a self-taught amateur woodworker; my usual projects are furniture and gifts for my family and friends, and theater sets for one or two local community theater groups.  In these projects I almost never have a set of plans to work with.  I have to analyze the need (the furniture&#39;s function and environment, or the requirements of the actors, director, and playwright for the physical acting space); develop an approach that is consistent with available materials, budget, tools, and skills; and execute the task on time and on budget, to the satisfaction of the client.  I totally enjoy this unpaid work, because it involves both problem-solving and developing and applying my manual skills to produce a functional and (in some cases at least) artistic product.  
     So I think it&#39;s fair to say that analytic skills, logic, and reason have been part of my education, employment and leisure pursuits my entire adult life.  I enjoy the feeling of accomplishment that comes from successfully applying these skills to all the challenges I&#39;ve faced.
