<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Nothing outside the politics of working public retail management including sales/owner/operator in the automotive repair field. Though it may sound irrelevant to this cause, there is much ado about politics that occur behind those scenes to create an agreeable outcome for all parties, in reality. That is the true purpose of good politics, and not to stab all others in the face while you pat their back saying &quot;it will be fine, give me more money&quot;.
</p>

I have donated to RNC; Trump campaigns and Corey Gardner 
</p>

<p>
None
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
It is time I get more involved in making sure my grand children have a say in their future, and that of their children and so on. We finally have a real leader to stand with us in the White House to fight this. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I stand to speak for more than one forgotten class/category of people.
1. Women over 50
2. Disabled women, over 50
3. &#39;Single&#39; women ( over 50)
4. Lower income, middle class 
5. SSI/SSDI/ADA/Medicare clients
6. Child (grand child) in home affected by school and child care/health care changes due to funding redirects from redistricting, etc
7. Young working adults with and without children
8. Homeowners (property taxes, mill levy&#39;s, etc
9. Skilled in trades but not certified no degree
10. Medical and recreational marijuana facilities; patrons; owners; employees, State req&#39;s, etc

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I tend to be a natural advocate for the unknown, unheard of and thought of as well. 
When need arises for solutions, my mind has worked out several before I suggest even one...and usually before others clearly understand the issue. Its ironic you use the term &quot;analytical&quot;. That is my strongest and most used saving grace, other than that of the Great Almighty who graced me with it and his protection, that is. I can&#39;t honestly take credit for my natural analytic skills, only for honing them. 
Logic seems to be lost in current day society, especially in governance. What I call logic, many others call impossible. 
Scenario: 
Intensely cold snowy 6 degree morning, 
car will not start
only transportation to work
what to do? quickly
Most people call off work, or report they&#39;ll be late
Some will call a cab
Many would call a tow truck
Others will open the hood and attempt to jump
I open the hood, attach jump box
Still no cranking
Now call the boss, and someone to arrange a ride
I do not call a row truck or repair shop
I do not go buy a new battery
I do not risk illness and injury in the inclement weather
I wait. 
When the weather warms I check wires and connections for loose, frayed, broken or dead short
Now I try to jump start again. Then decide the next steps.
I just relayed to you the basic conversation with my son when this came up from last storm. It was the right way to deal with it too, as it turns out. It was a faulty connection causing a draw while it sat. 
The aforementioned groups &quot;most&quot; &quot;some&quot; and  &quot;many&quot; are the very type of people I used to rely on for work in the auto repair field because they rely on people like me. I was the face of the company. The tester, estimator, negotiator - on all sides, i.e. cost to customer vs cost to company - as well as the public relations and human relations, business to business sales and coop coordinator/closer; customer sales, negotiator/deal closer; and more. All while overseeing schedules for techs and work orders to attain and maintain smoother operations; parts manager; tear down technician; assess and clean units; liaison between shop and office admin; R&amp;R tech assistant; torque converter specialist AND shop driver for multiple tasks and errands, including customer transport and banking. I was the universal joint for the drivetrain of a fast moving vehicle, essentially. Its is also, by nature, one of my strengths to assume that role and way of thinking in all aspects I possibly can. I can apply my strength and balance to the reasoning process to avert illogical attempts at a solution. These character traits usually quickly become valued and relied upon in anything I take on. I may not be able yo make 100% of the people happy, but I do my best to include 100% in my thinking and problem solving. the 2-3% I fall short did and do matter to me, being unlike the politicians and all/.
