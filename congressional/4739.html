<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated to Hickenlooper for Senate, Biden/Harris, Hillary Clinton 2016, Obama for President 2008 and 2012, Perlmutter, Fair Fight and the Senate Races in GA, Jaime Harrison, Pete Buttigieg, Jerry DiTullio Jeffco Treasurer, Val Beck Wheat Ridge City Council
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I serve on the Wheat Ridge CO Planning Commission, was appointed to the Wheat Ridge Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy committee , was the President of the board for Wheat Ridge Local Works, worked on several ballot measures in Wheat Ridge, CO.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a member of Localworks I worked with committees to promote the city of Wheat Ridge as a vibrant place to live. That work began in 2012 and ended in 2018. As a member of the Neighborhood Revitalization committee we had to meet with members of the community and collect ideas from all factions and present our findings to city staff and council as to what direction the citizens wanted Wheat Ridge to become. I have always, since high school, been involved in collaborative efforts to bring about change or improve something. Usually as the leader of the group. (Show up, speak up, and listen. Do what you say you’re going to do. That’s me). I was Student Council President in High School and Junior Class President at Fort Hays St University. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Because I believe that districting should be fairly divided so that both parties have representation. Districts should not favor one party over another. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have Steven Covey training, seek first to understand and then be understood. I don’t desire to be in charge of anything or push any agenda. I have led lots of groups as a facilitator and can help groups stay focused and on track. I can teach people how to stand on their head, so I can also explain a process or concept and help people overcome fear  And I can lead a group in breathing exercises to help calm everyone down! 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I was a technical writer for 7 years. I had to take an engineer’s explanation for how software worked and translate it so an end user would know what to do. I have the ability from that experience to take a high-level view to any situation. I also learned that skill in graduate school. I also worked in instructional design prior to being a technical writer, so from that I learned to ask a lot of questions.
