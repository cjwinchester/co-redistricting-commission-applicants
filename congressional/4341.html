<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Donated to Bernie Sander&#39;s campaign in 2016, other than that mostly just paying attention to what is going on. Looking to have more impact by working with the redistricting. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
FoodBank of the Rockies
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I understand the concepts of gerrymandering and a large interest in participating in this commission is to avoid that from happening. Our state has some very diverse communities and I want to make sure that everyone&#39;s voice is heard. I love the idea at looking over a map, understanding the political, racial, financial, and religious differences of everyone in the state and getting them representation. Aside from donating to BLM I have not participated in these types of organizations.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Everyone counts! Everyone in our state matters, whether or not they have the same opinions as I do. I would like to believe that the entire point of this commission is to be fair and impartial to assigning districts. I believe that I can be fair and help bring others together. Aside from my current job, I would have plenty of time to focus on this commission and believe I could be a great asset. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have experience with leading teams of software engineers and have grown greatly over the years in doing so. There are hundreds of ways to build software and everyone will do it differently. I&#39;ve used many different techniques to gain agreement from others, whether it is simple pro/con lists, or a lot of times just walking through a problem step by step on how each person views it so that we all can better understand where they are coming from. A large piece of it is just trying to step back and listen to all sides. 
I once served on a 6 or 7 person jury, largely older men, in Denver that was a civil lawsuit for someone that got into a car accident and was suing the insurance company. When we went into deliberations they elected me as a foreman. I started off by going around the room and asking where everyone stood. Three of them were on the plaintiff&#39;s side, I was on on the defendant&#39;s, and the others were undecided. 
I spent time just listening to everyone&#39;s arguments, and we looked through all of the documentation. The man had pre-existing conditions in his sacrum region. We drew a timeline on the whiteboard of all of his shots he received for pain, when the accident was, how long the shots lasted, etc. We worked out as a team that it was over a month after his accident that he started feeling pain, this also coincided with the same duration of time when his shot would normally wear out. In the end, we all sided with the defendant. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Aside from the story from the last question, my career requires me to think through problems and analyze data. I work with SQL databases, both architectural design and querying them for relevant data. This also includes geospatial and geofencing type of data. I also architect and build end user systems that require a lot of thought on simplifying complex problems. I have a large amount of experience in &quot;big data&quot; tools such as streaming services like Kafka or NATS and data warehouse technologies like Snowflake and Google BigQuery. 
I could give you several examples and stories where I had to solve tough problems, such as on some Android phones when a user would take 1 picture with our application it would work fine. However if the user took more than 1 picture it would crash the app. Also debugging wouldn&#39;t work over the USB. It took some time but I guessed that we were trying to allocate memory for uploading the pictures at the same time and would cause the application to run out of memory. Sure enough, by using the same memory location for each upload it would work fine (but slower).
