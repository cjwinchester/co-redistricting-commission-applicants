        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Matthew Appelbaum</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Matthew Appelbaum
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Retired from a career as a software architect, designing and implementing complex software systems and training developers how to effectively use them. Starting at Bell Labs, I then worked at several start-up companies in Boulder.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  M.S. Computer Science, University of Wisconsin - Madison. B.S. Mathematics, CUNY Brooklyn College.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80303
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Mayor, City of Boulder, 2009 and 2011 - 2015 during city council terms from 1987 - 1995 and then 2007 - 2015. Board of Directors, National League of Cities. Board of Directors, Colorado Municipal League. Vice-chair, Denver Metro Mayors Caucus. Board of Directors, ICLEI USA, an international organization of sustainable cities.
Contributions since 2015 included numerous political campaigns, notably: Biden, Hickenlooper, Bennet, Democratic House and Senate Campaigns both nationally and in Colorado, Democratic county commissioner campaigns in Boulder County, and numerous non-partisan city council campaigns in the City of Boulder.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Boulder City Council, National League of Cities, Colorado Municipal League until I left office in November 2017.  I currently serve on RTD&#39;s Citizen Advisory Committee and Boulder&#39;s East Boulder Subcommunity Working Group. I continue to serve on the Board of ICLEI USA, as well as the international council of the ICLEI World Secretariat. I also am on the Board of the WaterNow Alliance, which helps foster sustainable water practices. And I have contributed to a wide variety of local organizations that support social services and the natural world.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As Boulder&#39;s mayor and long-time councilmember, it is fair to say that I have considerable experience representing citizens and advocating for their interests, and dealing with issues that were often contentious. At the regional, state, and national levels I have similarly had considerable experience at the National League of Cities, the Colorado Municipal League, the Denver Metro Mayors Caucus, the US36 Mayors and Commissioners Coalition, and the Denver Regional Council of Governments; at these organizations I worked hard, and often succeeded, at finding consensus on a wide range of issues, including transportation, growth and development, energy and natural resource protection, and city/state/federal relationships. I&#39;ve also served on the boards of the local Sierra Club chapter and PLAN-Boulder County, where I often advocated for their positions with local political bodies.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Well, I&#39;m a policy wonk, a data wonk, and I have a very strong sense of fairness, so this commission not only plays to my strengths, but would also give me a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help ensure our democracy&#39;s critical electoral process is as fair and representative as possible.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
During my many years in political office, and while serving on the numerous committees noted earlier, I believe that I earned a reputation for listening to all viewpoints, representing my (and my constituents&#39;) opinions in a respectful manner, finding consensus by having a deep understanding of the issues and the key arguments from all sides, ensuring that the underlying facts were understood and acknowledged, and being delighted at learning a relevant fact or opinion that I had failed to consider even though that might well make my position less viable.
While serving on a multi-year working group that was investigating the potential of a statewide transportation ballot issue, I not surprisingly found that I had a rather different set of priorities than committee members from less urban parts of the state. But many of those representatives quickly became friends as I better understood their perspectives and they mine, and as we honestly and often quite directly debated our various points of view, an approach that helped us attain general consensus on issues that had seemed intractable.
At the Denver Metro Mayors Caucus, to be blunt, representatives from Boulder were often seen as misfits, but I quickly was appointed to the executive committee and then become vice-chair, while still clearly speaking up for Boulder&#39;s perspective on regional issues but, again, in an honest and respectful way, and offering recommendations that often were successful at garnering consensus at this group with strongly held opinions.
Finally, regarding this commission, while I am obviously a Democrat, my elected positions have always been non-partisan and I strictly held to that constraint, as I would most certainly while considering redistricting issues. In fact, it is hard to think of a role where fairness and impartiality would be more essential.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As noted, I&#39;m a confirmed data wonk, but with an important twist. Yes, I do understand complex data sets and tend to be analytical to a fault thanks to my math and computer science background. But I also understand when and how data can lead you astray. I have taught a class on the misuse and misunderstanding of data at conferences held by the International City Managers Association and the National League of Cities, using numerous examples of data from cities and in the news to demonstrate how we can be so easily fooled and misled by seemingly (and often actually) valid data by misunderstanding and misinterpreting the deluge of information we face in our policy roles. To be sure, much good decision-making relies on data for critical background information, but policy decisions rarely can or should be delivered by computer algorithm. I&#39;m well aware that modern algorithms can quickly provide vast amounts of information about redistricting, and that indeed will be critical to the success of this commission -- but it cannot replace the non-numeric analysis that must consider all of the characteristics of a fair redistricting scheme that satisfies not only the commission members but also the citizens of Colorado. That is an unusual skill that I believe I can bring to the commission, as I have honed it over the many years both in my &quot;real&quot; job as a computer scientist and also as a political leader.
