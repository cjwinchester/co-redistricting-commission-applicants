  Ashley Bean
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a small business owner. I have been a self-employed dog walker for the past two years. My business is called Wiggle Monsters LLC. Please see attached resumé.

</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in History from Colorado College. I am also a licensed EMT-Basic. Please see attached resumé
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated money to John Hickenlooper, Diane Mitsch Bush, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am a member of Roaring Fork Valley for Racial Justice, which is a social organization aimed at finding opportunities to improve racial equity in our community.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My background in medicine and patient care makes me particularly interested in protecting the safety of nurses, doctors, and other healthcare professionals. During the beginning of the pandemic this spring, I travelled around the Roaring Fork Valley collecting new and used ski goggles to donate to hospitals in need. I collected close to 100 pairs of goggles, sending care packages with the sanitized protective equipment, as well as letters of encouragement and solidarity, to hospitals in Wagoner, OK, Germantown, Puerto Rico, and the Weld County Jail here in Colorado. 

I am an active member of my community. There are a great many first- and second-generation immigrant families living in my town, and I prioritize  patronizing their businesses. I keep my Spanish skills sharp so that I may be of assistance to any person who may need it.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve Colorado. Our state has an outstanding tradition of involving Colorado&#39;s citizens in the political process, from ballot initiatives to this independent redistricting commission, and I would be honored to be a part of this process. I look forward to the opportunity to learn about how congressional districts are drawn, and how exactly citizens will be involved in making such important decisions for Colorado. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Last year I was selected as a juror in a four-day trial here in the 9th Judicial District. It was a profound experience. I saw firsthand the process that enables citizens to be a part of the decisions we make for our community. It felt as though we were serving the defendant as well, and I listened intently to every single word that was spoken during the trial. During deliberations, it was our responsibility to sort through the information we had been given, set any emotions aside, and make a gravely important decision regarding the future of one of our fellow Americans. 

When presented with the responsibility to be fair and impartial to a man who was facing prison time for his alleged involvement in the aftermath of a murder, I found that it was easy to look objectively at the facts presented.  We were all the same race, but we were all different ages and from all different walks of life. The 12 of us did not agree when we first began deliberations, but we but we went around the room, giving each person the opportunity to speak, as we worked through the juror&#39;s instructions. I was amazed at how smoothly it went, but it also made sense, as we took our responsibility to the defendant very seriously. 

Serving on this re-districting committee would also be a sacred civic responsibility, and I would commit to be fair, impartial, and agreeable to my fellow citizens serving on the committee. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
With 12 years of experience as an EMT, I have learned to analyze situations without using emotion to impair my judgment. The dynamic nature of running a small business has also taught me to problem-solve while thinking on my feet. 

As a ski patroller I served as an Accident Investigator for three years. In my training, and the workshops I attended, I learned to gather facts from as many witnesses as possible, take the time to measure every angle and waypoint, and generate a formal, written investigation of the incident for use by the ski area&#39;s legal team in courts of law.  It was my responsibility to produce these investigations in such a way that I showed no partiality to the ski area, nor to the guest affected by the incident. The best way to do this is apply logic and reason to the problem of generating a fair report.
