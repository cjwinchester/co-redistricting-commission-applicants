        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Alexander Thomas</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Alexander Thomas
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Alex Thomas </span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I currently work for Aspen Skiing Company, primarily in marketing, but work across all primary departments. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I moved to Colorado to attend Colorado State University in 2009. I completed an undergraduate degree in Natural Resource Recreation and Tourism and went on to receive my Masters from CSU in Tourism Management in May of 2014. These two-degree programs focused on sustainable tourism development, business, research, and a personal focus on Ski Area Management. Since graduation, I have worked for Aspen Skiing Company which offers a variety of internal learning opportunities, and have achieved a Six Sigma Green Belt from Purdue University (online) to assist with many of the projects I work on within the ski company. In addition, I have attended Colorado Mountain College for the occasional class and continue to learn through various online platforms like Linkedin Learning. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81621
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been a registered democrat since 2009 when I turned 18. I was initially registered in Ohio but have voted in every possible election in Colorado since 2010 upon moving to Colorado and have donated money to most democratic campaigns in Colorado and for presidential races. Polis campaigns since moving to Colorado, Obama in 2012, Clinton in 2016, Bernie Sanders in 2016, Elizabeth Warren in 2019/20, Pete Buttigieg in 2020, John Hickenlooper for Senate in 2020, and Diane Mitsch Bush for Congress in 2020. In addition, I was a trained volunteer for a Get-Out-To-Vote effort for Protect Our Winters (POW), but did not end up volunteering due to Covid-19. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I was a board member for the Basalt Chamber&#39;s Marketing Advisory Board for about 8 months in 2016 before being wrapped up by the Chamber. I am a member of the Snowmass Rotary Club since January of 2020, and am an Advisory Board Member and Athlete with the Aspen Men&#39;s lacrosse club since 2016. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have limited experience thus far in my career. I currently manage marketing research efforts for Aspen Skiing Company and work with industry partners within Colorado, the Mountain West, and some international resorts. In addition, I manage the public/private co-operative research efforts with the Aspen Chamber and Snowmass Tourism.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
This is an opportunity to be involved to create a fair and equitable opportunity for every Colorado resident. I am not one for traditional volunteering with political campaigns but believe I would excel in a more analytical role to provide everyone with a more equitable voice in future elections. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe in taking a holistic approach that is sensible and pragmatic. I am not someone who takes offense or holds a grudge and wants to create districting maps that are equitable for every Coloradoan. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My current role manages marketing research efforts for Aspen Skiing Company. I started as a surveyor collecting the raw data and now manage the research program in its entirety. Pre-Covid, I had a staff for ~40 collecting feedback, while also managing digital collection methods (email, QR, WIFI, etc.), administer focus groups, and benchmark the resort against others in the industry. My role is to take the raw data, report the findings, and make suggestions based on actionable insights. I interface with guests on an everyday basis and work with senior leadership and ownership to determine opportunities to continually improve the Aspen Snowmass experience. I feel that I am quite analytical and can thrive with this opportunity.
