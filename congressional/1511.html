<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Act Blue 2016-2018
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am the head of Hawthorne Park Neighborhood Association in downtown Grand Junction.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Approximately six years ago I resurrected a defunct neighborhood association (Hawthorne Park)  to advocate for neighbors when we felt the City of Grand Junction was prioritizing outside developers over locals. In this position, I worked with other neighborhood leaders as well as the Downtown Development Authority and the City of Grand Junction Planning Department to act as a representative for local citizens.  I organized meetings, get-togethers, and used electronic communication in order to prioritize the concerns of my neighborhood’s constituents and bring those concerns to the table.
As the sponsor of Fruita Monument High School’s Young Democrats Club I helped students coordinate youth election drives as well as sponsor a gubernatorial debate among many of the candidates running in the Democratic Primary for the office of Governor of the State of Colorado in 2018.
In the past I volunteered with Mesa County Libraries to teach English to immigrants.  I am very proud of this work, as it enables people that don’t often have a voice to be able to advocate for themselves.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have been teaching American Government for over twenty years.  During this time I’ve explained the concept of gerrymandering to high school students, and I’ve had to try to somehow clarify that while gerrymandering is illegal, it is hard to avoid and happens frequently.   I was so proud to vote for Colorado’s independent redistricting plan.  I truly believe that we are a state that paves the way for positive change and I don’t doubt that soon many other states will be following our example. 
Also, the residents of downtown Grand Junction have many similar beliefs and goals.  However, the districts in Grand Junction are mapped so that downtown is split into roughly pie shaped regions radiating outward from downtown into more rural areas.  It is frustrating, and I still feel like a local version of a non-partisan redistricting commission would be valuable.  It is my belief that democracy is not served when large groups of people are effectively silenced by intentional dilution. That said,  I began attending City Council meetings and realized that participating in the democratic process can actually yield results and is a way to make one’s voice heard.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
These skills come easily to me, as I am naturally a very empathetic person and a good listener. I also am a teacher and it is imperative that I teach students the skills of fairness, impartiality and consensus-building.  This is all the more important in my high school in Fruita.  We are a microcosm of many rural communities in this country, where students have strong feelings on opposite sides of many issues.  For example, the head of our Young Dems Club came from a conservative Mormon family.  We often held debates with the Young Republicans during lunch so that any student that wanted to could observe.  As a teacher, I encourage students to learn how to use facts to support their positions and then actively listen to the other side.  I am always amazed at how easy it is to find consensus once rhetoric is eliminated.   

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have a Master’s Degree in History and I also teach Advanced Placement United States History.  A key component of success in the field of history is the ability to research and analyze an issue and then logically present evidence to support an argument.  I use and teach these skills every day.  Furthermore, my husband and I have been active in home building and renovating.  We began by constructing an off-grid home miles away from the nearest town.  I quickly had to learn concrete problem-solving skills, as “googling” answers or just running to town was not an option.  I became competent in plumbing, electrical and other building requirements in this way.  Similarly, when we moved to Grand Junction we bought a historic home that was on the verge of being demolished.   We wanted to renovate the home with historic authenticity. Since this skillset is very rare and generally unaffordable, we used our own analysis and problem solving abilities to address a multitude of complex issues over the course of five years. This could not have been achieved without very careful, rational diagnostics.
