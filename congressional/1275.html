  Assefa B Woldu
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>None</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Retired as of January 1, 2020 but worked for U.S. Bank as Operational Manager over 10 years and 25 years altogether.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>

  Masters in Organizational Managements from University of Phoenix in Aurora Colorado
Bachelors degree in Business and Technology from Metropolitan State University in Denver
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80011
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I spent most of my working life in financial institution. I managed different departments, by following polices and procedures of the company, I was able to successfully managed and met the goal of the departments and company by increasing the profitability for investors, stakeholders as well as for employees. As a leader of the departments I was able to successfully organize and communicate between the employees and higher management of the organization. That led a win win situation to both sides, the organization and the employees.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
The only time I have been participating in political activities was in elections. I have been voting to whom I thought will do the job instead of political affiliations. When it comes to donation, I did receive emails and some letters from democratic parties asking for donations, and I was able to donate very little in 2020 but not sure if I did in 2015.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I didn&#39;t participate in any political and Civil organizations but participated in Wello Community in Colorado Association. I was a chairman for the association for over six years. The association was created to support / help, encourage the association members and to stand together during difficult and good times.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Recently, I was introduced to the Colorado Independent Redistricting Commission and became interested in participating to contribute to the community for the good of the state. I am retired as of January 1, 2020 but still able to do more work and would like to use the opportunity to contribute.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I practiced seeing things objectively and based on my analysis and understanding of a situation, I promote consensus. To be fair, I base my decisions on the assessments of the situation and what the outcome will be.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
While working in the bank, I participated in many projects that involved changing, improving and modifying or solving problems. In order to accomplish any of those: research, data analysis or interpretation, looking at different reports, involving other department personnel that could be affected by the change to be made and clear communication with participating parties as what to be done is essential. Problem solving has its own steps: Defining the problem, brainstorming possible solutions, selecting the best possible solution, applying the solution, do follow up and get feedback and if it woks mission accomplished, if not go to the next possible solution and so on. That was how we were getting things accomplished.
