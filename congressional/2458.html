<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In 2016 I joined INDIVISIBLE and marched in several rallies to support Women, Science, Gun Sense Legislation, and Environmental Advocacy.  In 2020 I donated money to campaigns for President and US Senate - Biden, Warnock, Ossoff, Jones, Hegar, Greenfield, Peters, Perkins, Gideon, Bollier, Kelly, Bullock, Gross, Cunningham, Harrison, and Hickenlooper.  I donated to the campaign of Diane Mitsch Bush.  I also donated to the campaign of Yes on the National Popular Vote.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I&#39;ve been involved in my neighborhood association since 2010 - Martin Acres Neighborhood Association (MANA) which provides opportunities to volunteer helping neighbors with a variety of chores.
I volunteered with Vote Forward in 2020 to write letters to registered voters in various states; voters who have a history of not voting in every election.  I urged them to vote in the 2020 election.  I did not ask or urge them to vote for any particular candidate; I just reminded them that voting is our most powerful tool.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My most meaningful experiences in this realm involved meeting with my school administrator and eventually with school district administrators to advocate for students.  In the first instance, I wanted to highlight and solve the problem of students not eating district provided school lunches. Students found the food unappealing and so would not eat.  Students at my school all qualified for free lunches and bringing lunch from home was not an option.  We were able to agree that the district would provide mores food choices for students and this helped solve the problem.  In the second instance, I was able to advocate for more thorough and consistent cleaning of classrooms by providing scientific evidence that surfaces in classrooms were contaminated with bacteria.  In both cases students&#39; health was the motivation.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The results of the 2020 census will inform us about population growth necessitating changes to our congressional and legislative district boundaries.  As the thoughtful voters of Colorado decided that this work should be done by an independent commission, it would be an tremendous honor to serve them as part of the teams working to create these new district maps.  I imagine that the work will be challenging while also providing an opportunity to learn more about the workings of our democracy and I find that quite appealing.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Working with a team is energizing, challenging, fulfilling, and a huge opportunity to learn.  I have no agenda with regard to the commission other than working with others to create a document that provides the most equitable layout of districts for the future of voting/representation in our state.  
I am a calm but enthusiastic advocate of civility and good listening.  I like to think that I have some skill at asking good questions.  These qualities are essential for promoting consensus and agreement in most working-group settings.
With a background in both teaching and in science my tendency is to be both fair and impartial.  My experience is that there is much work to be done before conclusions can be drawn.  Gathering information/data led to good decision making during both of my careers.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
After graduating with a degree in molecular biology I worked as research assistant at CU for 6 years until my first child was born.  It was a job that required gathering, organizing, and analyzing data.  Keeping meticulous notes became second nature.  The necessity to problem solve was a daily occurrence and often required group solutions thereby making good communication essential.  10 years later when I was diagnosed with cancer I used these same methods to research and decide on the best treatment options. These methods and skills still inform my approach to life.
