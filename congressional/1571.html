        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Stacey Lynn McSkimin</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Stacey Lynn McSkimin
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Stacey Lynn Morley (maiden name, married 2002)</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently employed as a Social Studies Teacher at D&#39;Evelyn Senior High School in Jefferson County. I teach both sophomores and seniors. The classes I teach are AP US Government, AP Macroeconomics, US Government, Economics, and History of Western Civilization.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I earned a B.S. in Secondary Social Studies Education from Ohio University in 2001. In 2008, I completed a Masters of Arts in History degree from the University of Colorado Denver as a James Madison Fellow. I studied early American history,  European intellectual history of the modern period and modern America history with a focus on the U.S. Constitution.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80126
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I am the mother of twin daughters and I have worked full time since they were born. This has not left me a good deal of time up to this point to volunteer in my community. That said, I have previously volunteered and canvased for school board elections and bond/mill issues as both a teacher in Jefferson County and a parent and tax payer in Douglas County. I have many connections with fellow community members on a personal level where we discuss contemporary political issues and policy questions and it has always been my goal to become active in this space once my children were old enough that I could devote time and energy to my endeavors. I have been a Social Studies teacher for nearly two decades and specifically a Government teacher for seniors in high school for seven. Professionally, I am well educated and read in the area of government systems and structures as well as linkage institutions that connect citizens with our government and I would gratefully welcome the opportunity to apply these skills to this commission as well as to take what I observe and learn about the process and instill this knowledge into my students for years to come.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I do not recall making a donation to a political campaign, party, or interest group in recent years, though five years is a long time. If I did, it would have been less than $50 as I&#39;ve never given more than that to a candidate, party or group. I do belong to a couple of left leaning interest groups such as Sandy Hook promise and was formerly a member of the Jefferson County Education Association which is a subgroup of the NEA. I left the union around 2010, but I cannot remember the exact date. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I mentioned the JCEA above; however, I do not think I have actively been a member since 2015 though they do negotiate my contract as a member of the faculty in JeffCo public schools. I am a Madison Fellow and below to their alumni group and I live in Highlands Ranch so I am a member of the HOA but only as a homeowner, not in any position either appointed or elected. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I deeply believe in our system of government and the need for an educated, informed and engaged electorate as foundational to it&#39;s success. My career is a testament to this deeply held belief. I think I could both meaningfully contribute to this process because I have a good deal of experience both in understanding the implications of districting but also in working in collaborative teams who are facing difficult and contentious decisions. I also am skilled at weighing evidence, seeking evidence based decisions, and building consensus. Finally, I truly have demonstrated my great desire to work in service of citizens and my community. My daily work is in developing informed and engaged citizens. I will take what I learn about this process first hand and be sure to share and apply it with my students and community. I will most certainly learn from this process and I have the ability to amplify my knowledge with the broader community and build efficacy and awareness of this process.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have spent nearly twenty years as a Social Studies educator. I have taught in a variety of communities over my career, including in Cleveland public schools, Alameda International and D&#39;Evelyn in Jefferson County. Over the course of my career, I have served in many teacher leadership roles and have been quite successful in both advocating for and building consensus around ideas. As a government and history teacher, it is critical that I present factually driven, unbias or equally representative lessons and I have always been successful in this. I have a long and distinguished track record of presenting clear, accurate, and fair lessons in my classroom. Last year, I was even awarded with the Teacher of the Year honor by our graduating class which I believe speaks to my impartiality and fairness in a position of knowledge and trust in my community.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I teach political science, economics and history. I hold advanced degrees in History. All of these disciplines require deeply analytical work and I have demonstrated competence and mastery in them. I work in teams and lead classrooms of young adults daily, delivering and mentoring logic and reason in a wide variety of areas. I believe the vocational strength of liberal arts and social science is the development of skills in logic and reason and for this reason I feel my academic and vocational background would well situate me in this are.
