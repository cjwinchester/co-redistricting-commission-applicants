        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Robin F Schepper</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Robin F Schepper
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Communications consultant, have various clients including Routt County
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Bachelors Degree in Language Studies
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80487
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I worked for two years to advocate for a school bond in Steamboat Springs meeting many community groups in the area.  I now work for Routt County providing information on COVID-19.  
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have worked on presidential campaigns in 1988, 1992, 1996 and 2000.  I worked in the Clinton Administration and Obama Administration from 2010-2011.  I donated to Gail Schwartz for Congress, Diane Mitsch Busch, Biden-Harris, Harris for President, Yang for President.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Since 2015 -- I am a board member of Routt County United Way, Routt County Integrated Community, Chair of the Steamboat Springs High School Parent Information Committee, Community Committee for Education (CC4E). 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I care deeply about fairness and representation of all voters. I am extremely interested in serving on the Commission. Community service is extremely important to me. I have always served my community in some capacity wherever I have lived.  As a child and grandchild of immigrants, I have always felt it is my duty to contribute to democratic establishments in the United States.  Serving on the Commission would give me an opportunity to represent the interests of rural Western Colorado and at the same time different constituencies that are important to the vibrance of Colorado â€“ ranchers, small businesses, tourist economies, the ski industry, parents and schools.  I feel my voice will be valuable to the Commission because I am a good listener, I have intellectual curiosity to learn more and I am fair and polite when working with others who do not share my values.  I did not learn English until I went to kindergarten and I am the first person in my family to attend college. I have lived in cities and now in a rural area.  I am the mother of two adopted children from Kazakhstan and I now consult for my home county on COVID-19 response.  All these diverse experiences will allow me to help the process of creating fair maps, which are instrumental for future voting and representation at the federal and legislative level.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Throughout my career, I have had to build consensus and agreement.  I have found that setting clear expectations is the first step in building consensus.  In addition, using techniques like developing SMART (specific, measurable, actionable, realistic and timebound) goals helps focus teams on what we are trying to achieve instead of personalities, tactics or disagreements. I have numerous examples of practicing empathy and collaborating with others with different opinions.  From 2000-2004, I worked in Greece for the Athens Olympic Organizing Committee setting up the International Media office and supervising media strategy and operations.  Aside from working in an environment where I was usually the only women at senior staff meetings, I managed many Greek staff with very different levels of experience and understanding of how to work in an international environment.  My way of working with them was to always be direct, honest, share information and focus on the ultimate goals.  Along the way, I taught them as many skills as I could on how to handle top level sports reporters from around the world. One of my most enduring legacies is the number of Greek staff that now serve in leadership positions in Greece, England, and Australia and how they credit me with giving them the foundation to working on teams and at a high level of expectations.  In addition, locally in Steamboat Springs, I worked on the Community Committee for Education (CC4E) which was created after a failed bond initiative. Our diverse committee spanned many different perspectives from old time rancher/bankers to restaurant owners to mothers who volunteered in the schools.  We did not come from the same perspectives, but I believe my leadership and communications skills led to a strong proposal that was presented to and supported by 28 community groups in Steamboat Springs.  Even when discussions were heated, I was always open to suggestions and ways that we could move forward as a committee.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Throughout my professional career, I have had to use my analytical and critical thinking skills in a variety of situations.  I am skilled in strategic communications, coalition building and partnerships, change management, influencing public policy, training, and coaching leaders and staff to reach their optimal potential. I have developed strategic plans for non-profits and government programs like First Lady Michelle Obamaâ€™s Letâ€™s Move initiative and the Department of Defenseâ€™s Healthy Base Initiative to improve nutrition and increase physical activity at military installations.  I have collaborated with many types of constituencies. For example, although I never served in the military, I worked with leaders at the Pentagon and local military installations in the U.S. to improve nutritional options.  Speaking three languages has also attuned me to listen and gather information about different cultures.  I am comfortable researching different issues, brainstorming, collaborating, developing budgets, analyzing options and communicating with different types of audiences.
