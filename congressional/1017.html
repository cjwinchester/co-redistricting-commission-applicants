<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I can think of a lot of things as an answer to this question, but I would like to focus on my experience advocating, organizing and representing, as a member and acting as the Vice-Chairman of Morgan County Democrats in Colorado. 

When I moved to Fort Morgan, Colorado a few years ago, I found that the Democratic Party was a minority in the community.  Most residents of Fort Morgan belonged to the Republican Party.  As a result, the Democrats felt oppressed. As a leader, I found that this made it difficult for me to get things done.  

Just to place a sign out in the street was risky for fear that the signs would be vandalized. And it did happen. The signs that we placed on the street were immediately vandalized several times.  

Few people wanted to work with us because we were Democrats.  It was difficult to just locate a venue to host an event in the community.  To rent an office to hold our monthly meeting was an enormous task because organizations refused to rent to us.  

Organizing a float in the 4th of July in order to be visible in the community was unheard of.  Few members of the Morgan County Democrats wanted to even ride in the parade for fear of not only ridicule, but the possible physical harm that may come to them. Few wanted to take these risks. The first time we constructed a float, decorated it with huge banners with huge letters of MORGAN COUNTY DEMOCRATS and rode on it in the 4th of July parade, some people ran out in the streets and threw objects at us. Children sprayed water directly on us. But we survived it.  Those people in the audience, who had secretly claimed to be Democrats, were initially apprehensive to cheer and clap for us.  But I noticed that they slowly came around over the years. Each year they saw our Party in the parade, more of them came out to cheer, voicing their appreciation.  

Losing a job was a concern for the members of our organization. They did not want to deal with the repercussions of being revealed that they supported the Democratic Party at their workplace.  I experienced this myself.  I kept a low profile at work.  In this way I identified with the members’ oppressed feelings.  Some must have lost their jobs before I came on the scene.  

Election time seemed to be a stressful time.  Door-knocking was an insurmountable task. No one dared to knock on doors the first year I came to Fort Morgan.   I personally, alone, had to go knock on doors to get the vote out.  Gradually over the years, I got a few more people to muster enough courage to knock on doors with me.  What helped were the stories I wrote up about my experiences knocking on doors and I emailed these to the members of the Democratic Party in the county.  Slowly, more and more people became willing to knock on doors with me. 

With this backdrop of the circumstances, I felt that I had to advocate for who I am and on behalf of my party, not only to the community of Fort Morgan, but to the members themselves in the monthly meetings.  There was tremendous discrimination and prejudice against the Democrats in Morgan County. Everything that we valued as a party, like gay rights, women’s right to choose, immigration rights, labor rights, environmental protection values, was held against us.  

Therefore, it took a lot of courage, determination, persistence, and the energy to change the minds of the people.  This I experienced while I organized and represented the Democrats and advocated for them in their community as well as within their own party.

<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Most of my past political activity has been with the Morgan County Democratic Party.  I led the way to knocking on doors for the Hillary Clinton campaign.  I made calls to voters.  I spent all day on election day contacting those voters who had not yet voted and following up on those who had not responded by visiting their homes in order to make sure that every voter had voted.  I would like to think that due to my efforts, I have contributed to the victory of Hillary Clinton in the state of Colorado.  

Before the Hillary Clinton elections, I helped Barack Obama win Colorado.  I was fortunate to win the Northeastern CO campaign for the volunteer who had gone the extra mile of knocking on doors and calling on voters.  The winner would have his picture taken with Vice President Joe Biden.  I was so excited to meet and pose in a photo with VP Joe Biden. 

I have been very active with the Morgan County Democratic Party ever since I came to Fort Morgan 14 years ago.  I volunteered to head committees to organize dinners, like our annual Big-Ten dinner, as well as the fall and Christmas dinners.  The task of organizing and planning involved a wide range of tasks.  We had to find a proper venue equipped with a kitchen and a facility to hold enough people for the event.  If the event was a potluck dinner, we had to make sure people brought enough food.   We had to come up with a theme and design an agenda.  We had to solicit help to decorate the venue and clean up the location.  Places that had no sound system was an extra task to find someone to provide a sound system.  Providing entertainment for the dinner involved the task of soliciting musical groups to perform at the event.  In order to run an event according to schedule, it was important to follow up with the speakers and presenters to make sure they had all the information they needed so they could arrive on time.  Finally, one of the most important part of organizing an event was to plan a fund-raising project, like an auction during the dinner, that would be lucrative for the Party. 

Community exposure was one of my objectives as a leader.  I wanted the public to know who we were and what we stood for.  I wanted to make the public feel welcome to our center.  With that in mind, I reached out by introducing myself and the Party whenever events came about in the community.  I made small presentations about our monthly meetings, our frequent get-togethers including dinners and parties and made the public feel at ease with us and helped them realize that we had a lot of positive things to offer.  

I donated $35 dollar every year for the Big-Ten dinners since 2015.  I also donated $30 each to 3 candidates since that time.

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Throughout the summer of 2020, I volunteered by phone and internet for the Navajo Hopi Covid-19 Relief Fund, reaching out to those native people who were affected by Coronavirus. Many lived in the remote areas of the Navajo and Hopi reservations without running water or electricity. A toll-free telephone number was set up where members of their families could call and reach a virtual volunteer, like myself, who took a list of needs like food, water, medical, transportation and cleaning supplies and passed this list on to the ground volunteers who supplied these needs. This was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.  

Since 2015, I have also volunteered for other events like the Thanksgiving dinner for the homeless at the Rise Up Center through the Community of Christ church.

I have participated in the weekly bible study through the Lutheran Church of Our Redeemer.
I have also participated in a different bi-weekly men’s bible study in the Fort Morgan community which included various religious groups.

In 2019, I marched with in annual gay pride parade with Xcel Energy Company.  
Since 2015, I have also volunteered with Xcel Energy to clean up the Barr Lake State Park in Brighton, CO. 

Please note that other organizations that I have volunteered for, or was a member of, prior to 2015, are as follows:

Customer Service Trainer for 3 years at Colorado Plains Medical Center.
Medical Interpreter at Colorado Plains Medical Center.
Volunteered for and sponsored the annual golf tournament by the Fort Morgan Community Hospital Association for 4 years.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Ever since I researched the subject of redistricting and read a book about it, I became aware how important it is that every American’s vote is counted. I have found that one way to disenfranchise a voter’s right to be equally represented is through the unfair drawing of lines along the districts on a map. Example: if you have knowledge of where the minority population resides on a map and you want to keep them from winning the election, you can exert your power by redrawing the lines in a way to keep the minority from winning an election, thereby disenfranchising their right to have their voice heard.

This is what drives me to serve on the commission.  I am a Navajo Indian; I am unique and come from a population that is underserved and underrepresented.  I believe that my input from a diverse perspective is valuable because I would like to make sure people of my race and other minority population have an equal voice through fair mapping.   

My experiences in the community as Vice President of Morgan County Democrats and my background of volunteer work only enhance my drive to serve to make a difference as a member of the redistricting commission.

<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As president of a Native American organization, I had a rare opportunity to lead a people that came from two diverse religious beliefs.  One group was of the Christian faith and this group consisted of urban Indians coming from the city lifestyle.  The other group was of the traditional Native American religion which came in from the reservation areas.   I was tempted to cater to one group which had similar beliefs to mine.  But I had to overlook my established way of thinking and become empathetic to those who believed differently than me.  I also noticed that it was easy for one group to turn against the other because they felt, albeit unsubstantiated, there was favoritism demonstrated against them. An example of the diverse of beliefs was how they felt about gay members of the group.  The Christians did not feel that assistance should easily be given to the gay members of the group while the traditional natives had more compassion and respect for the gay members. Though it was a challenge, I had to be fair and impartial. I brought these groups together by promoting consensus by first allowing the members to introduce themselves and to share something unique about themselves.  An important characteristic about the gay members was that they were very artistic.  Most had a talent to perform or to decorate.  This came in very handy when we decided to build a float for an annual parade that had a historical significance to the Native American community.  Our float was featured on television because we brought Native American dancers together to perform on the float.  The Native American motif and design was unique and outstanding.  What resulted from this event was the new respect the gay members gained.  There was a better understanding between the groups and a respect for their diverse uniqueness of the members.  The conservative group became more empathetic to the gay group as well as the traditional native group.  They all started to get along and a much better cohesiveness was created.  As a result, the ability to collaborate on new projects were more easily achieved.

From experiences like this, I feel that I can contribute to the redistricting commission by listening to the different perspectives and points of view, thereby be impartial and  promote consensus among the commissioners.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Most of my professional career in mortgage lending over a time span of 20 years involved not just creative analytical skills, but also critical thinking, communication, and research skills.   

When a borrower comes to me for financing, I am required to use all these skills to determine if the borrower will be capable of repaying the money he hopes to obtain.  As the loan officer or mortgage broker, I am the first gatekeeper towards the borrower’s path to obtaining a loan. After analyzing the borrower’s liabilities and assets, I have a duty to make a wise judgment as to whether the loan will close.  This involves gathering data to reveal the picture of the borrower.  I am obligated to input the data accurately into my calculations and verify that the borrower has sufficient income, stable job history, and sufficient reserves to sustain the monthly payment.  I have to determine whether the borrower has the appropriate debt ratio, which is the amount of debt analyzed against the income.  Investigating, verifying, and checking for accuracy are all part of forming the true picture of the borrower. If there are blemishes in the credit history of the borrower, I have the responsibility to determine how the negative credit will impact the borrower’s ability to repay the loan.  Here, my ability to communicate is essential; I am required to draw the information from the borrower to determine if the bad credit is due to consistent negligence or a one-time event that was beyond the control of the borrower. 

When the case is extremely difficult, I am forced to collaborate with my fellow-loan officers and supervisor to see if the deal is too risky or if we can creatively do the financing. An example is if the property falls within a fine-line definition of real property. Real property is one that is affixed to land.  As a mortgage lender, the only properties I can finance are those that fall within this definition of real property. A questionable type of this property is a modular home which used to be a movable property but has since been transformed into a property that would be attached to land. The investors who ultimately put up the money to finance the deal may bring up this question at the last minute of closing and the property could be rejected. A good loan officer has this foresight and avoids this probability beforehand.  

Being at the forefront where everything hinges on how well I reveal the true picture of the borrower is the essential part of whether the investor will profit or lose money on the deal of financing a borrower’s request.  How well I have used my analytical skills and how well I have applied my logic and reasoning to solve the initial problems involved in approving a loan will determine the end result of the investment.
