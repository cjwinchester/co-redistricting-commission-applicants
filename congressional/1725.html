        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Antonio Luis Vazquez</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Antonio Luis Vazquez
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Antonio Vazquez</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Civil Design Engineer at Marcin Engineering LLC
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I went to Douglas County High School in Castle Rock. For my first year of college, I attended the University of Oklahoma to pursue a meteorology degree. However, I moved back to Colorado and completed the bulk and last 3 years of my college education at the University of Colorado Boulder for a bachelor of science in civil engineering. 

Throughout the beginning of my career as a civil engineer, I have studied off-and-on in preparation for the professional engineering exam, which I just took on October 23rd. If I pass, I will be a licensed professional engineer and will have the ability to approve civil engineering designs under my name. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80461
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I have attended peaceful protest gatherings advocating for the Black Lives Matter movement in Leadville and Breckenridge. I have also attended a peaceful protest march in Denver advocating for believing in climate science and pushing legislation to reduce climate change. My experiences in these matters have been rather informal in nature.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
During the 2016 primary season, I served as a precinct captain for my voting precinct in Eagle County. I took charge of running my precinct&#39;s caucus and reporting our votes to the local Democratic Party official during the caucus event. Afterward, I served as a delegate for Bernie Sanders during the first round of voting in Eagle. I also volunteered for phonebanking twice during the 2016 primary season for Bernie Sanders, calling registered voters throughout the area. I also drove to Laramie, WY one weekend to walk the streets and knock on doors to get the vote out for Bernie Sanders prior to their caucus.

In 2020, now living in Leadville, I joined a group of locals for peaceful protest gatherings on Sunday afternoons in front of the county building on Harrison Avenue. We held signs in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and other progressive causes as cars drove by, whose passengers and drivers mostly delivered honks, cheers, and smiles. 

In 2016, I donated to the Bernie Sanders campaign and again in 2020. Also in 2020, I donated money to Diane Mitsch Bush&#39;s campaign to be District 3&#39;s Congresswoman. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
In 2016, I briefly served as the precinct captain for my voting precinct in Eagle-Vail in Eagle County. In 2020, I am part of One Leadville, which is a group of Leadville locals who advocate for transparent and fair governance and law enforcement in Leadville and Lake County.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I wish to serve on the commission because I have always had a vested interest in Colorado politics and politics in general. Although I&#39;m sure it&#39;s become apparent that I am what you would describe as a progressive liberal, I also consider myself a realist. I believe in fair, equitable elections, and I voted in favor of the ballot measures that created the position I&#39;m now applying for. I believe our current congressional districts are fair, but as a resident of the 3rd District, I do believe they could be drawn a little better. For example, the 3rd District is widely considered to be the &quot;Western Slope&quot; district, but it leaves out a chunk of Eagle County, which is Western Slope by definition. The Western Slope alone doesn&#39;t have enough population to have its own district, so it was drawn eastward which makes sense. However, non-Western Slope areas were added (such as Lake County, San Luis Valley, etc.) before finishing out the Western Slope in Eagle County. I&#39;m sure there are reasons for this, but it&#39;s something I&#39;ve noticed, and I&#39;d like to bring my own objective perspectives to the table, considering I have gained an extensive knowledge of Colorado geography and politics. I have always been interested in both of these things, and that is why I want to serve on the commission. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I know the nuances of Colorado geography and politics, and I believe these two together create a good foundation on which to build consensus regarding congressional districts. I love brainstorming ideas and coming up with alternatives, and this will help as well. As a people-pleaser, I&#39;m confident in my ability to foster agreement between parties. The realist in me also helps to be fair and impartial. I know biases when I see them, which is why I seek out neutral news sources and take information from media outlets which are known to have a leftward slant with a grain of salt. As a left-leaning person, I believe it&#39;s important to recognize these things and approach issues with a neutral point of view. I will carry this mindset with me into my duties as a commissioner, should I be chosen. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As an engineer, I approach most things in my life with logic and an analytical mindset. My day-to-day work involves applying these things to not only the projects I work on, but my relationships with my coworkers. To throw in a personal anecdote, my partner would probably laugh at this prompt and say I&#39;m even &quot;too logical&quot; for the job. I&#39;ve always considered myself a realist and prefer to see things objectively. Through my efforts in analyzing issues, solutions can be brought up through reason. To be honest, I&#39;m having a little difficulty explaining myself well in responding to this prompt, but I hope I have done so sufficiently. When I think about exactly how I apply logic and reason to the things in my life, I&#39;m not sure how to explain how I do; I just do.
