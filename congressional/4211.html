<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My political activity consists mostly of staying informed and engaging in conversation with others who are interested in politics.  Frequently display yard signs during campaign season.  Have worked on behalf of the Republican party to distribute literature in my neighborhood, especially during the 2010 general election.  Volunteered for the Casper Stockham campaign in 2020 but didn&#39;t actually do much.  Worked to gather signatures in 2018 to get the issue of the national popular vote on the ballot.

Have donated to the following:
National Republican Senate Committee
Casper Stockham campaign
Greg Lopez for governor
Take Back Colorado
Durkin for DA
Cory Gardner for Senate
WinRed
Senate Conservative Fund
Due Date Too Late
Trump Make America Great Again committee
Laurel Imer campaign
Stand for America
Joe Collins for Congress

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
N/A
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As mentioned above, I worked as a petition signature gatherer to get the issue regarding the National Popular Vote on the 2020 ballot after the Colorado legislature voted to assign Colorado&#39;s electoral votes to the recipient of the national popular vote in presidential elections, an obviously unconstitutional effort by the left to abolish the Electoral College.

Consistently advocate for conservative issues and groups on social media, personal interactions, and blogs.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have felt for many years that the districting process was a blatant exercise by both major political parties to manipulate the populace rather than a thoughtful, reasonable, or sensible method of accomplishing an extremely important part of our democratic right of self-governance.  Watching the methods used and the results that came out of this process made me often think to myself, &quot;If it were up to me, I would . . . &quot;  Now I am hoping that maybe I will at last get the chance to speak up in a way that may actually have an effect on this process.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I don&#39;t know how much average common sense adds to promoting consensus or creating agreement, but I believe I have plenty of common sense to apply to this issue.  I am not bombastic or angry, but I do have passion for doing what I believe is the right thing in the right way, even if it doesn&#39;t necessarily benefit me personally.  I have watched in dismay as too many people consider only one side of an issue and rationalize and justify their behavior due to how it affects just their own personal situation, rather than how it will affect the community, state, and country as a whole in the long run.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I think a lot.  Sometimes I think I think too much.  But I do attempt to study issues and think about what I believe and why, and I often play the &quot;substitution game&quot; in which I consider how I would view things from the other side.  I try to look beyond the rhetoric and empty words that are often used in marketing different ideas and policies and consider what the actual results of these ideas and policies would be in real life, affecting real people.  I consider how decisions made today will affect the citizens of tomorrow, i.e., will the long-term results be positive or negative for the overall health and prosperity and morality of the citizens in 10, 20, 50 years?  Though it is impossible for anyone to accurately predict the future, I believe that we need to use the knowledge and wisdom we have gained from our experience to attempt to make wise decisions in the present.  Wisdom is rarely seen these days, unfortunately.  Likewise with statesmanship.  People seem to focus on themselves in the here and now more than the long-term consequences that may occur as a result of their words, actions, and decisions of today.  We have ignored the adage that tells us that if we forget history, we are doomed to repeat it.  History CANNOT be erased, but there is a lot we can learn from it.  That seems logical and reasonable to me.
