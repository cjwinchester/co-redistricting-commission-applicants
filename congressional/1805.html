<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I received my BA in Anthropology in 2007 from St. Lawrence University, in Canton, NY. I earned my Master&#39;s degree in 2012 in Environmental Leadership from Naropa University. 

During my graduate studies, the curriculum included leadership skills such as community development, consensus building, and engaging all interested parties on an issue. 

</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80031
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am actively engaged with Good Business Colorado, an non-profit advocacy group working towards building a prosperous economy, equitable communities, and a sustainable environment. Through this group, I have attended several learning sessions regarding bills in the state house or senate and weighed in with questions and feedback on how something would affect my business. See their attached letter of recommendation for more information about this involvement. 

This past year, I publicly endorsed Prop 118 as a small business owner, and had an Op-Ed published in the Summit Times supporting the proposition.

I have not donated money to any campaigns or political organizations since November 10, 2015.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Through my business, I am a member of both Good Business Colorado and the Associated Landscaping Contractors of Colorado. See attached letter of recommendation from Good Business Colorado.

As an individual, I am an involved with the following groups:
Active volunteer for the Rocky Mountain MicroFinance Institute, which focuses on launching businesses to increase class mobility
Active volunteer for Cottonwood Institute, which empowers youth to make change in their communities
Active member of the Pledgettes, a women’s finance group devoted to educating eliminating the wage gap

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As the owner of a seasonal landscaping business, I have frequently advocated for seasonal employees and gig workers to be included in policy conversations. Many policies that affect employers and employees are based on year-round businesses, and Colorado’s strong reliance on the tourism industry means that many of our small businesses are seasonal.

Through my landscaping company, I often work with Homeowners Associations to assist with communication between homeowners and the board. There are often exremely disparate opinions involved in an HOA, and as a contractor, ensuring that I’m meeting the needs of the board while providing a good service to my client can be tricky. In other circumstances, I’m working with the board to provide good information to their constituents to set a large project up for success.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Access to fair and impartial voting is a fundamental part of any democracy. One of the toughest parts of voting is the feeling among many of my peers that voting doesn’t matter, and that their vote won’t count. Helping ensure that the districts accurately represent a population removes a barrier to that mentality, and increases the likelihood of residents participating in their local elections. In addition, younger voices are often underrepresented in the decision making process. As a person in my 30s, I can help bridge that gap.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Over the course of my life, I have lived in rural and urban areas, and in conservative and progressive. My experiences have taught me to listen to what someone is saying before making a judgement, and to look for common ground even when it’s hard to find. In the case of this commission, I’m starting with the base assumption that we’re all looking for fairness. If we’re all working towards the same goal, it becomes much easier to talk about the pros and cons of a specific path to get there. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Much of my professional experience has required me to achieve goals while working with disparate populations. Working in education, and now as a small business owner, logic and reason have been invaluable tools to determine where to best leverage my resources. I have had to make hard financial decisions as a business owner, particularly this year during the covid pandemic. Creating a clear plan based on facts allowed me to weather the COVID restrictions this season without laying off employees or cutting salaries.
