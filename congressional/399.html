<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>

Served as a precinct committee person and chairman for Otero County Democrat Party.  Served as Secretary and Chairman for 3rd Congressional Committee.  Elected to Colorado State Senate four times (1983-1998).  Served on the Colorado Joint Budget Committee for twelve years (1987-1998). Appointed by Governor Bill Owens (1999) and confirmed by the Colorado State Senate to serve as a cabinet member to the governor as Director of Health Care Policy and Finance Department. Appointed by President Barak Obama as the Federal Representative/Chairman of the Colorado/Kansas Arkansas River Compact. Served on a number of state task forces over the years including: Task Force on Reorganization of Community Colleges (appointed by Governor Bill Owens), Task Force on Connect Colorado (appointed by Governor Bill Owens), Task Force on Economic Development and Small Business (appointed by Governor Bill Ritter), and Governor Elect John Hickenlooper&#39;s Transition Team.
Since November 10, 2015 I attended fund raisers for both democrat and republican candidates for local offices. I also attended and donated to both the Otero County Democrat and Republican Parties (these donations were through attendance at Jefferson/Jackson and Lincoln dinners/auctions.  Until this year I had not donated to any state-wide or national candidate.  This year (2020) I donated to the Joe Biden for President Committee and the Lincoln Project.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have not belonged to any political organizations since 2015 as an active member. Civic and Community organizations include: La Junta Nursing Home Task Force, Southern Colorado Foundation Board, SEBREA (Southern Colorado Business Retention, Expansion, and Addition) Board, The Colorado/Kansas Arkansas River Compact Commission (appointed by President Barak Obama), President&#39;s Council for the Colorado Community College System, Task Force for the conversion of Fort Lyon Correctional Facility to a facility for the care of Colorado Homeless, and a Board member of the Koshare Indian Museum/Dancers Organization.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I represented ten counties in southern Colorado as a State Senator for sixteen years. During that time I introduced and was prime sponsor of over 323 pieces of legislation. Legislation included: Rural/Urban Economic Development, Enterprise Zones, Medicaid reform, Reorganization of Health Care/Human Services in Colorado, Water Rights, Agriculture Expansion, Reorganization of Higher Education, Juvenile Detention Reform, School Finance (K-12), Siting of State Prisons and Expansion of Private Prisons in the State, Preservation of Rail System from Western Slope to the Kansas Border, Workers Compensation Reform, Rural Health Care Expansion, and development of twelve state budgets as a member of the Joint Budget Committee. In all of these endeavors I met with all interest groups to listen to their views so as to eventually move toward developing a consensus so as to pass the legislation and/or budget. I met with individuals and organizations from throughout the state of Colorado thus getting to know the concerns or issues of urban, rural, western slope, eastern slope, northern and southern Colorado.
As a member of Governor Bill Owens cabinet (Director of Health Care Policy and Finance) I would be responsible for meeting with and bringing together different health care organizations (Hospital, Rural Health Care, Nursing Homes, Disability Community etc.) so as to propose legislation, develop rules and regulations and propose a budget to meet the needs of the health care community (both providers and users) while at the same time ensuring that a balanced budget was being proposed. To ensure input from throughout the state I initiated the policy of holding the Medicaid Board meetings throughout the state of Colorado rather than just holding the meetings in Denver. Thus giving individuals, organizations
and constituency groups better access and input into the Medicaid Boards develop of rules and regulations.
I was asked by the President and State Board for the Colorado Community College System to be on a task force to meet with community members in Northwest Colorado to help reorganize and draft a plan to ensure the viability of Northwest Community College in Rangely/Craig Colorado. As a member of the task force we met with different constituency groups and I was tasked to develop and write the proposed plan taking into consideration concerns and issues brought forward by community members. Through consensus we were able to develop a plan which was ultimately adopted by the Community College System.
I was asked in 2006 while serving as President of Otero Junior College to become the joint president of both Otero Jr. College and Lamar Community College.  In the two and one half years that I served in this position I met with all constituency groups in the Lamar Community College area so as to gain trust, determine what the issues were and in turn developed a plan to make Lamar Community College financially solvent with adequate reserves to move forward. This was one of the most challenging positions I have held in that there is always competition between higher educational institutions and concern of a larger college (Otero Jr. College in this case) taking over a smaller college. By working with the people at the college and community I was able to develop their support and trust and after the two and one half years Lamar Community College was able to move forward and hire their own President.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I would like to serve on the commission in that over the years I have seen how politics and individual interests have driven decisions in how congressional districts were drawn. Often times without caring about ensuring communities of interest and the meeting the desires and needs of the people being served.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I feel in every position I have held I have been able to gain the trust of people I have worked with. I have approached every endeavor whether it be legislative, business, community etc. in a bi-partisan manner. My philosophy has always been to solve a problem at hand rather than getting caught up in politics. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I feel I have a great understanding of all areas of the state. I understand the differences in the demographic areas of the state and through my experiences have shown that I am very detailed, a consensus builder, and a person who is willing to take the time to listen to all sides of an issue and in turn seek to come up with logical and bi-partisan approaches to issues rather than expedient political solutions.
