<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
When my daughter was in kindergarten, she wanted to be a Girl Scout, but there was no leader to start a troop, so I stepped up, out of my comfort level to be the troop leader. I spent the next seven years recruiting girls, convincing their parents to enroll them and helping to prepare them for their futures. I have presented the program to parents many times over the years and some have been resistant, however I discovered that I can be an effective advocate for the things I believe in.

Since then, I have been a vocal supporter of many causes. My success has been largely due to the fact that I have an analytical mind and can listen to and understand the needs on all sides. Once I know what&#39;s truly at stake, it&#39;s much easier to find common solutions.

When Dean Foods purchased the family business I worked for and moved our operations to Meadow Gold Dairy, I negotiated a deal with Dean Foods to allow Robinson to have a huge farewell party at our plant; they were reluctant for a variety of reasons (some employees would be let of their shifts, liabilities etc) but I was able to address all their concerns and they relented. It was an important event for both past and current employees to be able to say goodby, and Dean Foods actually ended up contributing to the cost.

When I started consulting for Consolidated Services, the small business was in chaos, our sole client was unhappy with our performance, management were all doing their own thing, supervisors had no experience or training and the employees were out of control. I studied the contract, meet with everyone I could and listened. I felt like I was in over my head; I had never experienced anything like this before, but I persevered and slowly things began to improve. I began weekly supervisor trainings, adjusted schedules to better fit the needs of employees, convinced our clients and employees to have regular interactions to improve relations, helped to reduce racial tensions that were building, insisted on regular meetings for all staff, better pay and a rewards program for motivation. I helped to establish our own identity and pursue additional clients. The organization, as it stands now is a much better place to work and our clients are no longer dissatisfied.

As a volunteer with New Era, I got to talk to many people about the Democratic process. We worked various events and had booths set up at the college campuses. It was so easy to discuss with folks of all stripes because encouraging people to make sure their voices are heard is a non-partisan issue. At Auraria, we saw many of the same people over and over; students, primarily who felt disaffected, that voting was futile and they didn&#39;t want to get their hopes up. When somebody finally registers after months of attempts, it is such a beautiful thing, it brings tears to my eyes right now to just think about it.

At Grounds Services, I was able to successfully receive payments that had been unjustly held by a client as well as to help broker a deal to get our employees certified at the last minute when the client changed requirements at the last minute.

Not to mention my experience as a mother and grandmother constantly settling disputes, keeping the peace and ensuring harmony on the household.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
In addition to all the reasons listed previously, which speak to my passion for justice and access to democracy, I am a fierce advocate for future generations.

When I was a young adult, I felt betrayed by the baby-boomers. After joining the workforce, it appeared that they forgot about all the causes they cared about. They stopped talking about then anyway. When I was a kid, many subjects were openly discussed, and often disagreed upon. When I became an adult, controversial subjects were no longer on the table, we weren&#39;t allowed to talk about them because somebody might get upset. While it is true that some people have a difficult time listening to others and being respectful when discussing a topic they care about, that is not always the case. When we can take a breath and listen openly to another viewpoint it helps us understand one another better, even if we still disagree. When I was young, there were discussions about many difficult topics being modeled in our communities, governments and entertainments, but by the time I grew up, there was a stigma associated with it, therefore we collectively forget how to listen, how to be respectful and how to appreciate our differences.

I believe I can objectively evaluate the census data and other inputs, actively and openly listen to the opinions of other commissioners as well as public and legal requirements in order to draw the most accurately representative districts possible. I believe it&#39;s important for the commission to be a diverse body, and believe that as a woman and someone who has worked closely with disenfranchised groups, that I can bring a fresh perspective to the commission.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am a good listener, which I believe is an underappreciated and often unused essential life skill. I can suspend my personal agendas, beliefs and desires temporarily in order to hear what is being said at the moment. I truly want to understand where other people are coming from and where they want to go.

In my professional life, I have had much experience both advocating on behalf of my employees and explaining to them why they must do certain things or behave in certain ways in order to thrive at work. I have stood my ground in the face of potential loss to myself, but I have also changed my mind when there has been sufficient reason to do so.

Several years ago, I served on a jury, which was a fascinating experience. Each and every one of us came from a very different background and we had differing opinions about what was going on in the case. However, we were able to amicably reach a verdict within about a day&#39;s deliberation. There were three points we disagreed upon at the beginning of deliberations and we took several votes before reaching consensus. Everyone, myself included contributed valid points to the discussion, and in the end, we all made concessions. We all wanted to do the right thing because we knew the gravity of our decision and that it would directly impact the lives of some people we didn&#39;t even know.

There were times when one or more girls in my Scout troop would be in tears over some real or imagined infraction. I followed the school&#39;s model of pulling in everyone involved to discuss what had happened. The girls were always able to talk it out once they calmed down and felt listened to.

During voter registrant drives, people would often make assumptions about my political affiliation. What I heard most often was something to the effect of, &quot;You don&#39;t want to register me to vote because I will just cancel out your vote.&quot; What I would tell them is that we may or may not agree on a single issue or candidate, but that we both had the same right to be heard. That each of us is a unique individual with a unique perspective, and that if they and others with similar viewpoints chose not to vote, then their voices would never be heard.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Since I have been a professional analyst for over twenty years, it goes without saying that I have an analytical mind. As a child, I built circuit boards with my dad, and used to love to do the logic problems in the Dell crossword puzzle books.

Prior to becoming an analyst, I worked in lending, and one of my favorite things to do was to have a customer complain to me that they were being charged too much interest. I would get out my calculator, take a printout of their payments showing principal and interest, taxes and insurance, and explain every entry to them as I typed it into the calculator reproducing the exact amount on the printout. Once they could understand how it worked and see it in black and white, nobody felt cheated any more - especially after I did a few more calculations showing them how much money they could save over the course of the loan by making their payments just a few days early.
