<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
$10 to Joe Biden. $100 to Elizabeth Warren and knocked doors and made phone calls for Liz in 2020. In 2016, I may have donated a nominal amount to a democrat. Pre-2015, I gave to some republican candidates.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I do not have experience in this.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that districts should be divided based on size and locations. I do not believe districts should be set based on anyone&#39;s political preference, association or need. I believe that districts should accurately reflect the temperature of given areas as best as possible. I believe that districts should not discriminate based on age, sex, nationality, race or sexual orientation but that each district should best represent the people of that area. I would do my best not to cave to any demands from someone with a political agenda and instead set districts based on shared commonalities, size and location alone.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I work as a contracting officer. We evaluate offers on a daily basis and give no preference to companies we like better or we know better. Before that, I worked as an insurance agent where my job was to consistently do the best I could for my company, which often meant going to a company that was a lower commission rate for me because it was better for my customer. In everything I do, I have a deep code of ethics and morals. I live my life trying to be fair to people and fight for justice as I am able and this would be no different. And while I am open to hearing the ideas of others and carefully weighing and considering their proposals, I am not a pushover who would allow the most outspoken person to railroad the other people involved. I would do my best to constantly keep in mind the will of the Colorado voters as a whole as I worked on this team.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Not only did I spend time working as a journalist and evaluating statements as true or false using research and statistics, I have also spent much of my life solving problems. I have worked as an accountant, an auditor, an insurance agent, a contracting officer, a journalist and a salesperson. I consistently have to solve problems for other people and I revel in the opportunity to do it. I absolutely love to solve problems. Whether it is a clogged sink, a home improvement project, a spat between friends, a difficult situation or a work issue, I like to be able to evaluate and solve problems.
