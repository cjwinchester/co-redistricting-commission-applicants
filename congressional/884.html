<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
My past position as the Director of Aging and Adult Services for the Colorado Department of Human Services, I advocated for Older Adults, Adults with Disabilities, and low-income adults.  I worked closely with the County Departments of Human Services, Area Agencies on Aging, Aging Disability Resource Centers, Independent Living Centers, community providers, State Legislators, other State Departments, advocate groups, the Colorado Commission on Aging, Colorado Cross Disability Coalition and stakeholders.  I am the Legislative Committee co-chair and on the Board of Colorado Senior Lobby for the past 6 years, but a member for 20 years.  I provide training to older adults on how to advocate for themselves and others at the legislature and in their communities.  I have worked for 30+ years serving individuals with disabilities, low-income families, older adults, and school age children.  I toured Colorado doing listening sessions and getting feedback from older adults, service providers, family members and  social service agencies prior to the White House Conference on Aging, then I was selected by the chair of the White House Conference to represent Colorado at this event which is held every 10 years.  After the Conference, I was instrumental in keeping the momentum going, by providing feedback to those who I met with before the conference and formed the &quot;SilverPrint Colorado&quot; entity.  This group had members throughout Colorado working on areas of health care, community engagement, protection and support for at-risk adults, ageism in the workforce and workforce issues for older adults, and transportation.  Throughout my life I have worked to make life easier for those who need and want the help.  In the PTA, I started a parents group for single parents to help them/us with the stresses of life, the issues our children had and to know that &quot;you are not alone&quot; in the journey.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Serving on this commission will provide a voice for the older adults in Colorado and those who may not have a voice of their own.  I want to see my community and Colorado come together in a fair and equitable way.  It&#39;s important to have fair and equal representation in each of the Congressional Districts.  Having lived in CD 7, 2 and 3 I have a good understanding of the similarities and differences in each district.   But more importantly, I am familiar with each of the counties in Colorado and their unique needs and how important the local control is to their citizens.  I want to assure that all are represented in the redistricting.


</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My 30 plus years of working for the State of Colorado in various  capacities and in different levels, I have worked well with others.  I started out working for the Developmental Disabilities programs, then moved to the Medicaid unit, and worked my way up to become the Director of Aging and Adult Services.  Throughout this time, I have worked with many community providers and clients to help them receive the most appropriate services for them and to help them understand the different programs available to them.  I worked with the County Departments of Human/Social  on providing education, receiving feedback and coming to consensus with program directors of the Medicaid and Human Services programs I worked, developed and administered.  It is important to remember that one size does not fit all of the state.  Colorado is very diverse and has different needs in each county.  I was able to work collaboratively with the Counties, service providers and clients to implement long-term care services in each county.  In the late 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s when the Single Entry Points were being developed I was working with the different County Commissioners and County Directors to help divide the state into 23 different long-term service providers and case managers.  This was a difficult task as each County wanted to be the center, and some counties didn&#39;t want to partner and work with their neighboring counties.  In addition, when Medicaid started to serve clients through the HMOs I worked with various HMOs, state legislators, physician groups, and hospitals to make sure all services were provided to clients in all areas of the state.  Then when I served on the Colorado Commission on Aging representing CD3, which is a very large and diverse district, I needed to be sure that all the cities, counties, rural and urban areas were represented and needed to work with the other Commissioners who represented their CD.  The Commission had a Democrat and a Republican from each district and worked on consensus.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As the Director of Aging for the Colorado Dept of Human Services, it was my responsibility to provide budget forecasting for the programs to the Ex. Director, the Joint Budget Committee, and the Office of State Planning and Budgeting, and to the State Auditors.  I have analytical skills, reasoning skills, good communication skills, consensus building skills, and am a creative thinker.  I am able to be detailed oriented as well as being able to see the big picture.  I have used mentoring, guidance, support, brainstorming as well as logic to be able to discuss different ideas and practices.  Between working with the state programs and working closely with school administrators, teachers and parents, I know how to bring people together to arrive at a decision that all can accept.  This doesn&#39;t mean that one side gets everything they want, it means we all work to get to a position that we can all accept as being fair and equitable and it can be implemented in an appropriate manner.
