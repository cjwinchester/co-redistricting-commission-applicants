<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have volunteered for and donated to a number of Democratic candidates up and down the ballot over the past few cycles. I have made a number of small dollar donations, primarily to Democrats. I donated $950 to Joe Biden&#39;s presidential campaign this cycle, in total, over the course of several smaller donations - this is the most money I have ever given to a single candidate. I donated between $450 and $550 total to former State Senator Mike Johnston when he was running for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in Colorado, and previously donated I believe between $300 and $500 to Mike Johnston in the previous cycle when he pursued the Democratic nomination for Colorado Governor. In all three of those cases (Vice President Biden&#39;s campaign for President, and both of Mike Johnston&#39;s campaigns for U.S. Senator and Colorado Governor), I set up an individualized link and raised several thousand dollars in additional contributions for each campaign from other friends and family. I have also donated very modestly ($200 or less) to a handful of other congressional and Senate candidates outside of Colorado. I donated $250 to Mayor Pete Buttigieg&#39;s presidential campaign in early 2020. I also believe I donated between $50 and $100 to U.S. Senator Michael Bennet&#39;s campaign for President in 2019. I donated very modestly (I believe $150 or less total) to Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign for president in the 2016 general election. I donated I believe between $300 and $500 total to Phil Weiser&#39;s campaign to be Colorado&#39;s Attorney General in 2018. I donated between $50 and $100 to Serena Gonzales-Gutierrez&#39;s campaign for a Colorado State House seat in 2018 and to Zach Neumann&#39;s campaign for a Colorado State Senate seat in the 2017-2018 cycle. There are likely a handful of additional donations I&#39;ve made to other candidates outside of Colorado for federal and state office, none of which would cumulatively exceed $500 over the last 5 years. In total, I&#39;d estimate I&#39;ve probably donated around or just over $3,000 to political campaigns and political causes over the past five years. I actively volunteered for the Biden campaign this year, and for the Clinton presidential campaign in 2016.

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I worked for the Colorado Office of State Planning and Budgeting (OSPB) from 2016 to 2019, a nonpartisan role; I considered my role in that position to be to serve the full state, and the people of Colorado. I previously worked as a staffer, Legislative Assistant and Policy Advisor for U.S. Senator Michael Bennet from 2011 to 2014; again, I considered my role to be to serve the entire state of Colorado in that job. 

I currently work as a Policy Director for an organization called America Forward, a national Coalition of over 100 nonprofits that work on education, workforce, early childhood education, affordable housing, evidence-based policy, and other related issues. Very few of these organizations are based in or have a robust presence in Colorado. I have served in that role for the past 18 months, while living in Colorado. In my current role, I do engage in some limited nonpartisan policy advocacy at the federal level. I do not engage in any advocacy at the state level in Colorado now, or at any time since taking my current position. My organization is a 501(c)3 - our mission is nonpartisan. If my affiliation with my current employer ended up being a factor that prevented me from serving, I would be willing to take a long-term leave of absence to serve on the commission if that proves necessary. I am not a registered federal or state lobbyist. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I was born and raised in Colorado, and I know this is a special state. It’s a place with open blue skies, and also open minds. With over 300 days of sun each year, Coloradans tend toward optimism, and the view that we can summit any fourteener if we keep putting one foot in front of another. We care about our community, and we’re kind to our neighbors. We tend toward pragmatic progress over zealotry. We prefer a cool mountain breeze to a lot of hot air. 

But those Colorado values I love are increasingly at odds with the political polarization and fierce ideologies sweeping across this country. There are hundreds of data points, to say nothing of the most recent election and common sense, demonstrating partisan vitriol is getting worse. Americans used to be able to disagree without being disagreeable, but that is increasingly challenging in an era where the other side is seen as not just wrong, but evil. This toxic culture is leeching into our state, along with the rest of the country, infecting Colorado like a chemical seeping into our water. I see it more clearly than ever this year; road trips from Denver or Boulder to Alamosa or the Western Slope have begun to feel like voyages to a different society, at least when it comes to politics. 

There are a dozen interacting drivers of this growing polarization, too numerous to dissect much less solve in this statement. But I believe partisan gerrymandering is one important and underrated cause of this growing dysfunction. Gerrymandering is a self-reinforcing cycle. As state legislative and Congressional seats get carved up into increasingly “safe seats,” elected representatives cater more to their respective bases, and less to unaffiliated voters. The members of Congress and state legislators who represent gerrymandered districts go on to become governors, senators, cabinet secretaries and presidents, elevating their strident brand of partisanship in the process. Unaffiliated voters, disgusted by our hyper-polarized politics, disengage, which induces politicians to cater even more to their relatively more engaged bases. A new generation of ever more polarized elected officials gerrymander districts ever more aggressively with ever more powerful technological tools. Rinse, and repeat. 

I am passionate about disrupting this vicious cycle, and have been for a long time. As a college freshman in fact, I wrote an op-ed in my college newspaper sixteen years ago (submitted separately), arguing that “bipartisan commissions could be established following each census in every state to reevaluate congressional districts and redraw the boundaries along lines that made geographic sense.” When Amendments Y and Z were on the Colorado ballot two years ago, I carefully reviewed the proposed new design, and voted for them enthusiastically. It would be an honor to serve my community and my state next year, and work toward a less poisonous politics, by serving on one of the two nonpartisan redistricting commissions authorized by those amendments. 

My interest in this cause is connected to my broader commitment to public service, and my passion for making government at all levels work better for the people it serves. As a policy advisor to Colorado’s U.S. Senator Michael Bennet – an independent-minded public servant who often noted that Colorado is roughly “a third Democratic, a third Independent, and a third Republican,” – I drafted and helped introduce a bipartisan bill that became law, creating a transformative new federal fund to pay for projects based not on the cost of services, but rather based on the measurable positive outcomes those services yield. Subsequently, and on a related topic, when I worked for Colorado’s Office of State Planning and Budgeting, I launched the first state-level projects in Colorado history to leverage “Pay for Success,” a model that links public dollars to measurable outcomes. These projects deployed over $6 million to fund preventive, effective home-visiting and school-based programs, with state funding tied to successfully reducing arrests, incarceration and out-of-home placements for Colorado youth. I’m also proud that at least two of the three projects are on track to redirect state dollars toward proven programs after the projects end, and in several respects helped catalyze broader reforms within these systems. 

These examples underscore my view that democracy works better when voters have faith in the competence of their government, and therefore when those who administer public programs rely on evidence, depend on data, and invest in performance management. These are causes for which I have fought in a number of capacities over the past decade, and they are values that would guide me on this commission. Digging into the data with Coloradans from across the political spectrum to draw a new, updated redistricting map that is more fair, less partisan, more competitive, empowers more Colorado voters and helps restore even a little bit of confidence in our elective process would be a deeply energizing and fulfilling experience. 

Finally, as a member of the LGBT community, the cause of protecting the rights of every Coloradan, regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation, is personal to me, and one more important motivation to serve on this commission. I believe in protecting the rights of minorities, and ensuring every Coloradan has a voice in our system through this process.

<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
If you surveyed my colleagues and friends, they would tell you I draw energy from people – from their stories, their aspirations, and their ideas. I thrive on connecting with colleagues in a meeting, over coffee, or at a happy hour. They might tell you I read a room well, that I’m affable, and that I can handle tricky interpersonal dynamics deftly yet genuinely. 

What drives a number of these attributes is that, overwhelmingly, I just like people. I’m usually a glass half full kind of person – and that goes for other people, especially. I try hard never to be overly judgmental, leap to conclusions about someone, or write a person off because of one or two personality traits – I tend to believe most people are a mix of positive intentions and foibles, strengths and weaknesses. I find life is both more fun and productive if, without ignoring someone’s limitations, you meet them where they are and focus on the value they add to the world, rather than fixating and what you’d like to change. 

I mention this because it’s related to one of my strengths: consensus-building. As a congressional staffer for U.S. Senator Michael Bennet, I thrived at the task of negotiating legislation, navigating between staff, members and other stakeholders both to my boss’s left and to his right on some thorny issue, and working to land on a “sweet spot” that everyone could support. Later, as a project manager in Colorado’s Office of State Planning and Budgeting, I built consensus across dozens of stakeholders to get the “Pay for Success” projects I managed for the state off the ground. In the course of that work, I partnered with and managed state and local agencies, school districts, foundations, banks, nonprofits, evaluators, and others, bringing over twenty stakeholders together to sign off on complicated state contracts, funder agreements and evaluation plans, hundreds of pages long, that tied state funding to measurable outcomes for the first time in Colorado history. I also crafted and advocated for legislation funding this initiative, securing support from the three Democrats and three Republicans on the Colorado legislature’s Joint Budget Committee. 

I believe politics is the art of the possible, and posturing in our respective corners is a lot less useful for the world than working to get to yes. I thrive at the work of negotiating compromises that everyone can sign onto, and I’ve done it repeatedly throughout my career.

I am a proud lifelong Democrat. As I member of this commission however, I would work to put a fair redistricting map above partisanships, and build consensus for a map that serves Colorado well. In a number of different capacities, I have fought for an evidence-based, data-driven approach to public problem-solving – that approach defined my work in both federal and state government, it defines my current work in the nonprofit sector, and it would define my work on the commission. My faith in evidence, data, and hard facts, and my eagerness to build bipartisan consensus, would make me a fair and impartial commission member.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I believe it’s important to be open-minded when confronted with a new challenge, not leap to hasty conclusions, dig patiently through the available evidence and data, and listen carefully to a diverse range of experts and people with direct experience with the problem, drilling down with probing questions. Most challenges are complicated; they resist simple solutions, and solutions are elusive without a deep understanding of the problem itself. 

My former boss, U.S. Senator Michael Bennet, used to say no problem could be solved without a “shared understanding of the facts,” by which he meant, before we try to craft a durable solution, everyone in the room has to agree on and internalize the same set of facts underlying the problem. Senator Bennet believed this is essential to facilitate productive, collaborative problem-solving, and I internalized that lesson. For this reason, when I don’t feel I understand the full dimensions of a problem, I become restlessly inquisitive, asking follow-up questions, probing further, researching more, consulting additional sources, and talking to more experts and colleagues with relevant experience. Then, when I finally fully grasp the four corners of that challenge, I work hard to explain the problem clearly and concisely to the other stakeholders involved in solving it, putting together concise, well-sourced briefings, clear one-pagers, or illuminating charts that are easy to understand, all with the goal of establishing a “shared understanding of the facts” that will create the conditions necessary to solve the problem. 

As I have underscored in my previous answers, I have worked deeply on evidence-based policy in a number of different capacities. I believe in a “show me the evidence,” approach to public policy, over “policy by anecdote.” I also believe that “data-driven analysis” is much more than a nice phrase. Data, like any powerful tool, can be used for good or for ill. When it comes to redistricting, both political parties have increasingly leveraged registration and voter data to gerrymander districts with scientific precision. But the troves of electoral data in Colorado could also be leveraged by a nonpartisan commission for the opposite purpose, to draw a map that is fairer, more competitive, more equitable, and more conducive to a brand of Colorado politics that puts consensus ahead of confrontation. 

I honed my data-driven, analytical skills through a two year MPA program at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs, where I enrolled in a number of courses focused on economics, statistics, program evaluation and behavioral psychology. I regularly draw on this training when I am confronted with any analytical problem. I believe this analytical toolbox could be of value to the commission. 

This approach in general defines my approach to government, and to many professional challenges. I like digging into research, and answering challenging policy questions with sources, statistics, and facts. I believe data and evidence should drive public policy.
