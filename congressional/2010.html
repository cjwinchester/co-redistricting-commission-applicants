<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>

Contribution to Lauren Boebert campaign
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>

Morale, Welfare and Recreation offices as Advisory Council Board Member, 2014-2017.  Member Heidelberg and Wiesbaden Rod &amp; Gun Clubs.  CAMEO Shooting and Education complex volunteer Range Safety Officer. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I&#39;d like to support Colorado, since much of my military and government experience has been overseas.  I believe that my experience brings a degree of international flavor to a critical State-wide initiative.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Obtaining consensus sometimes involves understanding the unspoken comment.  I believe that the Commission will have a goal of  preparing a well-worked plan, but personal views and insights may degrade the process.  Identifying and understanding the framework that each person brings to the Commission will provide a way to find a common cause.  I sometimes had to apply this during disputes or disagreements among competing offices or among my staff.  Resolving the issues among competing offices mostly involved listening  critically, then offering some other approaches that were not readily evident.  Resolving staff issues was many tomes more complex, and frustrating, since some acceptable resolutions for the staff were the result of policies.  The single most difficult issue was the requirement to identify civilians whose service exceeded five years overseas, then recommend curtailments.  Many staff were married to local nationals, and had no desire to return to the U.S.  This made an impersonal policy become suddenly very personal.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
During federal service, I authored manuals, guidelines, procedures and infopapers for U.S. official use during international inspection activities.  Many reports required the synthesis of foreign information into U.S. publications, and these reports were often viewed at high levels of U.S. government  organizations.  The most notable is Army Europe Regulation 525-50, which codifies all responses to foreign inspections and international guests.  I also served as a Contracting Officer Representative, with responsibility for timely review of seven varied contracts, some U.S., some foreign, with mutually acceptable results.  Several contracts covered visits by foreign dignitaries, with unpredictable changes during the events.  One of my last recommendations became the proposed course of action for the U.S. Army on how to conform a new U.S. base in a foreign country to international arms control standards.  I was able to obtain agreement from the U.S. European Command, Department of Army and the Office of the Secretary of Defense to possibly implement the approach that I outlined.  I was also able to attain agreements among German and Italian officials for security and financial support when hosting international visitors to U.S. sites.
