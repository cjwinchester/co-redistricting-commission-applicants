<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
While employed as Executive Director for Project Self-Sufficiency of Loveland - Fort Collins (1989-2014) I worked closely with the Board of Directors to set policy, create the budget, and engage in community relations. During this time I often assisted in resolving differences, explaining the needs of the program participants and staff, and setting the direction for the organization. I took a democratic approach to staff supervision and utilized staff meetings to make joint decisions after listening to varying points of view.  I represented the organization and our constituents at advocacy meetings in Denver at the Women&#39;s Foundation of Colorado. There we discussed barriers to the well being of our constituent populations and planned interventions to secure resources and encourage needed governmental policy changes. We gathered data on the &quot;cliff effect&quot; that results when families lose benefits following very small wage increases. I attended many interagency community meetings in Fort Collins over those years to engage in conversations with many other organizations serving similar client populations. We networked, found ways to work together to solve problems, shared information and resources, and worked together to communicate with funders on behalf of disadvantaged individuals and families. I continue to maintain many of these relationships today and am sometimes called upon to assist in my retirement years. This has included volunteering for the City of Loveland during their annual event to distribute needed items and resource information.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am currently volunteering for the Gordon McLaughlin campaign for DA for 8th Judicial District and also for the Biden-Harris campaign. This involves phone calling and sign delivery. Prior to this, I assisted two campaigns to secure signatures to get on the primary ballot. The candidates were Kim Akeley Charron for Larimer County Commissioner and Lorena Garcia for US Senate from Colorado. In the past I have delivered literature and sometimes knocked on doors on behalf of candidates. I have also made phone calls and sent text messages in support of various campaigns over the years. I am currently supporting 25 to 30 different local, statewide, and national candidates for office in amounts that range from $25 to $100. I do this approximately once each month. I always attend my local precinct caucuses. I have attended some virtual county and state Democratic Party meetings in recent months.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have a group of friends who write letters to elected officials and I have done this with them a number of times over the past year. I have done much of the upfront research on the issues this group addresses. I continue to volunteer for Project Self-Sufficiency of Loveland - Fort Collins, a local nonprofit that assists single parents in moving from poverty to financial independence. I was the Executive Director for that organization for 25 years and continue to serve on the Scholarship Committee, host a table at the luncheon, and consult with the current Executive Director. I serve on the Board of Directors for the Sam S. Bloom Foundation (Centennial, Colorado) that funds nonprofit organizations statewide. I chair the Nominating Committee and the Motivated Families Program Committee for that organization. Recently I served on Larimer County&#39;s advisory committee to distribute federal COVID 19 dollars to local organizations. We read proposals and made recommendations. I am a field instructor for the Colorado State University School of Social Work field education program. I worked for that organization for three years and then continued as a volunteer field instructor after I retired in December of 2017. This involves meeting with either graduate or undergraduate students weekly throughout the semester to provide guidance and instruction.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
During my professional career I had little time to participate in something as time consuming and demanding as serving on a commission like this. I have always been drawn to opportunities like this one but have hesitated both because of time considerations and also because of potential conflicts with the requirements of my employment. I am now free to take on something like this wholeheartedly and with great enthusiasm. I began thinking about this possibility as soon as I saw the ballot issue that created these commissions. I was thrilled to see it pass with voter approval. I am proud of Colorado for being on the forefront with this new and exciting process. I would love to serve as a commission member, knowing full well how much responsibility this would be and embracing the challenge. The outcomes of the decisions made by the commissions are highly impactful and important. I believe I can help build consensus and provide needed objectivity, seeing the big picture and the needs of our State as a whole while also valuing the impact to various localities. During my employment with Colorado State University, I met with students in the Distance Learning Program around the State of Colorado, with much of my time spent in Colorado Springs and Denver Metro as well as locally in Larimer County. I visited students in Gunnison,  Salida, and in La Junta. In a separate effort I did consulting work in Durango evaluating local needs and resources for a potential self-sufficiency program. I believe I have gained valuable experience regarding statewide needs during the course of performing these duties.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe the basis for consensus building is seeking common ground and looking at shared values and experiences. I would seek to understand the thinking of my fellow committee members and identify shared concerns and values. I would look carefully at differences of opinion and consider any bias I might be experiencing. I would listen carefully to information provided by staff and the testimony of Colorado residents in forming and sharing opinions. I would be open to hearing and considering varied points of view, looking at possible unintended consequences and long term impacts of decisions to be made. I would add my own research to that of others in considering all possibilities and narrowing options. I am rather compulsive about fairness. I would consider all the various populations and communities that would be impacted and what their special needs might be. I would be cognizant of income disparities and ethic diversity. How would their experiences with this system vary? How would the outcomes affect their lives? I would use common sense in keeping communities together in the same district and work hard to avoid splitting communities of interest.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I pride myself on thoroughly thinking through a possible decision, considering all possible outcomes, pros and cons, potential unanticipated consequences, while keeping a focus on the intended purpose and ultimate goal. During my professional management years, it was important to consider the mission of the organization while setting program and organizational policy. Constantly reminding myself and others of why we were there, what we were setting out to accomplish, who was counting on us, and why it was important. When relevant I would look at research and best practices, considering similar situations and how those decisions turned out. Learning from past mistakes is critical.
