<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I’ve spent more than 40 years organizing, representing, advocating for, and considering the interests of groups, organizations, and associations in Colorado as a public finance lawyer and as a board member of a variety of Colorado governmental and nonprofit organizations.

As a public finance lawyer, I’ve represented and advocated for the interests of state and local governments in hundreds of complex financing transactions involving many billions of dollars.  As the “bond counsel” (the lead lawyer) and principal draftsman of the documents governing these transactions, my role has been to ensure that the interests, rights and obligations of my state and local government clients, as well as the other governments, financial institutions, groups, organizations, associations and private parties involved in the transactions, are thoroughly considered and balanced so that I can draft the legal documents that clearly describe the rights and obligations of all parties.  I’ve organized new Colorado governmental organizations by drafting and working in the legislature to enact legislation creating new governmental organizations, negotiating and drafting intergovernmental agreements and organizational documents governing the new governmental organizations and representing those organizations in negotiating and completing financings; examples include public highway authorities, regional transportation authorities, CDOT’s bridge enterprise and high-performance transportation enterprise and the Building Excellent Schools Today program. 

As a board member and officer of a variety of Colorado governmental and nonprofit organizations (see list of organizations in the answer to the preceding question), I’ve had intensive hands-on experience in organizing, representing, advocating for, and considering the interests of my organizations, the constituents of my organizations and the other Colorado groups, organizations, and associations with which they interact.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that political polarization is destroying rational political discourse and compromise and, unless we find a way to reduce it, will eventually destroy our democracy.  I am hopeful that careful, balanced redistricting will reduce polarization and promote civil, respectful conversations and compromise. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I’ve spent the last 40+ years successfully promoting consensus and helping to create agreement among a wide variety of people with competing interests and agendas.  As a public finance lawyer, I’ve successfully promoted consensus and helped create agreement among people with competing interests and agendas in order to complete financings.  As a board member and officer of governmental and nonprofit organizations, I’ve successfully promoted consensus and helped create agreement among people with competing interests and agendas in developing and implementing community-based policies and programs for the benefit of  governmental and nonprofit organizations, their constituents and the public.

I have experience being fair and impartial in hearing and ruling on student discipline cases as a member of the Denver School Board, evaluating employees as a partner in a law firm, as a member of the Denver School Board and as a board member of nonprofit organizations and evaluating and selecting the best proposal for services and goods submitted pursuant to request for proposal processes as the Treasurer and a member of evaluation panels for Denver Public Schools and as a member of evaluation panels established by my governmental clients and the nonprofit boards on which I have served.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I’ve spent the last 40+ years using my analytical skills, logic and reason to solve problems and bring people together: to complete complex, multi-party public finance transactions as a public finance lawyer; and to implement community-based policies and programs as a board member and officer of a variety of governmental and nonprofit organizations.

As the “bond counsel” (the lead lawyer) for hundreds of complex public finance transactions involving billions and billions of dollars, it has been my job: to identify the legal, financial and operational issues involved in the transactions; to facilitate negotiations among the parties until everyone agrees on all the rights and obligations of each party; to draft the legal documents governing the transactions; to revise and rerevise the legal documents until everyone’s issues have been resolved and written down; and, finally, to deliver legal opinions that the financing transaction described in the legal documents complies with a complex array of federal, state and local laws.
	
As a board member and officer of governmental and nonprofit organizations, I’ve spent thousands of hours using my analytical skills, logic, and reason to identify and resolve issues for my constituents, the community we serve and the public.
