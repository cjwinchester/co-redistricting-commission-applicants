  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I was a volunteer with the Colorado Democrats and Boulder County Democrats in the 2020 cycle, and with the Boulder County Democrats in the 2018 cycle.  I was a Legislative Assistant on the staff of U.S. Senator Al Gore from 1988-1991. Recent campaign contributions (to the best of my knowledge and available records) have included: Jason Crow, U.S. Congress Chris Nevitt, City of Denver Auditor Joe Neguse, U.S. Congress New Era Colorado Progress Now Colorado Boulder County Democrats John Hickenlooper, U.S. Senate Elizabeth Warren, Democratic Presidential Primary Joe Biden, U.S. President Fair Fight (Georgia) Theresa Greenfield, U.S. Senate (Iowa) Raphael Warnock, U.S. Senate (Georgia) Karen McCormick, U.S. Congress National Democratic Redistricting Committee People&#39;s Choice for President Institute.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have provided election-cycle-related volunteer services to the Boulder County Democrats. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Recently, as the CEO of an investment platform for a Denver-based family office, I led the development of a proposed project to supply drinking water to certain communities in Northern Colorado.  The effort required a great deal of work with state, municipal, and private actors, all of them potential stakeholders in the project.  And, because it was, after all, a water supply project, it was very important to meet everyone&#39;s needs.  After about 18 months of work, we were forced to shelve the project.  However, the experience was typical of similar projects I have been involved in over the course of my career, which always required integrating the interests of multiple stakeholders in complex infrastructure projects.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The de-politicization of the redistricting process is a crucial and achievable step along the path to bringing more unity to our nation and addressing our polarized politics.  This is one of the most important issues facing our country, so an opportunity to participate directly in the process would be both humbling and exciting.


</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I learned how to listen and take on-board the opinions of others, and to build consensus among stakeholders, from a career that included roles as a company founder and president, as a senior executive in multi-national engineering firms, as a professional staff member in the U.S. Senate, and as the executive in charge of developing energy, water, and infrastructure projects in the U.S and internationally.  In all these roles, it was necessary to craft strategies, execute, and deliver projects, policy initiatives, and outcomes that best met the needs of all stakeholders.  I learned early that if you don&#39;t bring all of the players along, sooner or later you&#39;ll face barriers that could have been avoided, and I&#39;ve been trained in team and consensus building not only by experience, but also in more formal corporate training and third-party specialists.  Regarding fairness and impartiality, it is clear that whether the issue is mail-in voting, or the impartial drawing of Congressional and legislative maps, Colorado can be an example to the nation in terms of bringing more access and fairness to our political process.  The redistricting commissions, by definition, have an important responsibility to execute this work transparently and impartially, so that all stakeholders can respect the outcome.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As you will note from my bio and CV, my career has focused on work that applied technical, financial, and policy analysis skills to important commercial and political issues of the last 30 years, working for both public institutions and private corporations.  My undergraduate and graduate training is in the disciplines of engineering, international economics, international law, and finance.  I have worked as a corporate executive for global engineering firms, as a policy analyst in well-known Washington, DC think tanks, as the leader of integrated teams developing, designing, and financing major infrastructure projects, and as a legislative aide managing major policy areas for a U.S. Senator.  My bio and CV will provide more details.
