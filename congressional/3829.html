<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In terms of political activity, I volunteered with New Era Colorado doing nonpartisan voter registration and get out the vote canvassing (2018-2019). I have also volunteered on several texting and phone banking campaigns. I have not donated money to campaigns or other political organizations. 

In Spring of 2017 I was involved in the planning and hosting of a local March for Science (In Sarasota, Florida) in conjunction with a nationally staged March for Science that took place in DC. 


</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
New Era Colorado, Freedom for Immigrants, Intercambio, New College of Florida Student Association (the student government body), specifically the judicial branch. 

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
The experience I have in organizing and advocating for different groups of people or movements has introduced me to communities next door and across the country. 

In Colorado, I have been involved with New Era Colorado, and Intercambio (an ESL school based in Boulder). My involvement with New Era Colorado included Get Out the Vote canvassing and voter registration in 2018 and 2019. This meant phone banking, registering people to vote at local events, answering questions about the voting and registration process, and hearing people&#39;s concerns and sharing my own experiences with the voting process, thereby encouraging new young voters to exercise their rights and recognize the importance of their voices in elections. 

At Intercambio, I volunteer taught evening classes in Lafayette to young adult and adult immigrants from across the globe. I grew close with many of the students and teachers and valued my time there as a way to become acquainted with the people in my community. In turn, my time at Intercambio strengthened the love I have for the state of Colorado and the people who live here. 

In Sarasota, Florida, I helped organize and lead a citywide March for Science in conjunction with the national March for Science in DC in 2017. This involved facilitating meetings with peers and interested members of the community, all with the shared interest of representing Sarasota-Bradenton in a nationwide movement focused on preserving the integrity of scientific research and public education. My tasks when planning this event included leading meetings to gather input from the community, internal coordination and organization, social media group moderating, interviews and correspondence with press, volunteer coordination and training, advertising, and networking with a variety of different local organizations, from the local Sierra Club chapter, to local political and social justice groups, to Sarasota science education initiatives. The final result culminated in an event attended by ~1,200 people from around the county, with a number of speakers and a tabling event afterwards where attendees could meet, network, and familiarize themselves with the happenings of their city.

In January-February of 2018 I traveled to Alta Verapaz, Guatemala to set up an English teaching curriculum at the local secondary school. This work included constructing a curriculum, teaching classes by sampling different teaching materials, and compiling resources the students and faculty could use to continue the program, with their feedback. I became acquainted with the students and teachers and sought their input regarding their goals for the program and how it would continue after I left. In order to gain a better understanding of the needs and priorities of the school and the community it serves, I interviewed students and their families (sometimes via Q&#39;eqchi&#39;-to-Spanish translator) to better understand their goals and hear their experiences. This work culminated in a new working relationship between the school and my alma mater, and strengthened the bonds of everyone involved in the program, both in Florida and Guate. Since my stay, my former college has sent students every semester to teach English and continue their coursework, there have been a number of group trips from Florida to Guatemala involving college students and family members of the Sarasota school district, and the relationship forged between both communities continues to grow.  

While I acknowledge the prompt specifically asked for my experience in organizing/advocating for organizations in Colorado, I similarly value the experiences I&#39;ve had in other places, local or not-so-local, as they inform many of the skills I would bring to the table of this commission. I believe they paint a representative picture of who I am, what drives me, and where I am the most effective in what I do. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
During the time I&#39;ve spent attending trainings, meetings, organizing events, educating others and advocating for causes, I have realized that a common thread in my efforts is the desire to continue educating myself, and to help inform others of issues that impact them, encourage people to get more involved and passionate about their local communities, and recognize the individual power they have to affect change. I believe that many people want to be in the know about their government and how decisions are made and what gets prioritized, and I think that the passage of Amendments Y and Z proves that people value transparency and having the choice of input, things I highly value as well. I also recognize that involving oneself in local politics, or activism, or community efforts can quickly become overwhelming and feel inaccessible for many. By serving on the re-districting commission, I would especially want to focus on making the process accessible and equitable to the people we serve and to whom we are are ultimately accountable. 

I believe I will be a valuable asset to this commission with both my advocacy and organizing experience as well as my educational and professional background in technical and analysis-heavy fields. I will be able to enter this role with a thorough understanding of how to effectively disseminate information, and how to successfully compile, analyze, and visualize the data needed to achieve the goal of re-districting, while maintaining transparency that benefits the community. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
While my life, history, and schooling have exposed me to a variety of opinions, ideologies, and world views, my job has allowed me to develop the necessary skills of facilitating discussion (at times of varying heatedness and urgency) that can reach effective resolutions. In a setting involving seeking compromises and/or decisions alongside other commissioners, I believe I would bring level-headedness and effective problem-solving to the table that can help us progress in such a way that every member feels heard. 

In a group setting I feel I am accountable both to other teammates and myself to be communicative and acknowledge every varying opinion or idea shared in the space. I have experience with facilitating collaborative settings in my day-to-day role in application support, and seeking input from a variety of sources is essential to this role. As part of the job when responding to urgent issues or outages, I guide incident calls and make actionable decisions and critical problem-solving steps based on input from other support teams present in order to triage and resolve problems, and I work to promote consensus by maintaining open dialogue across all associates and departments represented. 

My ability to maintain fairness and impartiality, particularly in political matters, comes from my background. I have grown up surrounded by communities and family members on either side of the political spectrum, and anywhere in between. On a personal level, I recognize that an individual&#39;s beliefs or political ideologies can be a product of their upbringing, occupation, socioeconomic level, racial and ethnic background, trauma, history, and many, many other factors, but that these ultimately don&#39;t negate their character and moral values. My mother&#39;s family, who fled during Partition from the Punjab region of Pakistan, grew up in a time of enormous political strife and a stark colonial presence. They immigrated to the Midwestern US in the late 1950&#39;s, navigating a tense racial landscape and the remnants of segregationist policies and customs that made it more difficult for families like mine to succeed. I cannot speak to how my grandparents&#39; or my mother&#39;s experiences of growing up in the Midwest during this period ultimately impacted how they viewed government and politics. I do know that it was informed by years of navigating an entirely new culture and society, while working hard to build a life here as one of only a few thousand Indian families settled in the US at the time. My family&#39;s history is very personal to me, and while I do not always see eye-to-eye with my parents I recognize that their belief systems are greatly influenced by our heritage, as well as their own lived experiences, similarly to my own. My own history is one of millions of the diverse stories and voices that comprise this country and that comprise Colorado, and I would strive to give equal weight and value to the voices of those that make up the commission, and the communities we serve, as I would want others to do the same for me. 

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have an extensive technical and analytical background which includes experience in data analysis, coding, and research in a number of fields including mathematics, history, politics, and social sciences. 

In my current role, a great deal of technical analysis and computer systems knowledge are needed to solve day-to-day user issues as well as significant outages or other application problems that impact a wide user-base. I am skilled at disseminating this knowledge to a range of audiences with varying technical experience, and I feel very at home in a role that allows me to synthesize both my analytical and communication skills, something that would be required in a re-districting commission where much of the reasoning and methodology behind the decisions made would need to be translatable to a diverse audience. 

Other areas of my experience include my college coursework, where in order to graduate with both of my concentrations I completed 2 theses: a mathematics thesis that involved advanced mathematical modeling and statistical methodologies to study a computational biology problem, and a Spanish thesis in which I conducted an historical and political analysis of the Guatemalan coup in 1954 and the economic, political, and international factors that led to it. Both of these papers involved extensive research and analysis in two entirely separate fields. I believe that my ability to have completed and successfully defended both speaks to the aptness of my skillset for the commission, in which the research and methodology for re-drawing will likely synthesize a similar set of skills of which I am well-acquainted: statistics and mathematical modeling, data analysis, politics, and sociological and economic factors. 

In a real-world setting I have similarly applied my research skills to a volunteer role at Freedom for Immigrants, where I contributed to a project called Detention in Your District; an initiative that gathers and publishes informational sheets on ICE facilities in different congressional districts, as a means of educating residents and local legislators. Throughout this project, I compiled information from government databases, verifiable local news sources and journalists, and independent reports, in order to create cohesive informational sheets for public availability. More recently, I created a similar fact sheet for the Aurora ICE facility to distribute at a recent educational event (available upon request). Through this research, I&#39;ve become familiarized with the purviews of congressional districts, the financial implications and influence of the ICE detention and jail industries depending on the towns or cities in which they are situated, the relationship between local governments, private contractors, and sheriff&#39;s facilities, how audits and oversight are conducted on state and federal levels, and how the presence of the facilities impact the communities-at-large. I believe this work, by extension, greatly informed my understanding of local economies and the importance of taking a town&#39;s primary source of income, or the industry in which most of a town&#39;s jobs reside, into account when discussing how best to structure Colorado&#39;s districts. Acknowledging Colorado&#39;s diverse economy and the smaller towns which almost entirely depend on certain sectors will be vital to this role, as well as taking into account how the presence of these industries impacts the ideologies of the people, and how their necessities will differ.
