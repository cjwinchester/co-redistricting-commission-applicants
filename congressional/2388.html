<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I am a long time active member of the Democratic Party and a long time advocate for good government and evidence based policy making. I have been an advocate for secular people in Colorado and an advocate for weaker land use regulation.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been active in the Democratic Party since arriving in Colorado in 1996. I have attended more than one state Democratic Party convention all prior to 2012, I was a treasurer for a Democratic Party counter commissioner candidate in Mesa County, Colorado in the late 1990s, I served for several years as a Precinct Committee Person in my Denver neighborhood in the early 2000s, I was Treasurer of the Democratic Party of Denver (2/07-2/09), and I was a law partner of a Anne McGihon (as Democratic party state representative) through 2009 and assisted her in her official as well as her professional duties in that capacity. Since November 10, 2015, I have donated money to Jena Griswold for Colorado (three donations of $360 from 12/28/17 to 10/2/18); Romanoff for Colorado ($50 on 9/29/19), Denver Democratic Central Committee ($20 on 3/9/20); McCorkle for Colorado ($100 on 5/17/2020); Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez For Congress ($27 on 6/21/20) and ActBlue ($2.70 on 6/21/20).

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My firm command of the mathematical and legal considerations that go into drafting district boundaries, my rich and detailed knowledge of Colorado&#39;s physical, human, political, social and historical geography (drawn from practicing law both on the Western Slope, in its mountain communities, and in all major Front Range cities rural and urban, and from having family in Akron, Colorado) and skill and experience with working fruitfully within committees makes it possible for me to provide a well informed, thoughtful contribution to the commission&#39;s work.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have spent a lifetime taking complex technical issues as applied to specific factual situations in a manner that an ordinary layperson can understand, and I have decades of experience (predating my professional career through involvement in student government in college and law school) in negotiating compromises among people with serious disagreements (e.g. labor and manage disputes, protester and administration disputes, and Republican and sex-coop disputes while in student government). One of my hobbies is science journalism via my Dispatches From Turtle Island blog on issues of anthropology, prehistory, population genetics, and fundamental physics. I have successfully mediated a hot and ideological litigation disputes with a self-identified Nazi with a dog named Himmler. In the several layers of the caucus process every two years in Denver, I&#39;ve been one of the most efficient and effective meeting facilitators in the City. I have experience conducting meetings with a Feminist process or consensus process as well as conventional Robert&#39;s Rules of Order processes. I have facilitated class discussions as a professor on highly charged issues. I know how to listen and have many years of experience judging speech and debate competitions impartially. I am committed to the goal of drawing even handed electoral districts for Colorado.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I provided mathematical support of cluster analysis methods used in the development of the National Drought Atlas (an effort my father who was a leader in geographic information systems was leading). I have routinely analyzed census data and other public domain data down to the census block and individual school level since I was in high school for a variety of purposes. For example, I analyzed Denver Public Schools data to show the effect of different high schools in its system on the college prospects of students identified as gifted and talented (shocking negative in the case of former West High School). My undergraduate studies were focused on applied mathematics including statistical analysis and operations research in which I solved problems such as developing algorithms for airline logistics, traffic light systems, and efficient delivery routes. I have used multidisciplinary methods including archaeology, climate history, linguistics and population genetics to develop credible hypotheses in historical linguistics, some of which have been cited in academic journals. I routinely analyze legal problems in transactional tax analysis and in litigation at the trial court, intermediate appellate court and Colorado Supreme Court level.
