</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>

  80118
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not been particularly politically active but have kept up on politics and discussions on both sides of the political spectrum.  I have not donated to political groups as we focus our charitable giving to organizations that support people in Colorado with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am a volunteer Special Olympics Swimming coach and, as a father of an adult with a genetic condition,  I actively advise and fund raise for two non-profit organizations:  Prader Willi Syndrome Association of Colorado and Trailhead Community which seeks to provide affordable housing options and an independent and empowering living experience for Colorado residents with disabilities.  Professionally, I am a member of the Rocky Mountain chapter of the Tailhook Association, a group of ex-Navy pilots who promote Navy Aviation and support academic scholarships for college bound students. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have decades of leadership and collaboration experience working with diverse groups and demographics in my time in the Navy and as a global performance consultant.  I have worked globally in diverse cultures including Africa, Indonesia, and Thailand.  My company embeds with our clients from the front line to the boardroom to align diverse, multi-disciplinary teams to achieve common goals - we advocate respect for diverse opinions and perspectives.  My experience working with and for disabled adults has taught me humility and to listen first to better understand not only people&#39;s ideas but their life context that inform their perspective.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to see a united Colorado that residents from all political backgrounds can believe in and support, regardless of party, race, gender, social status, or any other differences we may have.  I hope to ensure the commission is transparent and answerable to all of our voters - if they do not understand our charter and decisions, they will not trust or respect them.  It is the commission&#39;s duty to EARN the trust of the Coloradans that we serve.  I believe I can bring patience and unity to the commission and will help bring a unifying message to all of Colorado.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have dedicated my life to developing leaders of character and integrity - first in the military to include time as a USAFA professor and now in the corporate world.  I recognized the difference between management and leadership and the vital role each plays in shepherding the process we&#39;ve been tasked with and making sound decisions.  Management is about dealing with the complexity the commission will face in planning and problem solving.  Good management involves knowing and valuing the unique abilities and even the eccentricities of the commission members and how best to integrate them into a coordinated plan.  Leadership is about producing useful change and obtaining buy-in - Aligning people with a vision through communication.  Commission leadership is about discovering what is universal and capitalize on it but focusing on what unites us and the values we all share.  

We will need integrity and both solid management and leadership in the commission.  One of my favorite quotes is from Dr. Peter Pronovost -  “Things done to others, rather than with them, are highly resisted, they are usually never implemented locally and, if they do, they rarely work.”  I intend to work WITH my fellow commissioners to come up with a plan that works for everyone.
  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a former director of the Modeling and Simulation Cell at the USAFA, I am fluent in statistical analysis methods and terminology.  In a former role a software product manager, I led the development of a performance analysis tool that leveraged data collection from front-line workers to provide intuitive insight into compliance and performance for managers using Tableau analytics.  My consultancy often uses advances analytics and surveys in the field to tell &quot;data stories&quot; regarding organizational performance and culture.  While I believe in the importance of data, I know that we must collect data with a purpose and that it must be actionable.  The data will tell a story, but that story must be confirmed in the field through engagement with our citizens to be valid.
