</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
With the intent of putting a stop to possible gerrymandering in Colorado, the voters empowered the commissions to conduct redistricting in 2018.  As a citizen and former government employee, I recognize that it is critically imporant to ensure that districts are representative of the electorate as population changes occur.  Colorado is expected to gain an additional Congressional seat due to the 2020 census due to our population growth.  I want to help ensure that the decisions regarding redistricting are based on the facts and logic.  In this first redistricting since the amendments were passed, I want to make a difference.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Throughout my career it has been necessary for me to promote consensus or agreement with otheres, ranging from co-workers to regulated entities.  It is a skill that I practiced and honed.  As an Assistant Federal Security Director (ASFD) I gained consensus from my subordinates when needed.  This included development of new inspection plans, revision to investigation report formatting and work schedules.  Many of the plans and policies we developed locally involved obtaining concensus from other local TSA Offices and/or TSA headquarters.  For example, I rewrote a major portion of our disciplinary process in Denver, and had to obtain consensus from the local TSA Human Resources department as well as approval by TSA headquarters prior to implementation. 

Throughout my career, most of my work involved regulating transportation entities.  Compliance with the regulations was usually determined through inspections.  I had to conduct fair and impartial inspections and ensure that my direct reports did so as well.  Based on inspection reports and other sources, we would initiate investigative reports to intiate civil enforcement action.   Our actions had to be above board for ethical and legal reasons, many of the regulated entities had Congressional contacts to who they could complain if they believed our actions were not fair and impartial. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As discussed above, as an AFSD, I conducted inspections as well as oversaw the conduct of inspections by my subordinates.  Inspecting a regulated entity required a high degree of logic and reasoning.  This included application the regulations to the transportation entity and figuring out logically what portion of the regulations pertained to it, how they could best achive compliance and actions needed if it refused or were unable to comply.  When enforcement action was initiated by my subordinates or me, we had to use a high level of analytical skills to analyze the pertinent regulations, the non-compliance and any corrective action that was or could be taken.  All conclusions and analysis of the facts had to be logical and well reasoned out.  Writing the final investigative report was usually complex and required application of logic and reasoning also to ensure the report was accurate and legally defensible. These analytical skills are transferable and would be of great value if I were selected as a commisioner.
