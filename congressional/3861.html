        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Diane Roberts</h3>

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have become more active politically over the last 5 years, primarily for the Democratic party, but also on more local levels such as advocating for the comprehensive sex education bill last year.  For the 2016 election, I attended the caucus and ended up as a precinct captain, representing Bernie Sanders as a delegate at the Arapahoe County convention and then at the Colorado State Democratic convention.  In 2018 I canvassed for Elizabeth Warren, and cured ballots for the 2018 election (through Arapahoe County Democrats).  I cannot recall all of my donations over the past 5 years, but the ones I am positive I donated to include campaigns for Sanders, Jason Crow, Warren, Amy McGrath, MoveOn.org, ActBlue, Vote.org, and whichever one was buying food for people waiting in line to vote last month.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
As noted above, I have volunteered with various groups through the Arapahoe County Democrats.  For my profession, I am a member of both the American Speech-Language Hearing Association as well as the Colorado Speech-Language Hearing Association (CSHA).  I have participated in a group of speech pathologists known as Denver Dysphagia Rounds, where we meet quarterly to present and discuss issues related to swallowing disorders.  I have been nominated to take over the leadership of this group, with responsibilities of finding and arranging speakers for each meeting, communicating the day and time, and setting up the online meeting as we have been doing since the COVID pandemic.  I was also recently elected as vice-president-elect of the education committee for the CSHA board.  My role there is to help plan the state convention for speech-language pathologists held in October, and to be a voting member of the board for other speech issues.  
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have good organizational skills, and attention to detail.  I have enthusiasm that I use to encourage all members of a group to participate in discusssion.  There are usually a variety of personalities and interests in a group that should be considered.  In my personal advocacy for the comprehensive sex education bill, I prepared a document showing questions from the actual test my daughter was given in high school, which was exclusively promoting abstinence.  I wanted the committee to see the real information being presented to the students.  For my professional groups, I try to consider the different setting that the therapists come from, because what you can do in a hospital is different than what you can do in a skilled nursing center or private practice.   For CSHA, the largest split will be providing topics of interest to people who work with the elderly in medical setttings as well as to those who work with children in schools.  During my political advocacy, I would tell people who would listen about what aspects of the candidate&#39;s platform were important to me and why, rather than just reciting talking points.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I voted for these amendments, and am very interested in redistricting FAIRLY.  I am not out to gain an unfair advantage, but I think the lines have been warped that way in the past.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I do focus on getting people&#39;s ideas and opinions out, and then working towards understanding or compromise.  I listen to people and treat them with respect.  In my career, I have worked with people of all races, socioeconomic classes, gender orientation, and disabilities.  I am successful in part because I relate to people on a personal level, not as a label.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In my career, I have to analyze the behavior and performance of people in different ways, to determine what is making the issue or problem occur.  I provide education and instruction to trial different methods of improving the issue, adapting the approaches as needed based on how the person responds. What works for one person does not always work for another, because people are different. I think it is important to make sure conclusions are reached using objective data and not just opinion.
