</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>

  80205
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have made donations to local candidates in the democratic party (I truly could not recall all of them), and I have contributed to the Biden campaign and to Diane Degette&#39;s campaign.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am on the Colorado Supreme Court&#39;s Law Committee (Bar Examiners) since 2016; I was formerly on the Federal Magistrate Selection Committee from 2013-2016; and am a candidate for the Faculty of Federal Advocates. My resume has a more complete list of these activities.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have attended fundraisers for candidate for Denver Mayor (Lisa Calderon), and my local representatives (Leslie Harod, and City Counsel member Candi CdeBaca). I have volunteered with the Colorado Spanish Speaking Lawyers committee to help folks with access to justice.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
We need folks who can understand the rural/urban divide. My folks live in the San Luis Valley; they ranch there and have been active community members with regard to water rights and land rights issues. I believe strongly that there are voices in rural areas that are not heard; it is time to change that. I also live in Denver; I understand and try to challenge &quot;gente&quot;-fication (that is, displacement of black and brown people from their own neighborhoods by upwardly mobile black and brown folks - it is not common but class is also changing our populations). I think redistricting should be about fairness in our changing communities, regardless if the community is rural or urban. We also have a huge problem with underrepresentation of black and brown people on these types of committees - we bring our perspectives, we bring our experiences, and we have something to offer here to make the process more equal.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My job is centered entirely around ordinary people - I am a plaintiff&#39;s trial lawyer. I talk to clients all day who have never had to hire a lawyer until they were injured. I like to hear what people have to say; what they have to offer; and, overall, I like to resolve conflicts. I litigate and try a lot of cases; this is a scary thing for clients, and I believe strongly in doing everything I can to resolve disputes outside of our courts. I mediate cases, I call other lawyers and we have to try to resolve cases on our own sometimes; I deal with adjusters as well who will try to resolve cases. My job is to create consensus and the best result for my client - which sometimes includes a bit of disappointment for all involved. I have applied in the past to be a judge in the 12th Judicial District in Southern Colorado. I have clerked for a judge (Justice Mullarkey of the Colo. Supreme Court). I believe in and advocate for fair outcomes in our judicial systems, and I&#39;d like to see that put to work in a political system that is in-fighting and tearing each other down. I am 40 years old, I have a young child who is 6, and I am married to an immigrant of a different faith. I resolve disputes and conflict at home as well! I think we could use more working parents on these types of committees - there is nothing like arguing with a 6 year old about bed time that can prepare you for deeply angry political conflict. I have learned more about conflict management since having a child, and I think it has made me more empathetic and willing to hear someone out completely to try to see our common ground. I&#39;d like to be part of this mission to promote consensus on this very delicate issue.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a lawyer all I do is pull the emotion out of everything I touch - it is like an inverted Midas touch. To make logical and reasoned arguments, the passion and emotion is drained, but it is nonetheless important to understand someone&#39;s perspective - facts are not without agendas. Persuasiveness is not without its rhetoric. I like to think I know how to do both as I try cases before juries and part of my work is to use both facts and emotion to convey meaning - yet remain professional.
