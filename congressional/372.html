<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Volunteered for Tablerock HOA as a committee member and lead to equalize HOA fees in our neighborhood. Poll watcher in primary 2020.  Participated in (Risk Limiting Audit)RLA for Jeffco elections after the primary 2020. I have volunteered to be an Election Judge in the general election.

Our HOA covenants was set up unfairly such that more than 1/2 of the community was paying more for HOA fees than others and the disparity was growing every time HOA fees were raised because of a covenant rule that a portion of the neighborhood should pay 1.5 times more than the other portion. The HOA fees are used for maintenance of amenities in the community to which all households have equal access.  I lead the committee to research (with the help of a couple of board members) how we could change the covenants and educate the community on how the HOA fees were used for assets to which everyone has equal access. We learned that we would have to have an election to add an amendment to remove the 1.5 times rule. 

I sent out polls for the community to vote on preferred methods of equalizing the fees. Although this seemed like an insurmountable task the poll indicated that 18 or 19 of the homeowners who were paying less would vote for the change to the covenants.  This was a sign that the task was not insurmountable and we proceeded with community meetings and presentations which I put together. Myself and the two board members presented the information. We held an election and my team and I canvassed the neighborhood to make sure everyone voted.  We needed 20 households that were paying less to vote for equalizing fees and increase their fees.  22 fair-minded neighbors voted for the amendment!  We are now in the 3rd year of our HOA fees being equalized across the entire Tablerock neighborhood.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that everyone should be represented fairly and I will be a strong advocate for that as demonstrated by my volunteer effort with Tablerock HOA. An independent team to perform redistricting is a great step in the right direction for fairly represented the people of Colorado. I would look forward to working with a team of people to achieve that goal.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I and the team were able to convince people that were paying less in HOA fees to see that it wasn&#39;t fair that some people were paying more for the same amenities. I was also able to communicate effectively with people that were upset over changing HOA fee covenants by listening, discussion, and outreach via researched information and meetings.  One of the more valuable skills of being a health coach is listening and supporting the client in their goals.  It often comes back to establishing clear goals and providing support to reach them.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My original and main career was in Computer Science as a software developer in Java and C/C++.  I worked as a team lead and applications architect for developing banking, financial, reporting, and project management software. My analytical skills are strong. (see attached resume for details).  I also have an MS in Landscape Architecture and Urban design which required a great deal of analytical work in mapping and design where I used Adobe software such as Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop to represent design proposals to a jury of faculty.

I&#39;ve attached a letter of recommendation for my most recent HOA volunteer work.  I can provide references from my previous careers upon request.
