<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Two statewide associations that I provide volunteer consumer advocacy for include AARP Colorado and League of Women Voters of Colorado.
As a volunteer advocate for AARP Colorado I participate in senior advocacy (age 50 and older), specifically representing that group as a stakeholder during Colorado legislative session. I follow bills, research, prepare positions &amp; make recommendations, which may involve my providing oral or written testimony at the legislature. My concentration is on bills related to health care systems &amp; affordability, Medicaid, Medicare, public pensions, as well as other issues such as affordable housing, utilities, financial security for seniors and the state budget.
Similarly as a volunteer advocate for League of Women Voters of Colorado I participate in advocacy at the legislature for bills they support, including providing oral testimony, and representing League as a stakeholder in legislative issues. Their issues include healthcare, mental health, juvenile justice, environmental issues, voter services as well as developing the redistricting legislation which led to the upcoming Redistricting Commission. 
I’ve been on multiple Speakers Bureaus, including for Bureau of the Census, AARP, LWVCO, LWVD. I’ve assisted groups in Southwest Colorado, in Durango and Grand Junction with access to remote testimony to the legislature. I’ve provided volunteer AARP Tax Aide services in the Denver/Aurora area to low income as well as to seniors.
As a property owner and with family in multiple jurisdictions of the state I have been involved in housing, land-use, real estate and other functions in Denver, Boulder and Durango.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The redistricting commission has the unique capacity to advance increasingly neutral and fair maps for a state based on geographic, demographic criteria and other criteria important to the state. The opportunity to participate in that outstanding opportunity is what appeals to me.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Working in voluntary non-partisan organizations like AARP Colorado and League of Women Voters Colorado has given me the opportunity to hear varied viewpoints and promote consensus at the grassroots level. In a commission role I would contribute experience in gathering input, using technology and research tools, and embracing the input around the state to conduct the work of the commission and produce the optimum maps for fairness and impartiality.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
With an undergraduate degree in Economics, a master’s degree in Administration, and a career in administration, finance, business, and operations, I am familiar with being presented with a variety of theoretical as well as real-live experiences with problem-solving which involved people (staff, clients, patients), space, budgets and varying viewpoints.
As a volunteer consumer advocate in my retirement, I am interested in addressing multiple viewpoints, reaching consensus and working toward win-wins.
I am comfortable with technical software and have experience with:
Researching online
Brainstorming
Writing
Communications-public speaking
MS Office
Spreadsheets
Presentation software
Tax software, which I used as a volunteer AARP Tax-Aide Counselor for many years
Educational software, e.g. Cornerstone on Demand
Social Media
Zoom Hosting, Presenting and other online tools
