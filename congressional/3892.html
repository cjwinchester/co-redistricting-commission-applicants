</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not donated to any political organizations.  I vote regularly.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I currently support and belong our neighborhood homeowners association and the Alzheimer’s Association. I support the Center for Health &amp; Hope Focusing on Global HIV and AIDS, I support and am involved in my church and presently help facilitate a class on racism. Although I am not a member of the Englewood Rotary Club, I support their functions and fundraising efforts .  (In the last 5 years my focus has been more of a personal nature with my husband having Alzheimer&#39;s and my mother moving in with me.)   However, these situations have become more manageable and I am now able to expand my scope of interest.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have volunteered to organize a swimming program for disabled adults through the Associated Students at CSU, I was a Citizens Advocate for a man with Cerebral Palsy and belonged to Civitan International.  I have been on the board for Rebuilding Together as well as the board for Denver Disabilities Coalition. I have facilitated support groups for people with spinal cord injuries and brain injuries. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
A friend in who is a Rotarian asked me if I was interested. I did not know or understand what this was all about until a second person, also in Rotary, (in our class that is studying racism), made a comment that the need still exists for commissioners for redistricting. They went on to say that it would be a good opportunity to actually do something towards fighting racism in Colorado. I believe this to be one of our Country&#39;s biggest issues at present and I would like to gain a better understanding of all marginalized citizens and try to make an impact on this. I researched this and attended the Q&amp;A and became even more interested in this opportunity.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a social worker my work was to offer emotional support and help people solve their problems, look for resources, point out and/or look for strengths and weakness that could either help or impede their progress toward change. 

As a counselor I have active listening skills that are essential when people are trying to be heard. With these skills I can hear a person’s point of view, value that point of view without judgement and remain impartial and strive for fairness with the other commissioners. Being heard develops a sense of trust that facilitates open communication with each other. I bring to the table a calm demeanor which often helps diffuse tense situations.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
            My analytical skill set includes prioritizing the issues, seeking a deeper understanding of the root causes.  Gather facts in a non- threatening way. Then action can be taken towards resolving the issue or problem.  Brainstorming with the team, being creative and exploring available options would be the teams next step. Or, recognizing an impasse and move to another issue temporarily. Often, just time, can be helpful as the team can then return to an issue with more clarity.
