<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In the 2014 political cycle, I assisted my friend, Janet Doyle, in her campaign for Colorado House District 25 by managing her financial records and filings. I have donated to a few campaigns since 2015, including Hickenlooper for Governor, Biden for President, and Carey Kennedy for Governor.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Chair of the Board of Directors, Great Education Colorado - 501(c)3 Advocacy for funding of public education Treasurer of the Board of Directors, The Bell Policy Center - 501(c)3 Non partisan policy research Member of the Board of Directors, Child Welfare League of America - 501(c)3 Non partisan national advocacy for vulnerable youth and families
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As CEO of Raise the Future since 2014, my time is spent organizing, representing, and advocating for youth in foster care and the adults that are helping them to heal. I do that work through constant listening tours with our constituents (kids and families) - and our partners (state and county agencies). We work hard to bring voices to the table through various means - not all communication styles are the same and not all constituents have the time to attend hearings or meetings. The most important voices are not always those who are the loudest or who come to the &quot;meeting&quot;. It takes enormous thoughtfulness and dedication to reach ALL constituents, hear their ideas, test your thinking and iterate through a process that brings cohesion to their voices, and infuses public policy priorities and actions with their voice. Most interestingly children in foster care and the families that serve those children (foster, adoptive, kin) do not represent a single political party or a single political point of view - their unity is around their passion for children and their hopes for their futures. In doing this work, I have traveled throughout the state - meeting with families and youth in every corner. In addition, I have met with county commissioners, heads of child welfare from Denver county to Rio Blanco and everywhere in between.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that the integrity and the neutrality of our electoral system is the most fundamental building block of our democracy - serving on the commission would feed this passion. In addition, I have a very strong consensus-building skill set that has weathered the work of building and running a large non-profit agency. This is a non-partisan, listening skill that is committed to bringing for the voices I represent, while building unity. I would like to be able to use that skill set in a way that gives back to my community in a non-partisan fashion; in something that builds up our democracy and does not take a side. I very much love looking at things from many different perspectives and pride myself on finding the middle ground. I think serving on the commission would be a fabulous way to use my skills and passions.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that consensus is built through a number of key strategies - all of which start with listening, validation and respect. My personal style is non-confrontational and supportive and I utilize evidenced based methods for bringing viewpoints to the table including models such as Motivational Interviewing. However, building consensus and a plan goes well beyond the starting point of listening - it has to move to action and the building a cohesive plan or output. To do this, I focus on both the ground rules for moving forward and the tactics for bringing ideas to the table. The ground rules determine how far we are willing to go as a group with each decision or step in the process. I utilize a scaling or rating system where each participate can identify where they are in their support (or disagreement) with a step and we determine ahead of time and what levels or scales of consensus we are willing to move forward. For the tactics of actually developing consensus, I most often utilize visual mapping where participants put ideas on small pieces of paper and we start to sort and prioritize them together - without attribution. This allows groups to see first the areas where we agree - both through the topics and the volume of pieces of paper. By owning and starting from points of agreement, we can then work outwards and draw ourselves wider and deeper. I view consensus building as trying to move hundreds of marbles across a room - as you move them forward, some will skirt off to the side (or ahead or backward) and you have to stop and nudge them back to the center before you can move the entire group of marbles forward. It is an iterative process that I love to lead and be a part of.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am a math and data geek at heart. With 10 years on wall street as an investment banker, an MBA from Wharton and years of CFO roles, I pride myself on my analytical abilities and devotion to the data and the numbers. This &quot;skill&quot; is apparent on my resume, however, the more important component is how you can bring these skills to practical real-world problems and tasks. Having successfully made the transition from finance to non-profit leader, I have demonstrated how to use analytics in ways that serve the common good.
