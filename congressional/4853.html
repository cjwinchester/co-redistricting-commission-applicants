<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a graduate of the Center for Creative Leadership, I&#39;m a huge advocate for &quot;Every voice at the table has a right to be heard.&quot; In 2014, as a committee member for Citizens for an Inclusive Wheat Ridge, I served as the Facebook Group Moderator. That was the year that I found my political voice. I took a stand and put my experience directing 50 for Colorado under the auspices of the Colorado Association for Commerce &amp; Industry (CACI) to work on behalf of citizens and business owners opposing a city ordinance. The measure failed. In a follow-up meeting, the Mayor attributed the failure to my efforts. Of course, this was far from reality. I was the voice for the group while other more significant volunteers knocked on doors and got the word out. 

In addition to CACI, I worked for the Governors Office of Economic Development, specifically for the Colorado Tourism Office (CTO) for the contractors, Publication Representatives WEST, Publication Designs, Weaver Publications and Miles Partnership. As a sales representative, I sold line listings to small businesses in the five industry sectors that comprise the tourism industry. It was my great privilege to represent the interests of this group in all facets of tourism product development and implementation. 

The daughter of a small business owner, I&#39;m a huge advocate for small business. For two years, I had a column writing articles featuring small businesses in the Wheat Ridge Neighborhood Gazette. I have an invitation to contribute to the newly-revived edition of the paper. Having turned my attention to assisting volunteer community organizations, I may switch my focus to featuring local non-profits. 

As a volunteer for Save Our Neighborhoods, I worked behind the scenes with administrative tasks. This group was successful in securing enough petition signatures to return the issue to City Council for a re-vote on amended zoning.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The reason I&#39;m completing this survey is because I want all voices in Colorado to be heard at the Federal level. Representation that is one-party-dominant, is the beginning of political disenfranchisement. The best decisions about governance and administration are made when &quot;every voice at the table has a right to be heard.&quot; Being heard includes listening and deciphering what is in the best interest of all parties, what is the common good. Politics in the United States is at a crossroads. If I can be a tiny part of insuring the best, most fair outcomes for citizens who vote in our elections, I would be most pleased to be of assistance.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I won&#39;t claim to be impartial. I&#39;m biased like every other person I&#39;ve met or talked to about politics. Bias is the underwater rudder that steers the ship. The most an opinionated person can do is 1) be aware of one&#39;s inclinations, 2) be willing to listen to what others have to say, 3) be on the look out for common ground, 4) think outside the box to try to find consensus, 5) be patient with the process, allowing participants to let new information sink in, 5) listen and solicit input from every voice at the table--introverts, extroverts, like-minds and opponents and 6) in the end stand firm on one&#39;s convictions having allowed those convictions to be informed by the process. I apply these principles to my leadership roles. I also know that decisions must be made. Redistricting decisions have huge consequences. I would most likely determine for which groups I would be the best advocate and would approach my role and contribution from that point-of-view.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I live with an emergency-room physician who&#39;s been trained to make life or death decisions/diagnoses within prescribed timeframes. His training was impeccable. His training also comes up short in other areas of life. We have many similar interests; at the same time, by training, life experience and expertise, our approaches to many things are vastly different. An extrovert to some extent, I&#39;ve had to learn to think two or more steps ahead. Being highly intuitive, I&#39;ve had to learn to keep learning. I&#39;ve had to learn to recognize and honor others&#39; accomplishments, expertise and ways of communicating. I&#39;ve learned to adapt my skill set to many functionalities but there is always the risk of not knowing enough or having blind spots. In the end, the best result is &quot;I did my best.&quot; My life motto is &quot;Always do what you say you will do&quot; and I would add &quot;to the best of your ability.&quot; I&#39;ve had three successful careers:  College Prep English Teacher; Basketball Coach in Indiana (Top Ten in the State, First Woman All-County Coach, 1978); Director of a VIP statewide business education networking program; Sales Rep with a statewide territory. Each endeavor required new thinking, new logistics, new learning, including my current position as Treasurer of a foundation. I&#39;m not sure what the challenges of redistricting would be. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve provided enough information to determine if I would be a good contributor to the task.
