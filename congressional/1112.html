<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I&#39;ve volunteered for a few different organizations and candidates and I&#39;ve been a candidate myself. In 2018 I ran for RTD District N and in 2016 I filed to run for House District 25 Representative but ended up supporting my opponent, Tammy Story in the election. 
I&#39;ve donated money to these organizations and candidates:
One Colorado
Jefferson County Democrats
Secretary Hillary Clinton
State Representative Lisa Cutter
ACLU
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Jefferson County Boards and Commissions, Citizen&#39;s Review Panel
One Colorado, LBGTQ Lobby Day Leader
Look Project, part of Chinese Children&#39;s Charities 
Reflections Art Juror for Jefferson County
Highway Cleaning with HD25 
Emerge Colorado
Mother&#39;s out Front (climate change and environment)
Moms Demand Action for Gunsense in America, state lead
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a member of the LGBTQ community One Colorado Lobby Day is one of my favorite volunteer days. I enjoy guiding citizens through the process of talking to their legislators about issues that concern them. 
As a gun violence survivor myself I made my role as state lead for Moms Demand Action a top priority. I spent 3 years organizing the state into action groups and helped pass significant gun reform laws in Colorado. 
I started an organization called the Look Project to help older children in China&#39;s orphanages, the children less likely to be adopted. I work  with government officials in China to advocate for education, clothing, and recreational needs of kids ages 7-18. Chinese Children&#39;s Charities now does a lot of the hands on work with Look but I still love my involvement. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I&#39;m a teacher and a single mother of 8 and I have a gift for being impartial and working with people of differing opinions. I&#39;m interested in exploring everyone&#39;s ideas and making sure everyone is heard. Finding ways to work together is so much more interesting than looking for differences. 
It&#39;s important to me to take part in many different areas of my community: the co-op art galleries, LGBTQ organizations, children&#39;s art exhibitions, and political volunteer work. Being involved in the construction of these districts will be a lasting investment for my community and I&#39;m excited to be considered for this important work.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Working across political lines is possibly the effective part of gun violence prevention for me. Guns and politics can be immediately polarizing and for me, gathering all the facts and ideas is a rewarding process. All sides aren&#39;t going to agree but I enjoy hearing from everyone. Some bills pass, others are maybe too extreme but keep them all coming. I do this in teaching, parenting, co-ops full of artists, non-profits. I&#39;m personally very liberal but one strength I think will work well for the commission is that I&#39;m not just willing to listen but I have a real interest in hearing and working on all sides.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a college professor I&#39;ve been able to modify my curriculum to turn my art classes, where hands on art creation is vital, into an online program during COVID.  I&#39;ve had to educate my students on the subject of art, but several times the assignments I&#39;ve asked my students to do have required me to teach them how to expand their creative abilities to use non-traditional art tools to create somewhat traditional art projects.
