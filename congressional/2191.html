<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am a Democrat and grew up in a Republican family in Pennsylvania. I have voted in every election since moving to Colorado, and first became politically active in 2008. Starting at that time, locally, my goal has been for all people who are eligible, to vote in every election. This is the very best way to attain the most representative government possible. While I have held various positions within the Larimer County Democratic Party, including Treasurer and Director for House District 49, none were elected offices in the last four years. Voter outreach to encourage civic engagement, getting out the vote during elections, and improving information for voters to use has remained the focus of my volunteer activities.
My political donation list is as follows. It includes the ACLU, school board and health district races, but does not include donations to non-political organizations I support such as the Food Bank of Larimer County, United Way, Homelessness Prevention Initiative, Save the Poudre, and others: ACLU, BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT, BUZZ4COHOUSE, CARY KENNEDY FOR GOVERNOR, CATHY KIPP FOR COLORADO, COMMITTEE TO ELECT GORDON MCLAUGHLIN, COMMITTEE TO ELECT JODY FOR COLORADO 51, FRIENDS OF MIKE WEISSMAN, JENA GRISWOLD FOR COLORADO, JENI ARNDT FOR COLORADO, JODY FOR LARIMER COUNTY COMMISSIONER, KEFALAS FOR LARIMER COUNTY, KRISTEN DRAPER FOR POUDRE SCHOOL BOARD, KRISTIN FOR LARIMER, LARIMER COUNTY DEMOCRATS, PEOPLE FOR A HEALTHIER LARIMER COUNTY, POLIS FOR COLORADO, YARA FOR COLORADO, YES ON NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE.

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Girl Scouts of American, Lifetime Member (past leader, past trainer)
Larimer County Democrats
Haumont Neighborhood Association, president
American Civil Liberties Union
Sierra Club
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
The best example I can give is through my work at Colorado State University. I’ve had the privilege to be a member of the Inclusive Physical and Virtual Campus Climate Committee, lead by the Vice President of Diversity, Mary Ontiveros. My work with this group began in 2013, and along with the committee grew into an effort which developed a policy and standards to make the University a more inclusive and equitable place on all levels to work and pursue an education. The process of developing a CSU policy that affects a broad spectrum of the community looked like this: develop a presentation of proposed policy, present to constituent groups (30 in this case), engage participants to provide feedback, listen, hear and learn from the participants, work in committee to decide on appropriate changes to the proposed policy, do follow-up work with constituent groups as needed, send policy forward for approval by president’s office. Inherent to this work is advocacy for many constituent groups ranging from students and faculty with disabilities, the LGBTQA community, adjunct faculty, students of color, employees whose pay rate barely meets a living wage, and many more.

It seems like the redistricting process will involve similar steps as I described above. The committee work of assessing the input and determining what would warrant an addition or change to the policy was substantial. I suspect in the commission, the input we receive from community members and groups would take a similar role in ascertaining how their information fits into defining a community of interest boundary and in placing a district line (along with all the other factors).

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on this commission because I care, and I have the experience needed in the commission to produce redistricting results which are at the heart of Amendments Y and Z. Now more than ever, we need balance in our legislative and congressional districts that make them both representative of their constituencies and politically competitive. I care very much that we make this happen in Colorado. It’s our best path forward. When a district is competitive, it is significantly less likely to vote in an extremist from either end of the political spectrum, and those elected to office are more likely to focus on producing useful legislation more moderate in nature that serves their district and Colorado as a whole. We all need this, and an independent redistrict commission has the potential for producing these results. My 35 years as a geographer and analyst will serve this commission well as it tackles the spatial problem solving and human dimensions of redistricting. Spatially bridging the urban-rural differences, maintaining a focus on cultural and economic communities of interest as a defining aspect of a district, while balancing the political competitiveness is not an easy task, but the results will be worth the hard work.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
One way to promote consensus in a working committee is to get off on the right foot.  Engaging 100% of the committee members in understanding the details of the goal and the guidelines on how we make decisions is a great way to set the groundwork and trust needed for consensus later. Being an active listener (and learner), is one way I feel I can assist in the good will of the group to build consensus. In addition to this, thinking outside the box, and brainstorming different ways to look at a situation (within the problem parameters) are ways I can contribute. I feel this approach assists in taking differing points of view and sheds a different light on the matter so it makes more sense or includes a compromise that all can live with.  Sometimes using a pros and cons list works, sometimes developing a rules base or a decision matrix works, and sometimes just talking it through goes a long way to reaching understanding and an eventual decision.

My role since the beginning of my career has been to take spatial information, analyze it, and present it in a form that is clear and understandable, then work with “specialists” (whether they were foresters, ecologists, or utility engineers) for the purpose of making a decision or solving a problem together.  On this commission, I feel that data-centered decisions are key. My lifetime of work by its nature in dealing with data to get accurate results requires a fair and unbiased approach. 

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Beginning with my work at TGS Technologies onsite at the Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of Indian Affairs Offices at the Federal Center in Lakewood to develop fire fuels models and land use classifications, through modeling regional utility outages at Miner and Miner Engineering, to grasslands ecological modeling of sequestered carbon - analysis of many layers of simple to complex spatial information is what I do in my work. Through my experience, I have learned how to focus in on what types of data layers and the level of resolution are to likely be most informative to solve a problem such as defining a district. 

I realize the redistricting staff will likely run the GIS software and create analysis outcomes and scenarios in coordination at some level with the commission’s direction and requests. One of the strengths I have to offer is experience in evaluating mapping outcomes.

Testing how much a final result (map) is affected by thresholding each contributing layer is often a good idea. Sometimes you find out big changes in an important layer do not make much of a change in the final result. In that case, you might want go back an look closely at how it is working to be sure the data has the appropriate number of category breakouts, or is detailed enough. Or maybe a weighting level is needed if it is key to defining a feature of a community of interest. Census data, while extremely valuable and deep, comes with its own set of issues. Because of the hundreds of types and variations of data (columns), it might be necessary to select several measures of employment or age or income and test out which fits best with the mapping we need to do.

Also, a certain level of ground-truthing is important if possible. Given that we will be doing site visits throughout the districts, and listening to constituents input, one idea might be to have a question or two that serve as a qualitative check for draft maps at that point to see if it seems our draft map(s) are on track with what we hear. 

I hope some of the information I provided gives you a sense of the logic and experience I can provide to the redistricting effort.
