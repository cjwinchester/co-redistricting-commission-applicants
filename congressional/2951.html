<p>

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
All sides must have the ability to express their points of view and have that acknowledged.   In my experience, differences come up, but so does common ground and shared values.  Focusing more on the areas of agreement, highlighting those and not becoming entrenched in the differences helps.   Being able to suggest novel approaches, while not focusing on being &quot;right&quot; or &quot;winning&quot; also helps tremendously.  In my career, I am often the mediator between two conflicting points of view between the manufacturer I work for and the customer I sell.  Getting them to see where the other is coming from and how compromise is in everyone&#39;s best interest rules the day.  Many times it is also about picking your battles, you are not going to get your way 100% or 100% of the time but you will get get something.   I do this everyday in my career, it is tightrope for sure but very rewarding seeing it come together.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have two examples of how I go about this, one from my days as Board Chair and the other from my professional career.
1) Board Chair - In this role I oversaw the Head of School (HOS) and the long term financial stability of the school.   The HOS came from a non-profit background while I am from the certainly for profit business side, two opposing mind sets on finances.  We hit a roadblock on the HOS contract around compensation and bonus, to be expected.  The rub was the HOS wanted over 90% of all funds distributed to HOS and Staff either through salary or end of year bonus.  While I was more focused on paying in accordance with norms and having financial reserves for long term needs.  Lots of discussion ensued.  I learned a great deal about the perspective of an educator and what makes them feel valued.  The HOS learned about long term planning and challenges on raising funds.   We had to balance the HOS desire to feel good about taking care of the staff through dispersing the money with responsible planning for the long term and stability.  The result was a formula based on enrollment and fund raising that had a lower salary than the HOS preferred but a larger bonus than I preferred.  The bonus was based on a reserve (rainy day) fund for long term projects and unforeseen events.  I was happy that the school would be secure and the HOS was satisfied the staff was treated fairly.  I have heard when COVID that planning paid off for them with no layoffs despite the shut down.
2 - Professionally -  Everyone wants to grow the business.  The manufacturer and the retailer, they both want to sell more.  However, what the retailer wants to pay versus what the manufacturer wants to sell for often come into conflict.  It sounds simple, but gets very emotional and a person&#39;s sense of what is &quot;fair&quot; frequently comes out.  I end up working with each party to get to the bottom of what is most important to them and focus on that issue.   Many times both parties need to be reassured that they are getting what they want in big picture and long term, but they may need to give up something in the short term.   Using language that always paints the other side as a partner and not an adversary is crucial while highlighting the gains each are receiving.  At the end of the day, both sides are dependent on each other and I bring them together highlighting this reality over and over again.
