<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am co-chair of Broomfield Health and Safety First (BHSF). BHSF successfully worked to pass Broomfield Charter Amendment 301 in 2017. Since the passage of 301, BHSF has worked giving input to the City and County of Broomfield on oil and gas regulations and other related matters. We also give input and testimony to the state legislature, COGCC, AQCC and other agencies concerning oil and gas, air quality, the environment and related issues.

I am currently on the Board of LOGIC Action (League of Oil and Gas Impacted Coloradans Action), a registered committee that supports state and local candidates, regardless of party, who protect communities and environment from oil and gas impacts while promoting clean and equitable energy solutions, and oppose candidates who do not support these objectives.

I have canvassed and written letters to the editor for candidates for the last 8 or 10 years and have made small donations mostly to local and state campaigns over the last several years.  

I have made small donations to political candidate and issues but the total since 11/10/2015 is less than $1,000. I can provide an itemized list if required.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I was the volunteer President of Sierra Retreats from 2003 to 2018. Sierra Retreats organized Buddhist meditation retreats with nationally known teachers along the Front Range.

I am a member of both the Broomfield and Colorado Democratic Parties

I have been an Election Judge for Broomfield from approximately 2016 to the present. I have verified signatures, retrieved ballots from drop boxes and voting centers, and participated in post election audits. Although this is a paid position, I view it as a community work.

I was a public member of the Emerald School Design Advisory Committee when our neighborhood school was rebuilt in 2017

I served as a volunteer Victim Advocate for the Boulder Sheriff for several years.


</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have been co-chair of Broomfield Health and Safety First (BHSF) since 2017. BHSF was organized to pass Broomfield&#39;s Charter Amendment 301 which prioritized health and safety in oil and gas development in the Broomfield community. In that capacity, and as an individual, I have provided input to the City and County of Broomfield (CCOB) on oil and gas regulations and related issues. I have also given testimony at Colorado legislative committee hearings as well as to the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) and the Qir Quality Control Commission (AQCC).

I have canvassed and organized others to canvas for political candidates.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Every Coloradan has the right to an equal voice, an equal vote.

Our state currently has reasonably good district boundaries, however, there are many who still feel they lack access to power. The redistricting process provides and opportunity for Colorado to increase the feeling of inclusion, and of being part of the wider community among all Coloradans.

I believe my background gives me a unique perspective and understanding of much that is unique in Colorado and of the wide range of experiences and struggles that face Coloradans. I worked in construction for 20 some years and was president of a company with over 50 employees. I also owned a small industrial screen printing shop in Longmont for 15 years until much of my customer base went overseas. I was even in a very small hobby business trading horses. My partner and I would buy horses along the Front Range and sell them to a riding stable in New Mexico. And of course I&#39;ve done the things that our state is known for: hiking and backpacking, skiing on snow and water, rafting and soaking in hot springs, Music in Telluride, retreats in Crestone, and enjoying fresh peaches on the West Slope in the Fall.  Each of those experiences has given me knowledge of, and insight into, different aspects of Colorado life.

I have lived in Colorado for over 40 years, raising my two sons in rural Boulder County. They both live in Denver now. Being multi-racial, my family also gives me a wider appreciation of Coloradans&#39; experiences. My sons are half Japanese and my daughter-in-law is Mexican American having moved to the US when she was a toddler.

I give you that background to show why I want to serve on the redistricting commission. I have known Colorado for a long time and I have seen great successes alongside difficult struggles. I know that Colorado has a great future that depends on the strength of Coloradans working together. A just and fair redistricting can do much to foster that sense of all of us working together as Coloradans.


</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe I have a strong sense of fairness mixed with an ability to find creative and practical solutions. My background includes managing a business with over 50 employees, running a non profit organization, and co-chairing an issue driven group. Each of these required working out solutions within the organizations and with other people and organizations.

I&#39;ve been trained in management, mediation and mindfulness. I am a good listener and like to delve into the way other people think which helps to flesh out ideas that may help create new solutions.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My degree is a blend of engineering and business from the San Jose State University School of Engineering with a minor in Psychology. My work as an electrical contractor depended heavily on analysis and logic and reasoning as did my printing business. Both fields, as well as the volunteer work I&#39;ve been involved with, also depended on blending or using that technical aspect with the human element. 

I believe I have a very good balance of both of those worlds, especially in the area of group decision making.
