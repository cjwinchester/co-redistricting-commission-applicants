<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am an energy economist and group manager of 18 staff (was 19 until recently) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, CO.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Tufts University and I have a Masters in Technology and Policy from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80228
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I donated money to the following politicians as they ran for office: Biden/Harris, ActBlue (for 5 key Senate races in 2020), Wisconsin Democrats, Clinton/Kane, Ed Perlmutter (U.S. Congressman (CO 7th district), Chris Kennedy (CO State Senate District 7), and Jefferson County Board of Education candidates. I also donate to the following organizations that I believe do lobbying: Southern Poverty Law Center, Amnesty International, National Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, Environmental Defense Fund, and the Union of Concerned Scientists.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am an active member of the Green Mountain United Methodist Church since 2005 and participate 4-6 times per year as a liturgist, I am a consistent member of bell choir, a participant in cultural excursions, an on-and-off member of choir, I helped create a women&#39;s faith-based book club that lasted 2 years, and I helped start the Church and Society committee that still exists today. I was asked to be the Chair of the Church Council starting in 2021, and will run the organization for 3 years to bring together all of our 25 committees; I will be the main coordinator across the committees so that we can further the work of our church. I was an active member of the Green Mountain Civic Association (Lakewood, CO 2005-2020) and I am now a member of the Solterra Homeowners Association (since Feb 2020), but activities are curtailed due to COVID. I am an active member of the JeffCo Democrat volunteer group that did phone banking this fall, and I participated in postcard writing to key swing states (2020). Previously, I have walked and knocked on doors to talk about candidates I support, or issues I support. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My best experience in this area is as a personnel line manager at NREL for five years. I identify opportunities for my staff&#39;s work to be communicated and championed within and outside of NREL. I organize the group to exchange technical information and also bring in outside speakers to educate us many times a year, I help my staff plan out their work and projects, and I organize regular lunches and happy hours. I represent my staff&#39;s concerns to higher levels of management and I represent NREL&#39;s policies and procedures to my staff; I also act as a representative of my directorate to the rest of the organization. I advocate for my staff as we assess promotions across my directorate and make the case for when my staff are ready for increased responsibility. Finally, I provide reviews of the quality of the work products of my staff - I identify inconsistencies, I craft language that is more concise and to the point, and I ensure that the results are presented in a fair and just manner that does not overstate what is found.  On the technical side (personnel management is 30% of the job), I also work with groups of stakeholders who are interested in a project from a variety of standpoints - I help them identify their core goals, to prioritize those goals, to talk about the goals of other interested stakeholders, and to identify the best path forward that optimizes everyone&#39;s goals.

I also consider the interests of organizations through active involvement with my church, where I actively participate in events that support Colorado groups and associations to support those in need. My church organizes and I participate in food drives multiple times a year to support the JeffCo Action Center (food for kids for the summer, Thanksgiving, Christmas) - in fact if the Action Center has a special need, they specifically reach out to my church because we will come through with donations - whether it is blankets, sleeping bags, first aid supplies, etc. My church also leads clothes drives and back to school supplies for kids in need, community pumpkin patch to support Habitat for Humanity in October, a Christmas gift program for kids in need, a Christmas sock and glove tree for people in need. When my kids attended church with me, I was active in the children&#39;s program as a Sunday School teacher, and a supporter of children&#39;s music programs (year-long), Christmas programs, and other children&#39;s events (Easter egg hunt, summer bible camp, etc.). I was a member of my kids&#39; School Accountability Committee (pre-2015) at Free Horizon Montessori in Golden, CO.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I very strongly believe in the American democracy - my late father said it is one of our greatest freedoms and responsibilities as U.S. citizens. As an adult, I wholeheartedly agree. I vote in all elections every year, because I want my voice heard and I know that local elections often have the largest impact on my day to day life.

It would be an honor to participate in this Continue Congressional Commission. My goal with participation is to identify a path towards consensus across the Commission for Colorado districts to make sure that the current and future diversity of Colorado is represented in the maps that are used for Colorado representatives in the U.S. Congress. I believe I have exceptional analysis skills that could help identify any potential partisan or non-representative issues with any of the maps. I also believe deeply in my communication skills such that I can help achieve consensus. This is very important work and I want to serve my state on this commission.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As an employee of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, it is my job to be fair and impartial. The work we do supports the objectives and goals of the current Secretary of Energy and the President, no matter the administration. Therefore we must provide credible, objective analysis and reports that support the goals of the current administration - NREL prides itself on being impartial advisors to federal agencies, foreign governments, and state, county, and local governments. We present the data and analysis and avoid making policy recommendations - we let the readers of our analysis take away conclusions based on the quantitative and qualitative results. If we are asked to examine a particular policy, we strive to point out the relative benefits and challenges of that policy. If we are asked to compare different policies, we will point out the relative benefits and challenges with each one, yet we will NOT make a recommendation about which the best policy. Our main client is the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and sometimes they come to us and are disappointed by our analysis results; we do not change the analysis results to match the current administration&#39;s hopes and dreams - we ensure that our analysis has solid footing and can withstand heavy scrutiny. Therefore, instead we walk the DOE client through the assumptions and calculation methodology - we explain why assumptions were made and the sources of those assumptions. In doing so, we gather agreement from the DOE client. Sometimes our DOE client will identify something that is surprising and offer an alternative input data set or approach. As an analyst, I will use active listening to make sure I understand what they are saying and consider whether their point is valid. If it makes sense and is generally supported with other sources, I will change the analysis and concede the point. Similarly, I believe strongly that honest communication among the commissioners will promote consensus and contribute to collaboration and agreement.  Since I have worked 13 years at NREL, I have a lot of practice promoting consensus and contributing to creating agreement among career government officials and political appointees.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Logic and analysis are my greatest strengths and are the reason why I became and engineer in the first place. I use both daily in my current job and have for my entire 24 year career. When I took the GRE for graduate school, the logic portion (1/3 of the test) was my strongest score (I scored 780 out of 800, which was the 97th percentile); quantitative was second (740 out of 800, which was 87th percentile). Also, I am a trained mechanical engineer. The foundation for the engineering disciplines are the identification of current and potential issues, and the identification and consideration of a wide range of potential solutions. Logic and reason are then applied so that the best solution that best meets the goal, within a set of specific constraints (e.g., cost, time), can be identified. In my professional career, I have lived in Excel and other specialty software programs for well over two decades. I am trained in seeing data patterns and identifying data inconsistencies. And with my experience as a consultant, I raise unique questions and see things from a different perspective. I am also an excellent written and verbal communicator and can help people understand what the analysis results mean, any potential issues, and the limitations of the analysis. 

For example, I have already thought about how I think the Commission can be run efficiently - I am not totally wed to this idea, but I have run many stakeholder groups, and would recommend the following process based on my experience. I understand the data scientists would have access to the Census data and would draw a series of maps for consideration by the Commission and the public. I think it would be important to: 
1) Hear a presentation by the data scientists on how they created the maps and key features of each. Allow time for Commissioners to ask questions during the presentation.
2) Be able to have at least a week to study their maps, including key demographic information for each of the maps (gender identify, political affiliation, total population, age,) - allow time for Commissioners to identify key questions (this allows introverts time to process the information and formulate questions)
4) Have one or more follow-up sessions with the data scientists where the Commission can ask more questions. 
5) Schedule public sessions, 3 in each Congressional District, to hear feedback and field questions from the public. Encourage a variety of people in each district to attend – different ages, races, genders, education levels, etc. Use a variety of times and day for each district so that we do not exclude someone based on their work schedules.
6) Debrief with the other Commissioners to make sure we heard the same feedback from the public. Capture this in a centralized document.  If there is a disagreement, capture both ideas.
7) I don&#39;t know if iteration with the data scientists on the map would be possible after the Commission reviews, or the general public reviews, but I would hope so. Incorporating feedback from the Commission and public will be key for finding the best maps.
8) Gather consensus and vote on the maps. Eliminate maps not of interest to anyone. Continue this process through a series of presentation and listening sessions where Commissioners communicate openly until we reach consensus, if not a unanimous vote on the recommended maps.
9) Send the consensus maps to the Supreme Court.

Therefore, I believe that my analytical, logic, and reasoning skills will be a direct asset to this Commission.
