        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for barbara ruth gunion</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  barbara ruth gunion
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Independent Business Intelligence Consultant currently in contract with Datateer. Not on resume is a part time position with the 2020 Census Bureau as an Enumerator.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have been working as an IT database engineer and business intelligence consultant for over 10 years. In 2019 I earned an IDELT 120 hour certificate for English Language Teaching. I am on break from volunteering as an assistant ELL teacher at Eloise May Library. My degree is Bachelors in Fine Arts from the University of Colorado in Denver (1997). I completed an internship at Asian Art Coordinating Council which involved writing press releases and helping to set up shows. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80112
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have volunteered for the Arapahoe Democratic Party from time to time since 2017. I also have been a co-captain for an organization called Sister District which is not Democrat but does support Democrat state house candidates across the country. I give small donor amounts to various candidates and groups. Most of it goes to local candidates. Some goes to causes or federal level candidates. 
Campaigns where I have volunteered:
Jason Crow
Amy Padden
Proposition 115
Nicole Johnston
Hillary Clinton

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Arapahoe Democrats, Sister District, The Learning Source, Code for Denver
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As co-captain for Sister District I helped recruit members and organized an event to introduce the organization to local volunteers. I advocate for the candidate by educating the people about what they support and how they will represent them. Primary responsibility as a Census Enumerator part is to educate and persuade reluctant people to fill out the Census. There are varied types of responses from not seeing the value to fear. My case success rate was over 2/hour which is very high. As a volunteer for English Conversation Circle I led group lessons which often including being an advocate for the United States and Colorado.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I would like to serve for both altruistic and personal reasons. Having fair district boundaries is important for a healthy democracy. I do not believe it is better to have one set of voices in government. All geographical areas and diverse people should be represented. I am excited to see how this progresses as an independent commission and I wish to be a part of it. 
On a personal level I have found that I enjoy working with the public. I also have close to a hobby interest in learning about the constitution and how it has shaped this country. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Agreement is critical to success. Recognizing and addressing the needs of areas outside your own builds an environment of trust and engagement. My experience as a consultant and teacher has taught me to look to the needs of the organization without involving my own bias except for personal understanding. I work with many different clients and businesses with different goals. I volunteer with diverse populations from all over the world. It is my position to be curious about their needs and respond with understanding while still grounded in facts. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have many year experience as a data analyst and engineer. One strength is my ability to troubleshoot and find solutions where it may not seem possible. To do this I take steps to understand and describe the problem, ask questions and then logically try out ideas. Sometimes you get lucky and there is one solution. Most of the time you need to decide on the best solution.
