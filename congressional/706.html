        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Ellen L. Ladley</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Ellen L. Ladley
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Maiden name;  Ellen Young</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Currently I am working for the County Clerk and Recorders Office as a Pollbook Judge.   This is new as I recently left my full time position as a Construction Manager with a large home builder.  I will upload my resume and you will see my involvement with homebuilding throughout Colorado.   I have seen extensive expansion and frankly am concerned but relieved that there is this commission.  A friend of mine told me about it.   I would be honored to support the commission with my efforts. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Masters of Science
Bachelors of Science

</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80501
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I have not been formally organizing any interest groups in Colorado.  I was a full time worker and single mom which took all of my time. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not ever been politically active other than voting
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
none
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Upon discovering this commission, I felt immediately drawn.   Having just leaving my full time job in the construction industry I am looking for something that would support community and/or state interests.   Having built hundreds of homes and seeing hundreds of people coming into Colorado, I cannot help but believe that a redistricting is needed; not to mention possible past gerrymandering.   Hence, I am applying for this position and would be honored to serve on the committee.   

In an effort to be honest with you I need to express that I am a common person who never really got involved with the parties or politics; other than voting.   I do not know what you are looking for.   I can tell you that I am ethical, interested, organized, results orientated, collaborative, objective and I listen really well to all people and treat everyone with fairness and concern. My job in construction was that of a problem solver, basically all day long, and I would like to carry that skill forward to a meaningful effort such as this. 

I do not have any letters of recommendation but can get you some if you would like me to.  I did not want to ask unless I knew this was even a possibility!   The letters would come from owners of businesses in the trades that I worked with.  They would tell you I am fair, kind and treat everyone with importance.  

Having lived in Routt County for many years as well as the Front Range has afforded me the unique experience  of the needs and the cultures of both areas. 

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
To be fair I believe it is important to listen to people with genuine interest.   All committee members need to have the ability to take each others interests and to collaborate interests and opinions among the committee.  

In this situation, problems need to be solved.   The problems need to be stated like a scope of work.  The problem needs to be analyzed by all involved and input needs to be heard.   Perhaps not everyones solution will be the determining point, but the most sensible solution needs to be the determination.  If needed, I can accept to let go of an opinion to determine the most sensible solution through collaboration. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I would keep the following in mind:

First analyzing a problem from variable possibilities and viewpoints is necessary.  
Taking effort into genuinely understanding the history as well as the pros and cons of the history of the situation to determine root cause issues is always helpful to me.    
If and then scenarios toward possible solutions and  results to each is a process I follow.   
Utilization of facts and data  available is important to uncover issues and situations.  
Then, craft solutions toward desired outcomes and results prioritizing results leads me to desired outcomes.  

In summary it is important the end point is reasonably thought out with data to back it up.
