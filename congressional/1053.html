</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Since November 10, 2015, I have donated to the campaigns of these individuals: Stephany Rose Spaulding, Cary Kennedy, Robin Kniech, Deborah Ortega, Jared Polis, Andrew Yang, Andrew Romanoff, and Joe Biden. I also donated to the 2018 ballot initiative, Healthy Food for Denver Kids. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Since November 10, 2015, I have served in the following capacities:
1. Civic &amp; Community Organization: Women&#39;s Foundation of Colorado
2. Volunteer Organizations: Board member of Buntport Theater
3. Neighborhood Association: West Highland Neighborhood Association

4. Appointed Board: Denver Sustainable Food Policy Council (Board and Commission of the City and County of Denver)
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have over 15 years of experience working in diverse environments/communities to create the conditions where numerous ideas and viewpoints were encouraged and expressed. I have experience organizing and building consensus around food security issues. Specifically, I worked with Denverâ€™s City Council to pass the Fresh Produce and Cottage Food Sales Home Occupation Ordinance and to support the creation of a new, permanent position (the Manager of Food Systems Development) to coordinate and evaluate food-systems related activity. At the state level, I used a nonpartisan approach to build a diverse coalition of urban and rural agricultural stakeholders to amend a state regulation. Finally, I have served as a volunteer and facilitated conversations with grant reviewers to prioritize and recommend projects for funding; this process was based on a consensus model and outcomes reflected the will and intentions of all participants.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
One of the most important parts of a functioning representative government is ensuring that the people are accurately counted and represented. I believe that this process can and must be carried out fairly and with great attention to detail. We are at our best as a state when we reflect the great diversity of those who live, work, and play across Colorado&#39;s many terrains and environments. I would be honored to serve on this Commission, in service to all Coloradans, and give back to my home state. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The responsibility of this opportunity cannot be understated. It is with gravity that I apply to be a Congressional Commission member. In my professional experience, I am known by my peers to be fair and impartial. I take great pride in this. In my many stakeholder engagement roles, it was my true mission to listen and understand the perspectives of everyone and then to reflect that in my communication. Whenever I was unsure of what someone was trying to communicate, I would repeat back what I thought that I had heard and then ask for verification, either way, as to if I was understanding and communicating accurately. 
Finally, during my time as co-chair of the Denver Sustainable Food Policy Council, I actively facilitated engaged discussions that often culminated with a consensus vote. I love the diversity of Colorado voices and the many experiences and traditions it represents. I would be honored to serve on the Congressional Commission and if appointed, will be fair, impartial, and nonpartisan. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am analytical by nature, have an appreciation for context, and am able to understand issues from multiple viewpoints. Throughout my professional career, these skills have helped me advocate for food security and recycled water policies that had buy in from multiple sectors, agencies, and scales of agriculture. When I have worked in partnership with agencies and organizations to collaborate on projects, we were often successful; one reason for this was the ability to break our goals down into decipherable actions and clearly state how we intended to reach our goal. Circumstances may have dictated that we veer from our initial approach, but we were able to take it in stride as we were previously well prepared and collectively understood how to jointly meet our shared goals and desired outcomes.
