</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have volunteered at the grass roots level in various political campaigns in Colorado starting in 2008, primarily to encourage voting.    I have attended lobby days in the state legislature on behalf of Planned Parenthood and Everytown for Gun Safety.  In 2013 and 2020, I was involved with efforts to repeal the death penalty in Colorado and testified as a murder victim family member in front of various state  legislative committees.  As treasurer of several arts-related small non-profits, I have worked to provide timely and useful financial  information and helped guide members to use that data to make responsible financial decisions.  In various leadership positions at High Plains church, I have worked to be a responsible steward of community resources, to increase communication and understanding of budgetary issues, and to implement policies and practices that improve operations. 

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
From 1987 until 1997 when I became stay-at-home parent, I worked as a defense budget analyst for the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office in Washington, D.C.  As a result of that work, I became committed to the idea that public officials should have access to the best information, gathered without respect to a political agenda, in making decisions.  Since that time, I have watched with increasing dismay as political bodies at all levels of government have become steadily more polarized, unwilling to work together, and willing to take advantage of questionable practices, such as gerrymandering, to ensure their own survival.  I believe Coloradans are committed to turning away from such a path, and the legislative redistricting commissions promise to be a key component of that effort.  

As a Democrat in CD 5, in 20 years I have never been represented by an elected official from my own party, and have been particularly appreciative of local officials who take the trouble to conduct town hall meetings and other activities to hold themselves accountable to their constituents.  If districts are drawn fairly, my hope is that more elected officials will work harder to serve all the voters in their district, not just the ones of whose votes they are assured.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
On this commission as in other areas of  my life, I will seek to establish common ground with those who may disagree with me.  I will listen carefully to arguments on both sides and work to address issues with an eye toward thoughtful and effective government, rather than political agendas or knee-jerk responses.   In the many organizations in which I have volunteered, I have endeavored to ask the hard questions and encourage other leaders to consider all sides of a questions before making a decision. As a parent and grandparent I have worked hard to model fairness and even-tempered behavior in my family and community, and I believe these same skills will be useful in working with members of the commission.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My relevant skills include experience reading and analyzing legislation, as well as working with complex models and datasets to solve a wide range of problems. I have considerable experience analyzing data, both in my working life where I provided cost estimates for legislation in the area of national defense, as well as on numerous non-profit boards where I have worked hard to present information in an understandable way to others in the organization so that together we could arrive at workable solutions.  My training in organizational behavior has helped me to learn to gently push groups out of a place of fear or denial and into a space of problem solving and optimism.
