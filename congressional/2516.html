<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Beginning in 2009 I chaired the South Metro Denver Health Care Policy Task force.  Our task force wrote a proposal for consideration by Colorado&#39;s 208 commission on healthcare reform.  This proposal was later written as legislation that was presented in the Colorado legislator in 2009 and 2010.  We worked with business and community organizations and health care trade associations to articulate the significant issues in our healthcare system.  This advocacy for rational reform in healthcare, which would actually reduce the cost of the system, and the cost in the system to governments, business and individuals, has been revived this year.  In 2010 I cofounded and chaired the Coalition for Effective Healthcare a 501C4.  In 2012, at the request of the South Metro Chamber Board of Directors I wrote a white paper on the significant challenges for business of Colorado&#39;s very complex sales tax system.  That white paper was presented to the then Colorado State Senate President.  That led to my personal advocacy with mayors, DOR and some legislators.  Ultimately, after soliciting the involvement of American Furniture Warehouse and Colorado Automobile Dealers Association, we interested businesses and trade organizations in joining the effort to fix Colorado&#39;s Sales Tax System.  We formed the Coalition to Simplify Colorado Sales Tax.  The Coalition, working with legislators, has participated in the writing of and advocacy of 5 bills that have all passed the legislature and are step by step moving Colorado toward a far more user friendly sales tax system, that is revenue neutral, at worst, and very well may generate more sales tax revenue for the state and home rule cities.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been very involved politically in Colorado since 2008 when I chaired the Arapahoe County Romney for President effort and chaired the state&#39;s volunteers for Romney for President in 2012.  I have been directly involved with campaigns for Steve House - Congress 2020, Doug Robinson for Governor 2018, Cory Gardner US Senate 2014, Bob Beauprez Governor 2014.   I have donated to multiple campaigns and am an annual donor to the Arapahoe GOP and Colorado GOP.   Campaign donations - Steve House, CD6, 2020, Cory Gardner, US Senate 2020, and 2014Kathleen Conti, Arapahoe Co. Commission 2020, Mike Coffman US Congress 2018, 16, 14, 12, Bob Beauprez Governor 2014, Trump for President 2020, Romney for President 2008 2012, Steve Daines Montana, US Senate 2020, John James, Michigan 2020, US Senate 2020, Kim Klacik, Maryland, US House  2020

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Because I am interested in fair elections, I understand well our election system.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my sales tax simplifications advocacy I have met with and been in meetings with all stakeholders in the sales tax system - the Coloroado Department of Revenue, Colorado Municipal League, individual Home Rule cities, counties, Colorado legislature, business trade organizations and individual businesses.  We were able to listen, respond to disparate interests, find common ground and common objectives and move the ball progressively toward a much better sales tax system for the state of Colorado.

With my healthcare reform advocacy, we engaged political leaders, business organizations, and even healthcare trade associations.  This is a really difficult issue to rally interested parties toward a common solution.  The actual fix to the healthcare system problems, is not that challenging.  Aligning the various players is very challenging.  The businesses of healthcare themselves are the most difficult to move as the American Healthcare industry is the largest industry on the planet with significant players who have a major financial stake in the structure of our system.  We were able to achieve alignment with many at the table including advocates for a single payer healthcare system, with whom we found significant common ground.  As part of my work in this area, I was a significant contributor to the legislation that enabled the Colorado healthcare insurance exchange.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am a business owner and prior to owning my business, was the Colorado senior executive of a company with 650 Colorado employees.  I have consistently in my life faced challenges that required analysis, consideration of multiple courses of action, developing strategic direction and decision making and implementing strategic plans.    We have successfully navigated very difficult situations.  2008-2019 was very difficult for most businesses.  We were no exception.  We developed strategies to navigate our business through a significant recession.    the shutdown of much of our economy as a result of Covid 19 has brought a whole new set of challenges that required fast assessment of the looming problem, multiple options to address the business challenges, selecting a go forward set of plans and implementing it.  Our business has been dramatically impacted by Covid.  Today, we have as many employees as when the pandemic first resulted in stay at home orders.  Our outlook for the future is strong as we have made and implement many decisions that have preserved our company and positioned us for future prosperity.
