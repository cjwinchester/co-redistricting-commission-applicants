<h3>Background</h3>

</p>

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have been involved in supporting efforts seeking to promote diversity and true inclusion in my community for years, through Facebook-based community support groups (sharing information, resources, donations, etc) though I haven&#39;t been an active leader. In my role as babywearing educator, I have long advocated for inclusive language and options at our meetings as well as making our teaching and lending library truly accessible to all who need it. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My kids no longer need me home at all times, but I haven&#39;t yet gone back to work, so it seems an ideal time for this opportunity. I have been for the idea of fair/impartial voting districts ever since I learned of gerrymandering when I was young. Voting is one of the most basic means of expressing our preferences and beliefs, and it should be both universally accessible and each person&#39;s vote should hold weight. This is an important and historical opportunity to shape the future in our state, and to (continue to) set an example for the country as a whole when it comes to voting.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I grew up in rural North Dakota; my parents were registered Republicans. Then I came to Colorado, and attended the Air Force Academy, and served in the Air Force for 8 years. During that time, and even mores in the years following, as I was exposed to a wider variety of people from divers backgrounds, I began to unpack and dismantle my long-held inherited beliefs and rebuilt them in a way that was more in line with how I now understood the world to be. I shifted dramatically towards progressive beliefs without referencing/looking to the Democratic Party, and I remain unaffiliated. I have friends/relatives from all parts of the political spectrum, and because I come from a conservative background I can understand where their ideas are based and why they think as they do, even if I will never agree with them. I have lots of experience discussing various divisive topics in a way which delves deeper than surface rhetoric and looks to causal factors and deeper motivations, which can help shift understanding of an issue. When I am gathering information and working towards a goal, the information is the most significant factor - it drives the pathway, not the other way around. I am able to see things from various perspectives at once, and use that to challenge my own views as well as set aside my views temporarily. I am also excellent at leading discussions, and helping to step others through a structured/productive decision process and ensure that where we are going is going to get us to where we want to be. Many friends have reached out at decision points in their lives, as they know I can help them to clarify and drill down and that I will focus on their goals and not my own perception.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I was an intelligence officer in the Air Force and studied analysis and logical fallacy as part of my masters program. Analyzing and problem solving is intrinsic to my life; I seek out opportunities to use these skills if they aren&#39;t needed in anything I am currently doing.
