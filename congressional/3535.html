        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Emma Gillian Williamson Grant</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Emma Gillian Williamson Grant
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Gillian Grant, Emma Grant</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I currently work for a public health nonprofit called Trailhead Institute. I am the program manager for a statewide workforce called the Regional Health Connectors.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  - Bachelor of Arts in Sociology, graduated from CU Boulder in December 2005
- Master&#39;s in Public Health, graduated from CU Anschutz in May 2010, focus in Community and Behavioral Health
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80206
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
 I have been a registered Democrat for over 10 years, and have voted in many local elections, primaries, and both the 2016 and 2020 presidential election. I also voted overseas for the 2008 election.  This year, I volunteered for a few &quot;Get out the Vote&quot; campaigns. I made phone calls to registered Democrats in Pennsylvania to encourage them to vote (regardless of who it was), as well as texted voters here in Colorado asking them to share their voting plans.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
YMCA advisory board, Schlessman branch, Denver
Standing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ)
Colorado Public Health Association (CPHA)
CPHA Health Equity Coalition 
Warm Cookies of the Revolution
Denver District 8 Democrats 
CO9to25 (has dismantled)
Court Appointed Special Advocate of Metro Denver (CASA)
Volunteers of Outdoor Colorado
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I am currently serving on the Health Equity Coalition for the state of Colorado run through the state public health association (CPHA, see question above). I am a white woman, so can not speak for folks of color, however I can advocate for their community and health needs as I hear them through my work. I am managing a statewide workforce of 20 people who live in regions throughout the state, they are called Regional Health Connectors (RHCs). RHCs work to connect primary care, public health, and community assets together to promote overall health for their communities. They have many local level stories to share about what is needed for their communities, and I am able to use what I hear, bring to a statewide committee and advocate for better health resources for them, ultimately leading to more awareness of issues and community needs, as well as who to reach out to in the community to support. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Fair maps that greater represent the diversity of Colorado&#39;s people, places, and communities are needed to create more equity among communities across Colorado. More voices need to be heard and represented in the Congressional districts, and I can bring forth my own knowledge of what is needed in diverse communities across Colorado because of my work at a state level. Further, this will give me an opportunity to use my knowledge of geography and allocation of health districts in the state, aggregated by statistical and demographic data.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Being fair and impartial can be challenging, particularly because we as humans have a tendency to hang strong to our own personal beliefs and values. However, I have learned to practice empathy and listening to understand others perspectives and where they come from. Because my work has been to manage a statewide program of diverse folks who come from many Colorado communities, I have needed to practice listening, understanding, and validating everyoneâ€™s experiences equally. Despite our differing views, I have learned to understand where folks are at, and create inclusive spaces for folks for them to also understand my experience. I would use this skill to present all sides of what comes up in the redistricting process, and promote an understanding of all sides so that we can find common ground where we can agree.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Throughout my grad school experience and career, I have had to use many critical thinking skills. My strongest skills that I use are collaboration, brainstorming, and planning, particularly around calls to action for health equity in communities in Colorado. I am able to use qualitative and quantitative data to create a picture of what the problem is and what is needed to solve that problem, a useful skill for this committee.
