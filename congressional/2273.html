<h5>Occupation</h5>

</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>

</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80521
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am a registered democrat.  I have given money to the Clinton Campaign in 2016 and the Biden Campaign this year.  These were only small donation of $20 contributed 4 to 5 times over the months of the campaign period.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>

I taught bible study at Bethel Baptist Church until our pastor left and COVID-19 happened.  I volunteer at various local schools to support teachers and children.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As an educator, I organize teachers and students daily and have done so for many years.  I am accustom to working with people from all walks of life, from superintendents, principals, and directors to immigrants, and homeless members of society.  I have worked across the lines of division to bring different voices into a productive discussion.  I believe in developing professional relationships based on a sense of trust and rapport.  As an instructional coach and educational leader both in Greeley and Loveland, I represented all of my teachers across the district, as well as families and students from diverse backgrounds.  My approach is to seek understanding, apply logic and reason, and make decisions based on facts that will positively impact the most people.  I love questioning for understanding and always bringing a positive, can-do attitude to everything I do.  When I have worked on various board, I attempt to be a thoughtful member who listens first, asks questions and reflects before giving my input (&amp; only if needed). 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As I am coming into my final years in education, I am eager to use my skill set in an innovative way as a committed public servant who seeks to better our community and state.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe consensus and collaboration are partners in decision making. Consensus is the give-and-take of information sharing. It&#39;s the ability to discuss differences calmly and come to some form of an agreement. By discussing differences in opinion, new ideas are free to surface. Consensus involves reaching an acceptable agreement in a manner that respects others.  It involves appraising competing ideas, contradictory statements, and dissimilar points of views; however, by the end, a satisfactory agreement is reached honoring the differing ideas without degrading others involved in the process.  I employ something called the 4 agreement: #1-Be impeccable with your words (use your word choice wisely &amp; never question a person motives or honor) #2- Don&#39;t take anything personally #3- Don&#39;t make assumptions (for this leads to conflict) #4- Always do your best (&amp; know that others are trying to do their best too). I use the 4 agreements to begin meetings, which helps all members know the expectations that spring out of a foundation of respect.  I add humor to my approach and usually people will come together because they know we all are working to make a positive difference.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Let&#39;s first begin with my definition of logical reasoning.  It is the process of analyzing a situation and coming up with a sensible solution.  It requires one to study a problem objectively, make rational conclusions (based on evidence) and then use the fact that are available to address the situation or problem.  I have led many educational teams with competing ideas and diverse backgrounds. I like to use discussion protocols to get every voice in the room and then begin to identify common linkages or areas of common ground.  In the areas where there are difference, I like to question to better understand the why behind ideas.  Again, I apply the 4 agreements to manage feelings and talking points with the goal of honoring all voices in the room.  In the end, by developing professional relationships based on a sense of trust and rapport, people will come together as they feel honored and heard.
