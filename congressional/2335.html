<h5>Zip Code</h5>

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not been involved in party politics. 
In 2020, I donated money to the Biden/Harris campaign, the Hickenlooper for U.S. Senate campaign, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
In 2016, I may have donated money to the Clinton for President Campaign.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
In 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, I rejoined, after retiring, the American Medical Association, the Colorado Medical Society, the American Psychiatric Association, and the Colorado Psychiatric Society.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Outside of my work, I do not have experience referenced in this question. However, in my 35 year career as a physician in Colorado, the last 31 as a psychiatrist involved in direct clinical care, I worked with and advocated for the best possible care and treatment for those suffering with severe mental illness, and for their families. This included much education with consumers and their families, as well as teaching classes for families and other interested community members, regarding major mental illnesses. As well as providing care, treatment, and education, I always sought, as part of my mission, to instill and foster hope.
Additionally, I am a member of NAMI - the National Alliance on Mental Illness.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I strongly believe in the concept of fair nonpartisan congressional districts, and believe this is a crucial element to minimizing &quot;gridlock&quot; in our U.S. Congress.  Colorado can now be a leader in advancing the policy of nonpartisan commissions, rather than elected politicians with partisan interests, to create fair and balanced congressional districts. I would be excited, honored, and proud to be part of this process.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In both my personal and professional life, I have always prided myself on getting people with opposing points of view to come together, improve communication, compromise, and ultimately work out a solution. 
For example, from 1988 through 2010, I held a joint position with both Mental Health Partners (then Boulder County Mental Health Center) and Colorado Mental Health Institute at Ft. Logan, with my time equally divided at each location. The most difficult part of the job was not direct patient care, but rather getting the two agencies to work together. Before I took the position, I was told by many that it would be an impossible job because of the animosity between the two agencies related to different treatment philosophies and disagreements about how long patients should remain in the hospital. Many said I would ultimately have to choose sides, and that the standoff would therefore continue. Patients and their families were caught in the middle of what had become a grudge match, with neither side willing to budge. Most of the disagreements were over the phone. Because I worked at both locations, I was able to develop professional relationships with the staff at both agencies. Almost all were well trained and well intentioned, but too often saw each other as rivals and, in some cases, had contempt for each other, rather than working cooperatively for the good of their patients.  After gaining the trust and respect of staff members at both locations, it became possible to bridge differences and work cooperatively. More importantly, once the ice was broken, staff at the community mental health center and staff at the hospital gradually began to talk respectively with each other. Instead of accusations and talking angrily at each other, conversations turned back toward clinical problem solving and working together. As a result, the logjams eased and patients improved more quickly and were thus able to return home more quickly.

By doing my best to be fair, to listen, to be respectful, and to be impartial, I was able to be seen in this light by both sides (according to feedback that I received) and thus was able to be more effective at my job.  If selected for this position, I would do my best to bring this spirit to the commission. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
When approaching a task or a problem, I try to collect as much data as possible, to not reach premature conclusions, to listen respectively to both sides or all points of view, to minimize emotion and maximize a &quot;pro and con&quot; approach, and only then reach a deliberate and reasoned decision or recommendation.
