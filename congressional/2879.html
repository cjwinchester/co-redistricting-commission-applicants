<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
1972 - Selected as Core Staff for planning the opening of a new school - Birch Elementary School, Broomfield, CO - 1982 - Selected as Core Staff for planning/opening a new school - Broomfield Heights Middle School, Broomfield, CO
1975-1979  Teddy Roosevelt YCC Camp Director in charge of operating a 5 day residential camp with 40 - 15 to 18 year old youth (half girls, half guys) and a staff of 13.  The camp ran throughout the summers tasked with the job of trail building and a variety of environmental work, and environmental education of our enrollees.  Planning with staff evening activities for 4 nights each week, safety for all, plus overseeing the operation of the kitchen, etc. The single largest work area was trail and bridge building in the Brainard Lake area.  Other work was done along the Peak to Peak highway from the counties of Gilpin, Boulder, and Larimer.  1980 - 1988, I was hired to construction and built the trails and out facilities for the  Cal-Wood Education Center above Jamestown using youth earning restitution (per court order) as my work crew.  I would pick them up in Boulder using a school bus and drop them off later that day, 5 days a week.  Work safety considerations were always considered due to differing abilities and ages.  I have also spent summers as an educational leader working with teachers across the state under the direction of NOAA and NCAR on and off during the 1990&#39;s.  The list goes on...  
(I did not apply for either of the jobs as YCC Camp Director or Cal-Wood.  Eddie Owada called me in March 1975 while I was teaching at Birch Elementary and offering me the job as  Teddy Roosevelt YCC Camp Director.  Apparently, he had received recommendations from the Ed Center thus getting my name.  Eddie was employed by the US Forest Service during that time.)  While at a Boulder Valley District meeting at the Ed Center, I was approached by the Executive Director for the Cal Wood Foundation.  He stated that he was sorry to see the funding for the YCC program cut and asked if I would like to work for Cal-Wood.  I had had his son in my YCC camp in the 70&#39;s and that was how he knew me.)

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My wife and I moved to Boulder, CO in 1970 from Illinois because we loved Colorado, it&#39;s people, and it&#39;s lifestyle.  I am retired but strive to keep physically and mentally active.  It is my love of the state for which I wish serve keeping it&#39;s history, diversity, and natural beauty for future generations.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have taught middle level (6-8 grades) science for 42 years (41 years for Boulder Valley School District and specifically in Broomfield)  During that time Broomfield&#39;s demographics drastically changed as surrounding communities&#39; housing costs became prohibitive for many causing a wide diversity of students.  Besides working with youth, I have actively worked on a variety of committees throughout Boulder Valley School District as well as conducting a variety of teacher training/inservices primarily in science education also in Boulder Valley School District, as well as participated and presented in summer institutes at NOAA and NCAR in Boulder 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My Science classroom was based on the concept of &quot;Hands On Minds On.&quot;  Books were rarely used as I was an activity based classroom.  In 1988, I received a $22,000.00 grant that I used to bring in a series of microcomputer labs into my classroom using data collecting instruments to collect data on heat, sound, motion, etc. enabling studens to draw their own conclusions regarding their task at hand.  Another station had visual images of photos on a CD Rom disk ( received from Ball Aerospace) from Voyager&#39;s fly by the planet Uranus. Students were asked to hypothesize and respond to questions at this station.  My grants allowed for the purchase of a computer for each science classroom to begin using a computer based grading system which later became used by all BHMS teachers.  Another grant purchased an 8 foot satellite dish for BHMS.  It was used by foreign language classes to view TV programs in French out of Canada and Spanish TV programs from Mexico, etc.,  Science classes used the dish to access NASA, viewed space shuttle launches, and other real time scientific information from government sources.  I taught analytical skills and taught students how to apply logic and reasoning to problems presented to them.  This is how I personally learn and throughout my career tried to teach my students over my 40 years of teaching 6th grade Science.  (2 years teaching 8th grade science)
