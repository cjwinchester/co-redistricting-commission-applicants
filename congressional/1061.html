        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Daniel Ricardo Angeles</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Daniel Ricardo Angeles
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Dan Angeles</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I work at St Francis Medical Center in Colorado Springs as a Nuclear Medicine Technologist, I have worked at this job since August of 2008.  I also work as PRN at UC Health in COS, and have done so for the past three years. I will upload my resume when prompted. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have an Associates degree in Nuclear Medicine Technology from Ferris State University located in Big Rapids, MI.  I graduated in 2008, and moved out to Colorado later that year to start my career.  Shortly after graduation, I obtained my NMTCB certification for my job.  I am also BLS certified.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80921
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am an unaffiliated voter.  I have always felt that being affiliated to one party is not always what it best for the community in which I live.  I have not worked with either party, or made donations to either.  My only true experience in Colorado government was in 2015 when I served on a Colorado Grand Jury for a total commitment of 18 months, 4 to 5 days each month.  This was truly an amazing experience.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am a husband and a father of four children so I am very deliberate with my time.  My current volunteer work is with...

-Landsharks running club as a head coach for Mountain View Elementary Schools K-5 cross country and track programs.
-Mountain View Elementary School WatchDog program (Dads of Great Students)  
-My neighborhood HOA, Deer Creek.  I help organize youth activities, our latest, the community 4th of July Parade.  

I would devote more of my time for a worthy cause.  
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have a healthcare background, and my only advocating and volunteering is thru my hospitals educational programs and my children&#39;s school.  Through my job I promote an active and healthy lifestyle to prevent cardiac disease.  I do this (pre COVID) by going setting up tents or stands at community events to help the community learn more about prevention of cardiac disease.  For my children&#39;s school I volunteer as the head cross country and track and field coach, as well as volunteer in the schools WatchDogs Program.  I have always been interested in taking on larger roles, I just was not sure how to get involved.  When presented with the idea of serving on a redistricting commission, I knew this could be a great opportunity to get started in a new realm.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Back in 2018 I did in-fact vote to pass both Amendments Y and Z because I liked the positive change that could come from them.  As an unaffiliated voter, I feel I would be able to look at what is best for our communities as a whole, as opposed to looking at what would benefit a specific political party.  I love Colorado, and definitely love the community in which I live and since both Amendments passed with such a large majority, it means I would be helping enact change that Colorado truly wants. I would be honored to be able to serve on a commission that I voted to create.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The commission was designed to be a group of people, not one individual or one individual&#39;s opinion.  In my career, and in life in general, I have found that multiple minds and perspectives are far better at solving problems than one single mind. A group also helps keep each other accountable. I feel the best way to create agreement and promote a fair consensus is to first agree upon a set of standards and guidelines (be it geographical, socio economic, an areas specific needs, or by a political majority of an area) and then stick to it, whatever guidelines are agreed upon, we should then prioritize them before starting.  I would take into account how the majority of a district votes, and make sure gerrymandering isn&#39;t taking place.  As for being fair and impartial, I am not affiliated with either party.  I would always want to keep each communities voices as a top priority, not the benefit of a specific party.  I understand Colorado is an extremely diverse state and I would definitely want to respect the best interest of each community and their specific needs.   I am a fair citizen, and tend to fall back on Stephen Coveys book &quot;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People&quot;.

Habit 1: Be Proactive
Habit 2: Begin With the End in Mind
Habit 3: Put First Things First
Habit 4: Think Win-Win
Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood
Habit 6: Synergize
Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw

This would be my exact approach to a position on this commission.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In my current job I am the lead PET-CT technologist, and helped start up the program with a team that also included our Head Nuclear Cardiologist, our finance department, a radio-pharmacy, and computer software company, and our PACS team.  This required critical thinking, team work, analysis of the information we were getting, in depth research, clear communication and constant feedback from our doctors, and of course problem solving.  The outcome was a successful Cardiac PET-CT program, one of the only two in the state, that quickly and accurately diagnoses coronary artery disease for southern Colorado.  

I use these methods to approach and solve any problems that need my attention.
