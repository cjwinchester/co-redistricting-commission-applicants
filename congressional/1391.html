<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Dyslexia - Did a 22-minute TEDx speech advocating for the rights of dyslexic kids (7/6/16, entitled: &quot;Remove your mask of disability&quot;), also worked on the Outreach team while I was on the Board of The Liberty School, which raised money to eventually build a permanent school.  Today, The Liberty School is one of the best schools in the country for dyslexic and gifted kids.  In my past, I also worked as part of a team to organize minority community bone marrow drives throughout northern California (one of my relatives was dying from leukemia, and we realized that the bone marrow registry for hispanics was a fraction of the size of the general market bone marrow registry, which meant that his prognosis wasn&#39;t good). Founded and served as first president of a 10+ member hiking and investing club for women in Silicon Valley that lasted for years until it disbanded in the early 2000&#39;s.  Purpose was to educate women through monthly meetings about researching and buying stocks.  Former president of Durango Earlybird Toastmasters.  From &#39;11 through &#39;14, I advocated for the right to do short term rentals.  I failed, but after months of door-to-door canvasing and adding more owners to my short term rental tent, we did the unthinkable: got a majority of owners to agree to a proposal, which was then killed by the City of Durango.  More recently, I won a traffic appeal, which almost no one ever does.  I felt compelled to fight this racial profiling case in court.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I attend Southwest Republican Women events, but have heretofore not given money or significant time to the cause.  This year, however, I made three videos to be distributed via social media explaining my support for the Constitution 1) a rap, for young people, 2) in Spanish, for Hispanic voters, and 3) 45 minute video in English, explaining why I walked away from the Democrat party.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Republican party, VP Emeritus Board of Directors: The Liberty School, Durango, CO, Toastmasters
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I&#39;m fair, and well-reasoned.  I will study something until I have a great command of it.  I should have been an analyst.  However, I&#39;m also great at motivating people and teaching, either one-on-one or in front of groups.  I am fluent in Spanish, and in fact am a proclaimer in Spanish at my Catholic church.  I&#39;ve delivered many speeches to public organizations like Rotary, in support of the cause of dyslexia outreach.  I greatly dislike gerrymandering, and believe that Republicans need to get involved.  Voting is no longer enough.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I don&#39;t believe in short snippets, which is why I don&#39;t have a social media presence where I spew incendiary comments.  I do believe that if people hear me speak or say something, I better make it worth their while.  Therefore, my outreach is well-reasoned, always.  I believe that politics, and everything really, is complex.  In fact, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  So, I study everything.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Like I said before, I should have been an analyst.  I know a lot about finance, real estate investing, the Constitution, dyslexia advocacy, parenting, and presenting my ideas through public speaking.
