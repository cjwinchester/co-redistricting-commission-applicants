        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Deborah L Bianco</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Deborah L Bianco
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>My maiden name was Deborah L Prouhet.</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I have been retired for more than ten years.  Prior to that time, I practiced law both in private practice and in the office of the Colorado Attorney General.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I received my undergraduate degree at the University of Colorado.  I completed law school at the University of Colorado, and I am admitted to practice law in Colorado.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80207
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been a registered Democrat since I turned 21 years old, and, to my best recollection, I have never missed voting in an election.  I have volunteered as a poll watcher in various elections, and I was also trained and served as an election judge.  I have canvassed for a number of Democratic candidates over the years, and this year I volunteered at my precinct caucus to be a delegate for John Hickenlooper for the Senate.  Because I was not elected to a higher party position, the Office of Legislative and Legal Services has told me that I am not disqualified to apply for a position on the Redistricting Commission.
Since November, 2015, I have individually contributed to the Colorado Democratic Party and to Hickenlooper for Senate through ActBlue.  In addition, my husband and I have contributed to Hillary for America, Joe Neguse for Congress, Hickenlooper for Colorado, Biden for President, Jason Crow for Congress, and Kaitlin Turner for District Attorney.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have been a member of the Denver Art Museum, the Denver Zoo, the Denver Botanic Gardens, and the Denver Museum of Nature and Science for many years.  I have participated in the organization of fundraising events for the Greater Park Hill Neighborhood.  Since I retired, I am no longer a member of the bar association, but I continued to volunteer for the Colorado Board of Law Examiners.  I was a member of the Character and Fitness Committee for eighteen years and participated in the interviews and decisions regarding the applications of many, many applicants to the Colorado bar.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My experience as an attorney in private practice of necessity required vigorous advocacy for my clients.  However, there was also a duty to the larger community and to the court system to insure ethical and honest behavior by all parties and attorneys.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe strongly in the Independent Redistricting Commission.  It has distressed me to see the results of partisan gerrymandering every ten years.  I do not believe it serves democracy or the citizens to have political power apportioned primarily on the basis of the interests of the party which won the state legislature in a census year.  I think Colorado can be an example to the rest of the country, if we are able to institute a more rational and fair system.  The system will only succeed, however, if Colorado citizens are willing to put in the hard work to establish a redistricting map that not only is fair, but, almost as important, is perceived to be fair by the people of Colorado.  I would like to help with this process.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I was a member of a five to ten person panel of the Character and Fitness Committee of the Board of Law Examiners for more than eighteen years.  During that time we interviewed and determined the character and fitness of countless bar applicants.  The panel consisted of lawyers and non-lawyers, conservatives and liberals, men and women.  All of us were dedicated to using our best judgement to decide whether an applicant should be admitted to the practice of law in Colorado.  As you can imagine, we were not always in perfect agreement.  Nonetheless, before reaching a decision every panel member had the opportunity and duty to explain his or her reasoning and to participate in a full discussion of their views.  The process of listening to and respecting the opinions of other members made consensus possible in almost all cases.  In the few cases where agreement was not possible, the fairness of the process prevented resentment on the part of the members who were unable to persuade the majority to their viewpoint.  I like to think that I was both a learner and a teacher of this process and that I contributed to the smooth working of the committee.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
For several years I worked as an appellate attorney for the Colorado Attorney General.  My job was to analyze and write legal briefs on behalf of the State.  This required understanding, dissecting, and countering the arguments of the opponent as well as advancing the best possible arguments for the State.  Logic and reasoning, as well as hard work, were at the heart of the process.
