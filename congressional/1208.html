<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Brenda Sue Kononen
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Brenda S Kononen</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a retired software engineer. My career has been focused on systems and business analysis with emphasis on business database design and analytical processing. Other significant aspects of my work have included software training and quality assurance.
Since my retirement in November, 2018, I&#39;ve done the following work:
- Consulting at a retail shop completing a data conversion project to a new point-of-sale system. (07/2019-05/2020)
- Certified volleyball referee as of 08/2019. Referee middle and high school matches as well as recreational matches for several Northern Colorado area recreation districts. 
- Part-time staff for the Loveland Visitor Center.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I received a M.S. from Colorado State University in 1999 from the College of Business with a degree in Computer Information Science. This degree included coursework in technical writing from the School of Journalism to further my desire to communicating complex, technical subjects to a broader audience. Though working part-time and raising a young family, I graduated in the top 1% of my class garnering membership in Beta Gamma Sigma, the international business honor society for AACSB-accredited schools which are at the top 5% of business school programs worldwide.

I received my B.S. from the College of Business in 1982 from the University of Northern Colorado with a degree in Management Information Science.

<h5>Zip Code</h5>

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not been active in either political campaigns or organizations. I believe I donated $10 to Elizabeth Warren in 2019.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
- Board Member of the Townhomes at Seven Lakes. Elected to one year term 2019. Elected to subsequent term 2020.
- Volunteered with All Hands and Hearts in North Carolina doing Hurricane Florence rebuild work.

- Volunteer with the Loveland Habitat for Humanity.
- Volunteer at the Loveland Visitor Center. (I became a staff member in Dec., 2019.)

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
While I am no longer active, I spent more than a decade (2002-2013) with the Thompson Valley Composite Squadron of the Colorado Wing of Civil Air Patrol (CAP), the civilian auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force. CAPs missions encompass search and rescue (SAR), disaster relief, and aerospace education. This organization provided so many opportunities to advocate and participate in community service, aviation related and otherwise. My accomplishments included:
- FEMA Incident Command training in disaster relief preparation and management
- Air Operations Branch Officer - a position at Incident Command which managed all air assets and crew
- Volleyball coach for the National Cadet Competition team
- Administration Officer for National Cadet Glider Encampment
- Project Officer for the Fort Collins-Loveland Airshow 2002 hosting the Blue Angels with attendance of 65,000 people
- Disaster relief responder for the Hayman Fire, Windsor Tornado
- Orientation ride pilot for cadet&#39;s introduction to flight
- Advocating for and recruited to CAP especially young women who may never have had an opportunity to interact with a female pilot. Giving young women leadership opportunities as well as working with all cadets to create a cohesive team was one of the most rewarding aspects of working with this fine organization.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Our representative democracy is founded on the principle of elected officials representing a group of people. When districts are created, they should, to the extent possible, represent all people who live in that area not just those of a particular affiliation. This work is incredibly important to moving forward with civility, bipartisanship, and compromise which should be more representative all persons living in a geographic area. Efforts toward making that a reality could impact our state for many years. If I can serve the commission by applying my analytical expertise, open-mindedness, and a deep sense of fairness, it would be a great honor as well as a remarkable responsibility.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My work as an Application Architect involved the evaluation of hundreds of installed software applications identifying redundant functionality, performing cost/benefit analysis, recommending a single platform for consolidation, then working with the corporate constituents to gain consensus for the recommendation. The work requires a high attention to detail, excellent research skills, ability to communicate pros and cons succinctly, and conduct focused workshops. Staying open to new information, fact-based concerns, as well as the human factors that go into decision making allowed me to be successful moving projects forward. These skills are all relevant to working on the commission and building consensus for the redistricting efforts. Using data to drive the work while being sensitive to possible biases enhances transparency which, I believe, leads to fair, impartial decisions.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My 36 year career as a software engineer was successful because of my ability to apply logic and reason to problem solving. My unique contribution was to be able to approach a problem from multiple perspectives yielding more than one approach to a find a credible solution. In my realm, a solution is one that not only meets the functional criteria but also optimizes other factors such as ease-of-use, cost, flexibility, and extensibility. Each factor requires research to understand the problem space, doing data collection and analysis, and finally, recommending the best solution. To apply these skills to the redistricting work would be both fascinating and rewarding.
