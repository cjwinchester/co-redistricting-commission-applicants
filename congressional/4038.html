<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a legislative aide, I am the main contact for constituents who need their representative&#39;s office to advocate for them. Most recently, because of the ongoing effects of COVID-19 on the workforce, our office has helped constituents of HD6 resolve unemployment issues that have resulted in them receiving unemployment and/or accessing back unemployment funds. I&#39;ve received more than one email or phone call thanking me for my help. The relief in their voices has been all the thanks I need.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Serving on the commission is a natural extension of everything I stand for as a Coloradan. My father was the Director of the Pikes Peak Community Action Agency (El Paso County) when I was a child. Service to community, and the marginalized has always been part of who I am. My mother worked in the Election Department. I was a &quot;runner&quot; for ballots on election night as a teen. I registered folks to vote once I turned 18. I believe the right to vote and the assumption of the voters that the process isn&#39;t tilted or skewed is key to an informed and engaged electorate. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Over the years that I didn&#39;t live in Colorado, I would be asked where I was from. My answer would always surprise people. I&#39;m an African-American woman who grew up in Colorado Springs, CO. I never understood why folks would be surprised by that. I now know that I didn&#39;t fit their image of who is from Colorado...and I still think that&#39;s odd. I believe that for the most part everyone has the same overarching desires for themselves and their families. I approach everything with this in mind. Promoting consensus and creating agreement starts with recognizing that each commissioner is a Coloradan who loves their state and wants the best for its citizens. It&#39;s important to ask questions to understand where people are coming from and why they are coming from that perspective. We need to be able to see through someone else&#39;s lens. Once we know that, we can get to consensus by asking questions about desired outcomes within established guidelines and taking a step towards that. Someone told me years ago that if you put all of my friends in the same room, the only thing they&#39;d have in common is me. I&#39;ve found that to be true because as I stated above, I start with knowing that we all want the same basic things for ourselves and our families. So there&#39;s always a way to be at any intersection of a debate, seek understanding, then make a decision.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Here is where my 11 years of military service comes into service. One is required to work with, support, and protect shipmates from all walks of life. The ability to analyze a problem and see different avenues of resolution that honors the humanity of each member is key. In terms of applying logic and reason to a problem, over the years I&#39;ve been able to cultivate the ability to compartmentalize how I feel about something and what&#39;s best for me personally. Our thoughts and emotions can get in the way of progress because at that moment we&#39;re unable to see other avenues of resolution that may be viable.
