<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
As the President of Vail Women Elect, I am experienced in organizing women to become more educated and engaged in the election process as voters, volunteers and donors.  As Chair of the Board of Vail Mountain School, I built a board made up of trustees that represented different age groups at the school as well as a variety of professional experiences and social and economic profiles.  I guided them in building a strategy and defining priorities for the school.  I led discussions among the trustees, encouraging the expression of different points of view and guiding the group to reach consensus over critical policy decisions.  As a Board member, parents would contact me to share their opinions, which I needed to consider and address with the Head of School and other Board members.  Decisions made by the VMS Board needed to consider the views of the students, teachers, parents, school administrators and sometimes town officials, town police and school neighbors.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am interested in serving the people in my community and state. I see the commission as a way to use my experience serving on boards and building high functioning teams with diverse people.  In college, I studied Political Geography. I continue to have an interest in understanding how political lines are drawn between countries, states, counties, and congressional districts.  The congressional commission is more fitting for my background and expertise than other areas of government.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have 4 years of experience building consensus as Board Chair for Vail Mountain School.  I tend to listen and ask questions to understand the perspectives, interests and agendas of the other people I am working with.  I first seek areas of common ground.  Then I work on the areas where we differ and find ways for each of us to compromise so that we produce a win-win solution.  I don&#39;t get caught up in proving I am right or winning an argument.  I am intrigued and curious about views outside my own and try to understand those perspectives.  I am also open to shifting my opinion when someone shares data and logic that challenges my views.  I view every challenge or problem as an opportunity to learn.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I love numbers, math problems, statistics, data, and spreadsheets.  My educational background was using census data and geographical mapping to analyze political, economic and social trends.  I continued to use my analytical skills in my professional life, often writing computer programs to analyze large databases to help business leaders make decisions.  Eventually I managed teams that did this work in marketing, merchandising, operations, and logistics for a large retailer.  Recently I worked on a mapping project for Dartmouth to split the Dartmouth Alumni in Colorado into two geographic areas to promote greater Alumni participation.
