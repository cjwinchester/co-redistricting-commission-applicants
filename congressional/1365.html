<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
In the last fifteen years, I have been fortunate to hold leadership positions at the University of Denver (DU) as well as in community organizations, like the Denver Roller Dolls (now Denver Roller Derby). To effectively organize, represent, and advocate for the interests of groups, organizations, and associations, it is imperative to have a clear mission, stay on message, and understand the context within which you are working. For example, as the Director of the Center for World Languages &amp; Cultures (CWLC) at DU, my mission was to support and encourage language teaching, learning, and practice under the broader university mission to serve the public good. I was committed to the university values of inclusion, diversity, and equity. In 2017, the Provost and Budget Officer decided to implement a student testing fee for a required Spanish placement test (while no fee was charged to students testing in other languages) that would have disproportionately affected underrepresented and underserved students, especially first-generation college students and heritage Spanish language speakers from Colorado. In the context of the mission of the university, the mission of the CWLC, and our shared values, I advocated for those students with the upper administration, including Vice Provosts, Budget Officer, and Chief Diversity Officer. After gaining a champion in the Chief Diversity Officer, the Dean’s Council agreed to reverse the decision and find an equitable way to manage placement testing budgets and fees. I do not believe my advocacy would have been effective without a clear, consistent message within the context of the university’s mission and values.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Serving as a commissioner in the redistricting process would be an honor and a welcome responsibility. One of the most exciting things about Colorado is the high level of voter engagement, and I expect a dynamic and engaged redistricting process. To maintain voter engagement, it is essential that Coloradans feel fairly represented in the legislative process. It is more important than ever that our representative districts represent community priorities and not political party agendas. Colorado is not a monolith; it is made up of diverse interests, regions, perspectives, and priorities. The redistricting process should draw districts within which voters identify common interests and within which diverse voices are heard throughout the democratic process. In my professional and community life, I value working within diverse groups of people, confident that we have shared goals even as we have different ideas about how to reach them. I love the challenge of connecting and aligning people to reach shared goals. My graduate work in intercultural communication, mass media, and politics built a strong base from which I was able to create programs and networks at DU that provided unique educational opportunities, as well as a platform from which I could advocate for the underserved and underprivileged. The skills that went into gathering expert advisors, understanding the needs of diverse stakeholders, and creating relevant and accessible solutions are the skills I bring to the redistricting process. In serving as a commissioner, I would represent all Coloradans. As a lifetime unaffiliated voter, I do not have a personal interest in drawing lines to favor any political party. I cannot imagine a better way in which I can serve the community and state that I love than as a part of this first independent redistricting commission.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
It is essential that the Independent Redistricting Commission model representative and collaborative decision-making. I have always sought ways to facilitate human connection and a sense of belonging in others, whether in professional, community, or social settings. Working across groups with diverse interests has made me adept at identifying commonalities, bringing people together, and keeping them engaged to get things done. Working across departments at a university, as well as teaching adult learners, has made me a strong facilitator. I bring discussions back to the main question at hand when they digress. I am not afraid to respectfully pose challenging questions when necessary. And as a big picture thinker and empathetic communicator, I quickly summarize discussions and pull out key points. I would help commissioners stay on point and recognize when consensus is found. Each commissioner needs to be engaged in the process and buy in to the final redistricting recommendation to the Colorado Supreme Court. While every concern of every commissioner may not be addressed in the final recommendation, it is important that every commissioner be satisfied that the concerns were addressed during the redistricting process. For example, when faced with a highly-charged conflict between members of the Denver Roller Dolls, a diverse 100-member nonprofit to promote the development of women through sport and community, it was through adherence to the bylaws, commitment to a process of fairness and impartiality to all who wished to voice an opinion, and constantly referring back to our mission that I was able to guide the league through the conflict and find consensus on a resolution. I am an enthusiastic communicator of shared vision and values, and I engage others in that enthusiasm to work through disagreements. With a diverse Colorado population, there is no perfect solution for all individuals, but the Commission can always agree to best serve the whole. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
By nature, I am a big picture thinker and problem solver. The Colorado redistricting process requires a commitment to the overarching goal of drawing impartial, representative districts to ensure voter engagement and fair representation in the democratic process at local and national levels. I am quick to identify problems and make sense of the context in which they exist. I always think about how to improve systems, which may be organizational, programmatic, or cultural. Through my engineering and instructional design experience, I have developed the ability to identify and analyze problems and develop solutions that integrate into broader contexts. At the University of Denver, I was the leader or key player in strategic planning and program restructuring for two divisions (University College and Internationalization), efforts which required collaboration with diverse stakeholders and clear communication of purpose and progress. I can synthesize information from a variety of sources and find connections and intersections that others may miss. I am able to work in quantitative and/or qualitative methods of data gathering and analysis. My intercultural communication training has developed my ability to identify and question biases in the processes of data gathering and data analysis. In addition to data gathering and analysis, I have successfully led highly detailed event planning projects, the largest of which was as co-chair of the task force for DU’s participation in and a contributing member of the StudyColorado’s planning committee for the NAFSA: Association of International Educators annual conference, held in Denver in 2016.
