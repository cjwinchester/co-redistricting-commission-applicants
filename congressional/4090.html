<h3>Background</h3>

I have donated funds to Democratic political campaigns and party organizations.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>

1. Law and Policy Specialist, Colorado Sierra Club. 2. Naturalist and Environmental Historian, Barr Lake State Park, Brighton, Colorado.

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As a Vietnam Veteran (Marine Corps, 1967), on my return in my senior year in college I served as a Congressional Intern in the offices of my representative, the Hon. Morris K. Udall of Arizona, in which capacity I advised him on. the realities of the war.  During my time in his office, I gained tremendous respect for Rep. Udall as a political healer.  He was a master of working with congressional colleagues from across the political spectrum to find common ground and work towards common objectives.  I feel that at this point in time, our state and our nation are in desperate need of that same kind of healing--of once again learning how to communicate with civility and mutual respect across political and policy divides.  In Colorado, I think this can be done by designing congressional districts that are not densely populated by only one segment of the political spectrum, but that to the extent reasonably possible reflects the diversity of Colorado&#39;s political variability.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a member of the Buddhist clergy, I have taught mindfulness meditation and mindful communication in a secular context to various environmental organizations and to workshops sponsored by the US Veterans Affairs Departments.  And the Buddhist congregation I lead in Denver is also politically as well as ethnically diverse.  It is therefore incumbent on me to teach the peace-making skills of mindfulness meditation and communication in a way that is accessible to and useful to all persons.  So my own political views play no role in this leadership and training capacity.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I&#39;ve just finished a 30-year career teaching law and public policy to MA and PhD students in the University of Colorado&#39;s School of Public Affairs.  My highest ethical obligation during that period was to ensure that all students in my classes or under my tutelage felt safe, respected, and valued, regardless of their political persuasion, ethnic lineage, gender identity/sexual orientation, physical abilities, or age.  I taught them to view and discuss matters of law and public policy from diverse perspectives--including those with which they did not agree.  This is because I was training public servants to serve the entire populous.  I sought to model my own behavior in ways I hoped (when I was doing it well) that they might emulate on the job.  In law school we were taught to &quot;think like a lawyer&quot;: become thoroughly versed on multiple perspectives, and then advocate your client&#39;s vigorously.  My goal as a legal educator rather than practitioner was in some ways more challenging: teaching my students to &quot;think like a public administrator&quot;: to become versed in multiple perspectives, but then to remember that their &quot;clients&quot; are the public as a whole.  My students&#39; constitutional responsibility was to lawfully carry out the policies and procedures of the political branches; but to do so in a way that all members of the public deemed fair and just, whether they agreed with those policies or not.  Both my professional training and my entire professional career have been devoted to appreciation of the logic and merits of multiple perspectives; and this is the background I will bring to bear on discharging the duties of a redistricting commissioner, should I be accorded that honor.
With regard to the question of letters of recommendation (below), several years ago I befriended the Hon. Mark Malarkey, former Chief Justice of the Colorado Supreme Court.  Over time, we had some interesting professional ethics discussions about parallels between her role on the court and mine in the classroom, in circumstances where personal views needed to be held in abeyance in service to the dispassion necessary to do the job well. Justice Malarkey is now quite ill.  I believe I can procure a letter from her if that would be helpful to the processing of my application.  However, I hesitate to ask this of her unless it would be genuinely useful, since a great deal of effort would be needed for her to produce one.  Please let me know if I should make this request of her.
