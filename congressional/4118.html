        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Sarah Kelsey Salmon</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Sarah Kelsey Salmon
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  University of Colorado Boulder: Department of Mathematics, Graduate Teaching Assistant (Aug 2014-Dec 2018, Aug 2019-Present), Student Academic Success Center, Lecturer (Jan 2019-May 2019)

Northern Arizona University: Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid, Client Services Representative (Sept 2011-May 2014), Department of Mathematics, Grader (Sporatic semesters 2012-2014)
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  University of Colorado: 
PhD Mathematics, anticipated May 2021
MA Mathematics, May 2017

Northern Arizona University: BS Mathematics May 2011
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80304
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am involved with the political endorsements of my labor union. Generally, I meet with candidates or elected officials to determine how we can improve labor law in Colorado for the workers. I have personally donated small amounts of money to both Ilana Spiegel&#39;s campaign for regent in CD6 and the Biden Harris campaign. I also volunteered with the Spiegel campaign doing things like literature drops and making phone calls.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
500 Women Scientists, United Campus Workers Colorado (formerly the Committee on Rights and Compensation for graduate workers at CU Boulder), American Mathematical Society, Mathematical Association of America.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Primarily, my experience in this area comes from my work with my labor union, United Campus Workers Colorado (UCW) and its predecessor, the Committee on Rights and Compensation (CRC). At this time, the law in Colorado does not guarantee recognition or collective bargaining for the workers in my union. We have met with local legislators to discuss the best time and avenues to introduce legislation that would strengthen the rights of workers. At a bird&#39;s eye view, our workers are employed by an elected body, the Board of Regents. So we have brought our concerns to them through public comment at their meetings, letter writing campaigns, and personal meetings (which I often organize and facilitate).
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on this commission because I think I have an invaluable combination of skills in this area. First and foremost, my research area is in algebraic combinatorics which means I have a deep understanding of many metrics that mathematicians have developed in recent years to measure districts to determine if partisan gerrymandering is likely present. I also have a strong background in statistical analysis. Further, I understand much of the political landscape of Colorado but know that I still have much to learn. In sum, this is a unique opportunity for my educational and political interest to merge for the furthering of social justice. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am a professional problem solver. If that problem is trying to reach a consensus or agreement, I will approach that problem with patience, creativity, and clear communication to reach a solution. Generally, my approach to reaching agreements is to untangle the problem until we can find common ground, then rebuild a solution upon that foundation. Compromise is key to this process. As a math instructor, I find myself needing to make fair and impartial decisions every day. I can&#39;t play favorites with my students and their grades or opportunities, nor will I act in a biased manner if selected to serve on this committee.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a mathematician, my training in logical reasoning and analysis is a fundamental part of my career and way of thinking. Although research mathematics is more artistic than many believe it to be, I must still prove my results using full and complete logical implications, written in a way my peers unfamiliar with the particular case can understand. Every homework assignment I&#39;ve had since 2011 (and that&#39;s a lot), every paper I&#39;ve written or edited, and every talk I&#39;ve given about mathematics, has been first training and then evidence that I can consistently form complete logical justifications and communicate my reasoning clearly to many different audiences.
