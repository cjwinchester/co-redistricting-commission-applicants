</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
 My resume reflects the numerous organizations that I have helped start and/or for which I have served on the boards.  I have lobbied for issues concerning adoption laws and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.  I chaired the Colorado FASD Commission.  Various organizations that I helped start include the Safe Shelter of St. Vrain Valley (domestic violence), the Inn Between of Longmont (transitional housing), Illuminate Colorado (child welfare), Brigit&#39;s Village (low income housing), and Brigit&#39;s Bounty Community Resources (feeding the poor and educating about growing crops).  I served on a Social Services Advisory Board and co-chaired a Welfare Reform Review Committee in Boulder County and helped start the Juvenile Law section of the Boulder County Bar Association.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have farmed in a rural area (near Timnath) as well as living in towns along the Front Range.  As a Sociologist and activist, I have experienced the dynamics of living in a county seat (Ft. Collins) vs. more rural areas of counties (Longmont, then Frederick).   So I have a sense of what it means to be disenfranchised.  I have watched our political boundaries being gerrymandered over the years with deep frustration.  I would love to be able to be involved with creating voting districts that are non-partisan and make sense with regard to representing the people who live there. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I&#39;ve always prided myself on my commitment to bringing people together to create a better solution than the individuals could have created on their own.  An example is the Inn Between of Longmont.  It was created after we brought together all of the agencies in Longmont who had clients with a need for transitional housing.  I chaired the collaboration that established the model that is still basically used, where each agency refers their clients and commits to provide case management.  Originally there was a complex model of 1st right of refusal to give each agency equal access, although I&#39;m not sure if they still use that part now (over 20 years later).  I also worked with the St. Vrain Community Council (and chaired it at one point) and more recently the Carbon Valley Network.  This kind of collaboration requires that the leaders be fair and impartial if they are going to be successful.  I pride myself in being able to do that.  In my law practice, I represented the best interest of children, which also required me to see the world from the perspective of the child, the parents, and the system in order to determine that best interest.  Often the best interest of the child was for me to pull the parties together to work together to find the best solution.  I am a good listener and able to help various parties to listen to and understand each other.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My Sociology degree was a research-based course of study.  I was also the Primary Investigator on 2 Federal grants in the Adams Count Court between 2005 and 2012.  In that role I was responsible for tracking an extensive research project as well as supervising the case workers obtaining the data.  The longevity of agencies that I have started, such as the Safe Shelter and the Inn Between, are a testimony to my focus on solid, analytical decision-making.,
