<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I have many years of experience working with diverse interests to find common ground.  I worked with the Animas River Stakeholders Group (ARSG) for 25 years to find ways to implement cleanup of abandoned mines in the Silverton area.  ARSG consisted of federal regulatory and land management agencies, state regulatory agencies, local governments, mining companies, environmental groups and interested citizens.  For the last ten years of its existence, I ran monthly ARSG meetings and coordinated all the partners involved.  The group, along with its partners, characterized approximately 140 mine sites and completed 60 mine remediation projects.  I was the co-author of a major study recommending feasible, water-quality standards for the upper Animas River Basin.  I represented the group during hearings where those standards were formally adopted by the State of Colorado.  The group had no formal voting membership and operated by consensus.

After EPA caused the Gold King Mine spill, the upper Animas River Basin was designated a Superfund site in 2016.  I initiated the formation of a Community Advisory Group (CAG) and have served as its chair since its inception.  CAG&#39;s are a formal component of the Superfund process, and ours has been recognized by EPA under CERCLA.  CAG&#39;s must represent a diverse set of local interests.  Our group includes representatives of mining, agriculture, local governments, environmental non-profits, the local health department, municipal water utilities, etc. 

I have also served on both the Colorado Water Quality Control Commission and Colorado Air Quality Control Commission and at times have chaired both commissions.  I have presided over a number of complex, contentious regulatory hearings involving a wide range of interests.  I&#39;m quite familiar with working with state public processes including staff and attorneys. 

In addition, I have also served as a commissioner on the State of Colorado/Southern Ute Indian Tribe Environmental Commission and as the president or chair of a water authority (water utility), road association, and advisory group to our local county commission on water issues.   
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Nine years on the Colorado Water Quality Control Commission (three years as chair).
Six years on the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission (one year as chair).
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
It would be an honor to serve on this commission.  I care deeply about Colorado,  Other than a few years away at school, I have lived in the state all my life.  I was born and raised in Denver, but have lived over half my life in rural areas of the Western Slope and have good understanding of both urban and rural cultures.  At one time or another, I have traveled through all but two counties in the state.

The state legislators and voters have provided a tremendous opportunity for Colorado to be a leader in reducing partisan fighting over congressional redistricting.  It&#39;s a historical opportunity for the state to demonstrate that its citizens can work together to minimize political discord, and with my skill set, I&#39;d like to be a part of that process.    
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have many years of experience developing consensus among diverse interests.  I listen carefully and try to understand different people&#39;s perspectives.  I treat everyone with respect and tamp down any personal attacks that may surface within a group.

Most importantly, I try to keep people on task.  I&#39;m good at sifting through volumes of information and identifying the key questions and issues that need to be discussed and decided in order for a group or commission to move forward.

I believe I can be impartial in making decisions.  I have no political, financial, or personal stake in how the districts are ultimately drawn.  I simply want to see a transparent and fair process where the people of Colorado feel their voices have been heard.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have strong analytical skills as evidenced by my different degrees.  For years, I&#39;ve developed numerous water quality analyses comparing existing quality to standards which have been the basis for instigating cleanup of abandoned mine sites.
