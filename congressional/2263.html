</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My first graduate professional training (1969-1971) was in community social work, which I practiced subsequently in several communities in Colorado, California, Texas, and Washington, DC.  I have taught graduate courses in public policy advocacy at the University of Denver, the University of Colorado School of Public Affairs, UCLA, and the University of San Francisco.  Now that I am retired, I serve (without pay) as executive director of the Colorado Latino Leadership, Advocacy, &amp; Research Organization (CLLARO).  CLLARO has engaged in nonpartisan public policy advocacy in Colorado since 1964.  In the 2020 general election, for example, CLLARO took positions on ballot propositions 116, 117, 118, and amendments B and 76.  CLLARO advocacy for Colorado Latinos often involves membership in standing coalitions.  For example, CLLARO has been a member of the Colorado Civic Engagement Roundtable, the Governor&#39;s Full-Day Kindergarten Coalition, Great Education Colorado, Hate Free Colorado Coalition, the Colorado Nonprofit Association, the Montbello Collective, UnidosUS (in Washington, DC), and Vision 2020.   CLLARO leadership programs train prospective new leaders from low-income Latino and African-American communities.  The CLLARO Parents Advocating for Local Schools (PALS) program trains parents whose children attend under-resourced public schools to become more effective advocates for their children.  Parents learn to work more effectively with their children&#39;s teachers.  Parents also learn to advocate in groups when talking with school principals, school district administrators, school board members, and state legislators.  The CLLARO Capitol Fellowship Program admits college students each year on a competitive basis.  Most applicants are the first in their families to attend college.  CLLARO provides them intensive training in public policy and legislative process and procedure, and then places them in the offices of individual legislators where they work 20 hours per week throughout the regular legislative session.  Fellows completing the program typically intend to become public policy advocates for communities where they grew up, &amp;/or consider running for office themselves later in their careers.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Amendments Y and Z arguably give equal weight to protection of communities of interest AND traditional protection of geographically defined counties and municipalities.  If I am fortunate enough to serve on the commission, I hope to help assure protection of minority interests--including racial and ethnic minorities--in future delineation of district boundaries.  Given my knowledge and experience with mathematical modeling and quantitative analytic methods, I would hope to have collegial and collaborative working relationships not only with fellow commissioners, but also with staff assisting the commission with development and evaluation of alternative maps.  As an experienced community organizer with good working relationships with advocates for historically underrepresented low-income communities in Colorado, I would encourage and welcome participation by all communities of interest at commission hearings.  I would be honored to help the commission give equitable consideration to the interests of all Coloradans.   
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My first step toward consensus and agreement is being an attentive, sympathetic, and patient listener, especially to those with whom I might eventually disagree.  I learned long ago during happier times on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, that strange bedfellows occasionally become excellent ad hoc partners on specific issues, even if we amicably agree to disagree on other occasions.  In my experience, truth, honesty, and reliability are prerequisite to trust, and trust is prerequisite to finding common ground.  I believe in respecting verifiable factual evidence, both congenial and uncongenial.  There may be times when conflicting values lead inevitably to adversarial argument and divided votes.  But I believe Coloradans are better served when commissioners are committed to civility, mutual respect, respect for the law, verifiable evidence, search for mutual and compatible interests, and achieving consensus whenever possible.  Those are my goals for my own conduct, should I be chosen to serve on the commission.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My social work training at a young age still helps me appreciate how common interests can foster interpersonal relationships leading to communities of interest and social change.  My later training in public policy was less intuitive and logically more rigorous.  Public policy analysis is a multidisciplinary profession requiring integration of microeconomic theory, descriptive and inferential statistics, mathematical modeling, data analysis, law, and political and organizational analysis, often in the face of inflexible deadlines, when helping policymakers understand real-life problems and choose between competing solutions.  I have taught graduate courses in this field at the University of California (Berkeley and UCLA), the University of Colorado, and the University of Denver.  Most importantly, I have used those skills myself in Washington, DC, and other political arenas.  In both social work and policy analysis, logic is an aid to better decisions.  But logic is not enough.  Solving difficult problems often requires weighing values (especially when values conflict) and identifying and thinking critically about underlying assumptions.  Solving problems successfully can be both art and science.
