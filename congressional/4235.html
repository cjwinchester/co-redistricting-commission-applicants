        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Isaiah Spencer Martin</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Isaiah Spencer Martin
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Isaiah Spencer Martin</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Currently, I am an Inventory manager at a company called Safilo. With this position, I manage the warehouse&#39;s inventory and make sure all products are stocked and ready for delivery. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I obtained a bachelor&#39;s degree in Political Science with a minor in Ethnic Studies, in the spring of 2018. Before graduating I also had the opportunity to work with the city manages the office of Englewood, Colorado in the summer of 2017.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80205
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
During my time at CSU not only was I able to participate in the student government, but I was also able to participate in multiple voter drives in Fort Collins. I was also able to help with student campaigns during the Associated Students of Colorado State University presidential elections.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Since fall 2015 I had been the first senator to represent the Black and African American Cultural Center within the body of the Associated Students of Colorado State University, which is the Student Government at Colorado State University. Since the Fall of 2016, I have also been a brother of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. which helps to further the advancement of the Black community, as well as, promoting the need to vote amongst many other important aspects of life.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
During my time at Colorado State University, I was able to participate in multiple events on campus in which I would help students to organize and use their voice for the needs that they wanted on campus. During this time I helped organize different protests around the campus, organized and led lobbying to create new positions in the student government on campus, and helped to be a role model for fellow student activists on campus. After college, I was able to organize with a few friends and work with an organization called soul stories, in order to address the growing problems of gentrification in the Denver area.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on this commission in order to help create fair redistricting lines for our state, especially after the conundrum of the Donald Trump Presidency, as well as, bring a voice and perspective that will represent Denver natives in a growing city full of new incoming citizens.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that I can provide a consensus to the commissioners due to my experience in the student government with working not only with multiple people but creating and contributing fair debate and dialogue with the focus on the major goals and problems that would affect all of us. If elected into this position I will also be able to be impartial as I will have a focus on the real problems within Colorado districts and leave party affiliatiion to the sidelines when it comes down to business.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Due to my experience and work with different student organizations and interest groups, I am able to address and solve problems with a level head whether they were expected or not. I am also able to gather large amounts of information during different situations to address any issues and find the best outcome to solve the issues.
