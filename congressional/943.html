        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Stacey Kristen Proctor</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Stacey Kristen Proctor
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Stacey Proctor</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Project Manager with the Boulder County Community Planning and Permitting Department
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a Bachelor&#39;s Degree from the University of Colorado, Boulder, with a minor in Ethnic Studies and Master&#39;s Degree in Public Administration from the University of Colorado, Denver. I am also certified as a Project Management Professional from the Project Management Institute. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80027
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have volunteered for candidates for political office, from local State Senate candidates to Presidential candidates. In 2018, I volunteered in support of Proposition 112, which would have increased the required distance between oil and gas wells and homes. In 2008 I was a precinct captain for the Democratic Party in my precinct. 

In addition, I have been active in non-partisan civic engagement campaigns, including voter registration, voter education, and voter turn-out. 

Since 2015, political donations (to the best of my recollection) have included Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, Fair Fight Georgia, New Era Colorado, several other Act Blue campaigns. 

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Since Nov. 15, 2015, I have been involved in my community in several ways. First, I have been active with Together Against Neighborhood Drilling (TAND), a local organization working to prevent oil and gas drilling near homes and schools. With this organization, I recruited volunteers, educated the community, testified at the State Legislature, and worked to pass Proposition 112. 

As a member of the LGBTQ community, I created a support group for other local LGBTQ parents. I have also volunteered as a coach for my son’s soccer team, organized parenting classes for parents at my children’s preschool, and organized neighborhood get-togethers at our local park.  

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
In 2002, I worked on a campaign called Vote for Children. The goal of this campaign was to encourage people who don’t normally vote in mid-term elections to vote. This experience ignited a passion for civic engagement and democracy and since then I have been an advocate for increasing access to voting for all. I have worked for numerous non-profit organizations advocating for labor rights, LGBTQ rights, voting rights, and more. 

For five years, I worked at the Colorado Energy Office supporting the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). WAP is a national program to make low-income homes more energy efficient, while also reducing energy costs for the resident. I was dedicated to making sure that residents in all 64 counties in Colorado had access to this important program. I worked closely with the local service providers to understand the unique challenges throughout the state. The mountain areas had higher costs, due to colder winters and more people having propane as their heating source. Some service providers served multiple counties--some urban and some rural, with the rural areas feeling like they weren’t getting their fair share of services. I traveled throughout the state, meeting with services providers, residents, and other local officials to ensure the program was successful for all Coloradans. 

In my current role at Boulder County, I actively engage members of the public and other stakeholders in decision-making processes and have made efforts to ensure that underserved populations are meaningfully included in our public engagement efforts. 

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As a 4th generation Coloradan, raising my children in Colorado, and someone who is passionate about civic engagement, I am interested in serving on the Redistricting Commission because I believe fair Congressional District maps are critical to a healthy democracy and encouraging voters to participate in the democratic process.

Serving on this commission would be an incredible opportunity to serve my community and my state in a way that will have a lasting impact far into the future. I would be honored to be able to use my unique experience, skills, and background to help make the new redistricting process in Colorado a success.  

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a Project Manager/Planner with Boulder County, my job requires me to consider multiple perspectives and work with diverse stakeholders to come to consensus. For example, as the project manager for Boulder County’s recently adopted Transportation Master Plan, I engaged with many different stakeholders including staff, the public, and staff from other municipalities within Boulder County. We also worked with advocacy organizations for people with disabilities, older adults, the local Chamber of Commerce, and cycling groups. My role was to find a way to incorporate the input from a diverse group of stakeholders, while ensuring the plan still met the overall vision outlined by the Board of County Commissioners and the county’s Comprehensive Plan. 

I would use these same skills to promote consensus among commissioners on the redistricting commission. It will be important to listen to each other as well as the members of the public, while also ensuring compliance with the requirements outlined to the commissioners.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have experience managing very complex projects. For example, I was the project manager for the design and construction of stream restoration projects adjacent to road reconstruction projects in Boulder County after the 2013 flood. There were many constraints that impacted how the projects could be built, including resident preferences, regulatory requirements, funding limitations, and physical constraints. In order to successfully complete these projects, the team had to work collaboratively and come up with creative solutions for challenging problems. 

As a Project Manager I have the ability to understand the minute details of a project, while at the same time, never losing sight of the bigger picture. This skill will allow me to provide meaningful contributions to the Congressional Redistricting Commission and help to achieve the criteria outlined for the redistricting process.
