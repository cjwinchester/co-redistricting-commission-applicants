        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Kerry Galusha</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Kerry Galusha
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am an attorney.  Since June 2020, I’ve been staying home to provide childcare to my son.  
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a Juris Doctor, magna cum laude, from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco, CA (2010) and a Bachelor of Arts, magna cum laude, from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA (2005).  I am licensed to practice law in Colorado, California, and Utah.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81623-1717
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I’ve donated to a variety of Democratic campaigns over the last five years; including, Paula Stepp, the Garfield County Democratic Party, Beatriz Soto, and Diane Mitsch Bush.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I’ve been a tutor for Literacy Outreach, an organization in Garfield County that teaches basic literacy skills to adults, since moving back to Colorado in 2016.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Working as an attorney in multi-party litigation, as well as, in the public pension context, I’ve gained experience in moving parties to consensus, compromise, and settlement when there is a fixed amount of monetary settlement to be divided and it is necessary to expand the pie by including non-monetary settlement terms. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that independent redistricting commissions are one antidote to the deep political polarization that our country is facing.  In order for citizens to have faith in the government and to have representatives that are invested and attentive to their constituents’ interests, it is essential that voting districts are drawn fairly.  I also believe it is of paramount importance that the public perceives that the creation of the voting districts is independent and free of the partisan gerrymandering that plagues other states. Therefore, I believe my work on the commission will help contribute to the Colorado public’s confidence that their representatives will be held accountable and responsive to their needs, and thus, contribute to Colorado citizens’ participation in the electoral process.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my professional experience, I’ve participated in numerous mediation and settlement conferences involving multiple parties. In such conferences, my role has been not only to advocate for my client’s position, but also candidly assess the strength of the opponent’s position and perspective, and communicate that understanding to my own client–often using a variety of advocacy tools that helped my client understand all the parties’ positions. Such candid discussions often led to solutions that were beneficial to all parties.  Further, to reach such compromises and face the factual reality of any given dispute, I have practiced removing emotions and passions surrounding the issues from my analysis. I believe I will be able to use these skills and experiences to help build consensus among the commissioners. I also learned to be fair and impartial while clerking for Judge McHugh of the Utah Court of Appeals. In that role, I researched and drafted opinions for both criminal and civil appeals and learned to apply the law without favoring one side or the other. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Working in the complicated world of public employee pension funds and construction defect litigation, I developed critical analytical and research skills that will translate well into work on the redistricting commission.  In the past, I’ve exceled in synthesizing complex statutory schemes, administrative policies, and divergent Colorado case law into digestible advice for my clients. I also honed my ability to negotiate and seek resolutions between diverse factions and stakeholders, such as the public employee retirement board, its members, and city and county governments through clear and concise communication.
