<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
My primary involvement in advocating for youth in our state is through my profession. As a teacher, I have had the opportunity to make a direct impact in the lives of my students while learning to meet the unique needs of different families and demographics. In my 10+ years of teaching, I have been a huge advocate for my students by encouraging them to pursue trades or higher education and by writing letters of recommendation for scholarships. I was volunteer youth basketball coach for 5+ plus years before the pandemic. Through coaching, I was able to connect with kids in my community and encourage them to make healthy choices and stay active. Additionally, my family makes yearly contributions to the Ronald McDonald House, Children&#39;s Hospital, or Lutheran Family Services.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have become increasingly interested in the political climate in Colorado for quite a few years. I have personal stake in legislation that puts the needs Colorado families and small business as a top priority. I believe that I have a unique perspective because I understand the fine balance between a system that offers a safety net for those in need while being responsible and fair with taxpayer dollars. I strongly believe that creating a system that allows marginalized communities to have a say in the laws that govern them and legislators who represent them strengths civic involvement and the fabric of our democracy. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
 I have experience working in groups for a common cause. From working on fundraising campaigns for my children&#39;s school or working with administrators and other educators on developing value and mission statements for the program that I work for, I have had success working to build consensus and meet goals. I enjoy the process of debating and discussing topics, listening to multiple points of view, and working towards positive outcomes. I am very invested in groups or commissions that I have joined and regularly go the extra mile to help the whole group succeed. I am passionate about making a difference in my community and State and ensure that every Colorado resident has the opportunity to pursue a life where they and their families thrive. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am practiced in understanding that in order to solve complex problems it is necessary to utilize critical thinking skills that considers the view of all stake holders. I feel that in many ways, I have developed the ability to consider that oftentimes, conflict is born out of the inability to differentiate between subjective and objective realities. I think that every person that is involved in public service should have the ability to remove the emotion from charged topics and consider the wellbeing and needs of others. The current climate has become so charged and intolerant, being able to consider different perspectives is in short supply. I value the freedom to choose the morals and values that guide my life and believe that it is important that I honor others freedom to do the same. One of my primary strengths is the ability to approach complex issues with creative problem solving and critical thinking while considering the needs of all the stakeholders.
