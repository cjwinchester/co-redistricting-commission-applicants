<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
As a CDPHE employee of 7 years assignments in the Water Quality &amp; HazMat Divisions, both environmental offices,  always had priorities and responsibilities to serve the public sector, always representing, advocating and considering their interests.   Every effort was made to notify the public of any or all environmental or health issues that may affect their well-being or health, thru public hearings, freedom of information requests and media presentations.   During my tenure in HazMat the Department worked closely with the Attorney General&#39;s office to inform the city of Henderson and neighboring counties of the ground-water pollution contamination caused by the U.S. DOE Rocky Mountain Arsenal and Rocky Flats plant.  And studying at Georgia Tech a 100-year flood resulted in major damage to the county and neighborhood where I resided; I dedicated my Final Option paper to resolving and initiating new strategies that would not only restore the storm water ways, but add aesthetic and healthy alternatives to the community.  During the gathering o the information and data, I was also able to relate how some of the issues, new policies being initiated would affect the community, based on interviews and comments gathered.   As a private citizen, I&#39;ve spent many hours volunteering in after school programs, PTA&#39;s, K-8 sports programs (always a team mom), and in Georgia became a member of the Women of the Hall, advocating for children and women issues; or on campus tutoring our foreign students.  Attending GT as a US minority student had me representing the needs of the Hispanic students, whose international enrollment was quickly growing during this 21st century but leaving behind our American counterparts and little retention or recruitment initiatives were put in place to assist them.  I worked for five years to alleviate this problem and bring a collaboration and consensus among the student and alumni groups.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
During my 30&#39;s the Director of our Department sent around a Venn diagram; asking you to plot your goals and aspirations, as a State employee.  Until then, I had no goals, I was just surviving and raising children, as a single-mother.  But since then, a pursuit was ventured upon to gain a higher education; it was so intoxicating the pursuit extended to 21+years.  Upon receipt of my degrees, those stones I&#39;d laid for a career in politics, fell apart, with a blink of an eye and a mother&#39;s worst horror.  Since then, I&#39;ve struggled to gain control and re-gather the stones thrown aside in the turmoil.  Today, they are set and awaiting a firm short path, in which I can best serve my community with the talents and education I&#39;ve gained throughout these years.   Cause the student loans are barking at my heels, reminding me of just how much &#39;knowledge&#39; I have to share.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a State of Colorado employee, I&#39;ve always had to promote a consensus of the administration&#39;s pursuit to create a good, safe and clean learning environment. Whether it was for the Health Department or at Auraria campus, as a public sector employee it is our responsibility to represent our government, as best we can.  We are the citizen source/protectors/advocates that persuade the members of the community.  And if disarray is visualized or experienced, as advocates a plan is generated and supplied to counter or meet the disorganization/disagreement. Consensus is achieved by finding the middle ground, ideas that meet both or all parties needs; then working toward a mutual agreement on those outliers, merging them or redefining them, possibly allowing a better consensus. Being impartial can be difficult when it comes to meeting the demands and needs of children and the elderly, they are so vulnerable and require our steadfast and consistent support but their needs should not revoke or overshadow the needs and rights of our younger more vibrant portion of the community - our workforce.   As a Urban Engineer planner upon graduation and with every new certification a pledge is made to serve the public and not the government that pays your salary.  Our duty is be fair and impartial when making decisions that affect an entire community; it is our responsibility to represent the community to the government agencies, with ideas, grievances, modifications, new or renewed development they should seek.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
The Masters in Public Policy aligns me with a strong analytical background in engineering, natural science, and social science which grounded the underlying conceptual and methodological issues in policy research, including causality and explanation.  The  appropriate uses of theories and models, collection and evaluation of data, and common threats to validity and reliability.   The Masters in City and Regional Planning also allowed development for policy analysis and the zoning and planning of cities, transportation at the national, state, and local levels
