<div class='applicant-detail'>

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Let&#39;s be frank.  Redistributing has often been about partisan wrangling where each party seeks to advance its own political influence and dominance over the other.  This however should not be about parties but about people, and those of us who have to live with the decision that others make.  My whole life I have been a peace maker often looking for pathways between two warring ideals.  The beginning of consensus and agreement starts with listening.  We need to listen and hear each other first and focus on our shared values as Coloradoans.  Often we speak our opinions too readily instead of hearing the opinions of others.  I would listen to what others feel and fear and hope for I this process so that everyone has a voice that is heard.  In scenarios when we disagree we need to negotiate and mutually construct a shared pathway to help us navigate our differences while at the same time protecting the validation of our positions.  When people are heard and considered and their voices and opinions are heard and acted upon it will foster consensus and ownership of a pathway we can all live with
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Coming from a science background I have been trained in an analytical discipline.  Mist of my life I have been specifically trained to deeply and actively assess data and to see it with a critical eye.  In science we have a very heavy emphasis on looking at data critically because we are trying to understand the the truth of how the world works.  In this process logic both deductive and inductive is a deeply ingrained part of our process.  All arguments or claims must be based on sound premises that themselves are supported by data.  In addition to this the claim made needs to have data that answers or specifically supports that claim.  Often our data answers a question that is different than what we are asking.  In this case we must always follow the data to determine what it is revealing.  We need to do this always in an intellectually honest way, by acknowledging our biases and then controlling for them so that they do not taint our conclusions.  Everything we do must have an intellectually honest and rigorous framework so that we can discern the rational from the irrational, and control for our biases, and so that we can creat a fair and equitable solution that benefits all voters in Colorado.
