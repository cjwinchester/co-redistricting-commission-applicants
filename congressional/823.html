        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for savinay nathan chandrasekhar</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  savinay nathan chandrasekhar
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  CEO of Minds Matter Colorado
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  University of Pennsylvania - BS Systems Engineering &#39;03
Thunderbird School of Global Management - MBA Global Management &#39;10
The Broad Center - Masters in Educational Leadership, &#39;13
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80221
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
My entire job is advocating for under-represented voices in our community -- I&#39;m the CEO of Minds Matter Colorado, which connects driven and determined high school students from low-income families with the people, preparation, and possibilities they need to succeed in college, create their futures, and change the world. My goal is to help eradicate systemic inequity in higher education for our students, and to expand our programming to provide access to Minds Matter to every student, corner-to-corner across Colorado.

In addition I&#39;ve been asked to speak at multiple conferences and summits on issues related to creativity, innovation, collaboration, diversity, equity, inclusion, and anti-racism, including the Harvard Innovation Summit, B:Civic Summit, Colorado Mentoring Summit, and the National Association of Independent Schools People of Color Conference. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I&#39;ve donated to campaigns for people that I know (Aaron Goldhamer, Lisa Cutter, Mike Johnston, Chantell Taylor) for various local and federal offices, and I&#39;ve donated to Elizabeth Warren&#39;s Presidential Campaign. However I&#39;ve supported and voted for many Republican and Independent candidates over the years as well. I consider myself firmly centrist, independent, and nonpartisan. My goals are to support what is in the best interests of our country and state, not what&#39;s in the best interest of any individual or political entity.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I&#39;ve been on the boards of the Luminary Learning Network (a collection of innovative schools within the Denver Public School district), the Civic Canopy (an organization geared towards building cultures of collaboration across the state), and the Denver Metro Chamber Leadership Foundation (an organization that serves to educate and inspire civic leaders in the Denver Metro community), as well as the Minds Matter Colorado and Minds Matter National organizations. I have also been nominated to serve on the Trust of the Rocky Mountain Vipassana Association, a volunteer-led non-profit to teach meditation techniques.

I&#39;ve also volunteered with myriad organizations in various capacities, ranging from providing presentations to teachers and social entrepreneurs, to leading workshops and panels on diversity/equity/inclusion and education.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As are many others, I&#39;m concerned and often overwhelmed by all issues being politicized and partisan, and for elected officials who continually seem unwilling to compromise in a professional and communal manner. All too often members of both parties seem more concerned with solidifying their own interests and political purposes than looking out for constituents and the greater good -- this is something George Washington specifically warned us about and we&#39;re seeing come into fruition. 

Especially in a state like Colorado, where so many voters are unaffiliated, the power of parties to draw districts should be minimized or eliminated. I&#39;m grateful that Colorado has independent commissions to do so, and I know the importance of well-drawn non-partisan districts. I&#39;m honored to be considered for the opportunity to ensure the next 10 years are designed to serve the citizens of Colorado, not political parties. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
People who know me will vouch for my willingness to engage with everyone, put judgment to the side, and have meaningful conversations with people who disagree with me. My search is for the truth, not for the upper hand. I seek common ground and shared values and vision, and I consider my ability to bring people together for a higher purpose to be one of my strong suits. 

In addition, in my past as a consultant, I have trained organizations and groups on effective collaboration, creativity, and consensus-building, so I have a great deal of background, knowledge, skills, and practical experience in building consensus and finding collaborative solutions for difficult problems.

I feel strongly that I&#39;d be able to build consensus in contentious environments if I think the cause is powerful and important enough. This redistricting commission feels like exactly such a cause -- I think ensuring the voices of Coloradans of all beliefs, backgrounds, and communities are valued and equitably reflected in our representation is one of the highest callings in the great democratic republic that is the United States of America. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I&#39;m an engineer by training -- my undergraduate degree is in Systems Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania and I love crunching numbers and analyzing data, drawing important conclusions to inform our work. I&#39;ve studied extensive statistical analysis, econometrics, and data crunching in my undergraduate work, and feel quite comfortable drawing conclusions and crafting a narrative from data.

In addition, as the CEO of a small but rapidly growing entrepreneurial non-profit, I am perennially thinking strategically and big picture -- What is the current state? Where do we want to go? How can we get from here to there? What needs to happen in what order? I do this all rationally and logically, and lay out steps in a clear process, but with an emotional connection to the end goal, and bringing along teams of volunteers to achieve that goal.
