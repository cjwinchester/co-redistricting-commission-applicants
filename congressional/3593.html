<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Volunteered for Broomfield Democratic Party in 2016 election.  Knocked on doors and did phone calls.
During 2020 election campaigns donated a total of approximately $100 to Vice President Biden&#39;s and Mark Kelly&#39;s campaigns.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
A member of the singles&#39; social group at Anthem Ranch development in Broomfield County.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I worked for Boulder County Public Health&#39;s Addiction Recovery Center (ARC)from 2007-2013 where I represented court-mandated clients at Boulder County drug court proceedings.  I also helped coordinate care with diverse service teams for adolescents and adults while working at the ARC.
From 2013-2015 I provided mental health services in long term care communities in Boulder County and the north Denver suburbs.  While doing this I advocated for client needs with long term care staff and medical personnel.
From 2015-2017 I worked as a contractor for the Department of Homeland Security at the GEO-operated ICE detention facility in Aurora.  Advocacy for mental health and medical services was an important part of my job in an environment constricted by budgets and multiple conflicting agendas.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
 I am excited that Colorado voted to separate the redistricting process from the political one.  Hence, I am hoping that this non politically structured process can do the best it can to deliver to Coloradans a fair representation.  I believe this is important so that Coloradans remain engaged/increase engagement in the political process.  They need to know that their vote has not been gerrymandered for political bias so that they know their vote counts.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I&#39;ve worked since I was 16, and I am now 74.  During that period I was a lifeguard/swimming teacher, a camp counselor for minority youth in Harrisburg, PA, an elementary/junior high teacher in Larkspur/Dougco, a retail and corporate banker who managed a client services delivery team in Philadelphia, a volunteer board president of a runaway youth program, the treasurer of an AIDS activist organization in Philadelphia during the AIDS crisis, an adjunct and associate processor of statistics and abnormal psychology.   In 1997 I returned to school for my doctorate and became a Licensed Psychologist and Addictions Counselor and have done the above-referenced professional work in CO since 2007.  As a teacher, I needed to collaborate with parents and students to make sure individual educational goals were met.  As a banker with an MBA in Accounting, I incorporated the analytical skills required to plan strategic initiatives, budget, and analyze financial statements with strong interpersonal skills to ascertain the needs of a diverse group of health care and educational clients and deliver effectively the services they needed.  Clearly, negotiating successfully with clients and internal bank constituencies was key to my team&#39;s success.  At that time I managed a service delivery team of 20 and was responsible for hiring, promoting, and firing staff as well as a budget of $3 million.  At Boulder County Public Health I worked with women and men court-mandated clients.  That work required clinical skill as well as political savvy and adept skill at knowing when to be assertive, or not.  As a contract psychologist at the Aurora ICE detention center, my clients came from Latin American, Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and Europe.  I had minimal first-hand understanding of the diverse cultures from which these people came, and I needed to listen carefully, an important part of my training in sales and psychology.  With the help of interpreters, I could try to understand the individual circumstances of each and how those circumstances affected their mental health as well as interventions that might help them.  I also worked with a supportive clinical team there, although corporate management did not always agree with clinical priorities.  Hence, it was important for me to advocate for clients, for something as basic as a dental appointment.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have an MBA in accounting from one of the top business schools in the country with an extremely analytical orientation.  Even my marketing classes were based on analytical models for things such as consumer preferences.  I worked for 20 years in retail and corporate banking using those skills to manage retail branches and staffs, their budgets and annual plans.  For the last 10 years of my bank employment, I worked in a specialized lending group within corporate banking.  That specialization required that I learned relevant regulations and reimbursement streams that applied to government, educational, and health care clients so that my team could evaluate the risk of lending and providing other services to these clients.  This also included extensive analysis of multi million dollar financial statements for customers such as the City of Philadelphia, The Philadelphia Gas Works, and Drexel University.  In addition to analytical and financial skills I have, I also have a keen understanding from my work in psychology about the importance of my using cognitive skills to calm and/or defer emotional reactions in situations where being able to think broadly and logically are important.
