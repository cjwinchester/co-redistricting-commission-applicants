        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Avi Bakshani</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Avi Bakshani
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Attorney / Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a Bachelor of Science Degree with a focus on Sociology, and a Juris Doctor.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80202
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated to the Clinton Campaign in 2016, Amy Padden for DA 2020, John Walsh for Senate 2020, Joe Biden for President 2020.  I volunteered for the Mike Johnston for Governor 2018 campaign, the Phil Murphy for NJ governor 2017 campaign, and this cycle I did some unpaid volunteer legal work for the Biden 2020 campaign.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I was an officer in the US Army until August 2016, and then in law school.  Since graduation I have joined the Colorado Bar Association and ran social media for the CO Veterans and Military Families for Biden organization.  In 2018 I also worked with an organization named Fair and Just Prosecution which was partnered with the Denver DA&#39;s office where I focused on local criminal justice reform efforts.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Working with the Mike Johnston campaign, the Denver DA office, and CO Veterans and Military Families for Biden, I have worked on substantive policy issues, as well as organizing.  With the Johnston campaign I did education policy work, focusing on the higher education needs of Coloradans who cannot afford a standard 4-year university experience.  At the Denver DA&#39;s office I worked on criminal justice reform, specifically the use of gun courts to reduce gun violence and recidivism amongst Denver youth.  And with CO Veterans and Military Families for Biden I worked on organizational efforts in the Colorado veteran community to promote voting, donating, and volunteering to support the Biden campaign.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on this commission for two reasons.  First, I am passionate about this subject and process.  I believe that redistricting is an essential part of American democracy, and I believe that doing it well is similarly essential.  Second, I am always looking for the best ways I can contribute to my community, both in Denver and in the larger Colorado community.  Taken together, because of my passion for this subject and my strong desire to contribute, serving on this commission would be perfect for me.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Over my military and legal careers I have developed teamwork and consensus building skills.  Much of my military career, as an officer, involved planning meetings that involved long discussions including complex variables and which ended with general agreement about the best way forward.  I learned that these decision-making meetings only resulted in agreement because of good communication skills and mutual respect.  I have built on those experiences and lessons with my time in the legal profession.  I have had multiple negotiation and meeting facilitation courses and real life experiences.  These more advanced courses and experiences have only reinforced my earlier lessons, that positive results only come when everyone uses good communication skills and maintains an environment of mutual respect; two skills I would bring to the commission.

My ability to be fair and impartial comes from my commitment to professionalism that was instilled in me at West Point and as an Officer in the US Army.  Professionalism, as I understand it, is dedication to the successful completion of duty through the application of relevant values over my own personal self interest.  In this case, those values include doing what is right for the people of Colorado, and promoting democracy over partisan gain. This is something I care deeply about, and I know that I will bring that professional ethic to the commission.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Analytical skills, logic, and reason are essential skills in the legal profession.  I have continued to practice and grow those skills throughout my time at Stanford Law School and WilmerHale here in Denver.  My time at law school also included a class on election law, which is where I became fascinated by the redistricting process and the underlying democratic values.
