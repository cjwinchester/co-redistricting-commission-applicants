<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
In my role as the President of the Aurora Public School Board, I have significant experience advocating for and considering the interests of community, students, teachers, and individuals with a vested interest in Aurora Public Schools.  I have organized community townhalls and partnered with a variety of individuals to ensure that people feel heard and have access to speak openly.  In addition, I have experience with unions and an in depth understanding of advocacy from that perspective.  I thoroughly understand the value of teamwork, and empathic response. Empathic response meaning, you listen to all sides for understanding, rather than to respond; even when you have difference of opinion.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the commission, because it is truly a unique opportunity to be among a diverse group of professionals seeking to ensure that Colorado has fair voting districts. Why should you choose me? I know that there are a number of extremely qualified individuals that have already applied for the role; however, I would bring something a little different to the table. I have a Doctor of Philosophy Degree in Human Services, which provided me with the skills to critique incorporation of social justice matters and to evaluate concepts, skills, policies, and initiatives that are fundamental to human rights.  Aside from my formal education, I have lived abroad in Argentina and Mexico. I have a passion for advocating for disadvantaged and/or marginalized communities.  I would ensure that disadvantaged, marginalized, and other communities of interest are kept intact when possible.  I would work with others to understand their perspectives, and most importantly, I would engage the public and ensure that members of the public feel heard and valued.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My ability to be fair and impartial is best portrayed in my role as the President of the Aurora Public School Board.  The role of a School Board Director is unique, we are nonpartisan, elected officials that have one sole job: To improve student outcomes.  In that role, it is important to understand that it is not possible to please everyone; however, you have to be willing to listen to differing perspectives.  You have to be accessible and open to engage judiciously and democratically.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am able to analyze a situation extremely quickly, and work with others to accomplish goals. I know first-hand that change is sometimes necessary. Complacency breeds stagnation. There are several elements that are critical to the applying logic and reason in problem-solving. First, it is imperative that you are aware of the Commission’s mission and vision. It is also important to be aware of the gaps/flaws, and create goals that are aligned with the main focus of ensuring equality and adherence to federal laws. Building relationships and rapport is critical; furthermore, when building the infrastructure to emit change, it is critical that you are thinking of all of the people/populations your decision will affect (i.e. rural/urban/etc). Sometimes you have to problem-solve creatively, especially when there may be &quot;red-tape&quot; (I don&#39;t mean violating law). By problem-solving creatively, I mean by taking an environmental scan of the critical contingencies that may impact the decisions that will be made. One such example of my ability to apply logic and reason to a problem was during my tenure on School Board.  During a community engagement session, a group of community members disclosed that they were concerned about students often being pulled from their classrooms to interpret in elementary, middle, and high schools. My first step in analyzing the situation was to research whether the District had a policy that addressed this issue; I was unable to find such a policy. During one of our Board of Education meetings, I spoke with my colleagues about the community engagement session, the issue that was proposed. I suggested that we draft a policy to ensure that there was adequate interpretation that did not disrupt students learning environments. Although the Aurora Public School Board operates under a policy governance framework, the other board members voted in favor to allow myself, another Board Director, and the District lawyer to create such a policy. The policy was created and the Board unanimously voted in favor. Aurora is the first school district in the nation to have a policy addressing this issue. Although this is one isolated example, I have a vast array of professional and personal experience with applying logic to situations and analytical skills.
