        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Douglas L Sanders</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Douglas L Sanders
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am an attorney at the National Treasury Employees Union (assistant counsel).  I am also an adjunct professor of law at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Juris Doctor, University of Michigan Law School (2005); Bachelor of Arts in Music, University of Michigan (2003).  I am also a certified mediator in Colorado, and am a active member of the Colorado, New York and Connecticut bars (Pennsylvania and New Jersey inactive).
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80206
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I donated a small amount of money to the Biden/Harris campaign this past summer.  I believe I did the same for the Clinton/Kaine 2016 campaign although I am not certain.  As for political activity, I have participated in some partisan and some non-partisan activity for many years.  On behalf of my employer, the National Treasury Employees Union, I door-knocked for the Clinton/Kaine campaign in Pennsylvania in 2016, and phone banked on behalf of various Democratic candidates nationwide in both 2018 and 2020.  I also worked as an election judge here in Denver in 2014 (non-partisan).  In addition, I have worked as campaign treasurer for Beth McCann, who was my state representative (HD-8) until 2016, when she was termed out and elected as Denver District Attorney.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am on the Workplace Law Program faculty board at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law, where I teach Employment Law and Employment Discrimination as an adjunct professor.  I am also a member of the Society of Federal Labor &amp; Employee Relations Professionals, and have lectured on behalf of the Colorado Bar Association Continuing Legal Education on the subject of federal labor arbitration practice.  In addition, although not an organization per se, I am a regular volunteer at the Kavod Senior Life facility in Cherry Creek, a Jewish elder care residence, playing piano and otherwise [hopefully] entertaining the residents during various holidays throughout the year.  I also serve on the Colorado Alumni Council for Honeymoon Israel, which is a non-profit organization seeking to connect various faiths and build community for both the Jewish community and the greater interfaith community of metro Denver.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My primary job responsibility is to represent several thousand federal employees, who are mostly in the intermountain West.  Hundreds of these employees reside in Colorado, working in various government agencies and stationed in metro Denver.  I meet with them (virtually these days) throughout the year to discuss their working conditions and related issues, how we can best resolve any problems, and work to organize them into a coherent group in order to best advocate for their interests.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I think this commission will serve the most vital and fundamental goal - to achieve greater fairness in the electoral process.  We all have our views and vote on those views, and that&#39;s ok.  But if our different views and votes overlay a fundamentally unfair process, then our democratic process is undermined.  I am a partisan like many of us, but the process itself should and must be apolitical, so that the views held by the most people should be represented in the legislature.  I am a proud Coloradan, and have always loved getting involved with improving my home state&#39;s political process.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
While I do not deny that I have partisan beliefs on a personal level, I do not think that one&#39;s personal political views are appropriate for this commission, and I would refrain from mixing my personal opinions with the important, non-partisan work that needs to get done.  My entire career is premised upon representing employee clients regardless of their political views.  Many of my client employees, although union members, differ quite a bit from my personal political beliefs, and I have never had a problem representing them zealously.  In addition, I also organize employees into forming and joining labor organizations, and often do so despite fundamental disagreement with them about the federal workforce and the role of Congress and the President.  I de-emphasize our disagreements and reduce everything down to what we agree on and move on from there.  In other words, I have no problem with acknowledging disagreement, because there is usually plenty of consensus to be had, and the work needs to get done.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a practicing litigator, I constantly analyze and interpret both the relevant law and regulations, and whatever the facts and needs are of a particular case or client.  I am required to separate out what I &#39;feel&#39; about a particular issue from what the merits of a particular point of view actually are, and after weighing the costs and benefits, I determine what the most prudent course of action is going forward.
