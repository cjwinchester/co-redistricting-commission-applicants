        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Nancy Ball Weil</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>

  Nancy Ball Weil
</p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Half-time Office Manager/ Bookkeeper for Colorado Youth Corps Association, a nonprofit support organization for youth corps statewide.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  BA in Russian Language &amp; Literature from Univ of Colo, Boulder (1977)
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80220
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My donations have been to advocacy organizations rather than candidates: Clean Water Action, Greenpeace, Planned Parenthood. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I was already serving on the Natural Resources /Site Management Committee of Bluff Lake Nature Center on 11/10/15. Among our challenges was fundraising then managing a critical project of dam repair; we also worked to humanely control a prairie dog population that denuded large portions of the 123-acre property, striving to maintain a population that would allow the limited grasslands to flourish. I&#39;m a member of Greater Park Hill Neighborhood Association. I continue to support Women&#39;s National Book Association, serving in my chapter, Washington, DC, on its Leadership Committee, and on our national board long before 2015. This year I was recruited to join the national Executive Board as co-Vice President, for the purpose of providing institutional memory and a balancing perspective based on many years of involvement.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
A Colorado native, I registered to vote in 1972 and that year was chosen in my precinct caucus as delegate to the county convention. There I was elected a delegate to the state convention. I lived in Maryland from 1989 - 2010. During that time I served as an election judge in my local precinct for 12 years. When we moved back to Colorado in 2010 (let&#39;s go home! my husband and I said to each other once our sons were grown &amp; out of the house), I attended precinct caucuses and in 2016 was a delegate to the county convention  I appreciate the grassroots level of participatory democracy.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Political drawing of legislative boundaries has always struck me as putting the voices of voters secondary to the aims of whichever party is in power. I think districts should be logically-drawn based on geography. I know Colorado pretty well, and I think I can be a fair and rational member of a commission. I do not want someone&#39;s vote enhanced nor diluted based on their party affiliation - fairness for all is the essence of a democratic system of government.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have served on numerous boards - at a co-op I came on at a time when the board was deeply divided and rancorous. Soon after election, by reminding board members we are small potatoes in the grand scheme of things, and not to get hostile with each other over details, we found ourselves able to sort out differences and make decisions by consensus. I worked with my sons&#39; Boy Scout troop for 14 years, serving for most of that time on the Troop Committee, and as its chair the last 6 years or so. We made decisions affecting the troop&#39;s finances, presence in our community, and scout advancement. It&#39;s worth noting that I tend to stay a long time with an employer: I worked with a Black couple supporting their businesses for most of 20 years in Washington, DC; I started my current job in January 2012. This is because I am instinctively helpful, competent in many areas, a good listener, and a careful speaker. A creative and original thinker, I tend to have a different perspective than most people - to me the world is not binary, and often I am able to say, &quot;but what about ---?&quot; 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a bookkeeper I have excellent skills working with numbers. I was in accelerated math classes in high school. My dad, an engineer by training and a professor (in CU&#39;s College of Engineering), encouraged rationality and logic.  As a writer, I blog reviews of books and films - I enjoy analyzing how authors and directors succeed (or fail!) in their efforts to capture their audience&#39;s sympathy and attention. I read widely and constantly, and for news I seek primary sources (a writer interviewing, doing research, etc) which I feel deepen my understanding of issues.
