<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe the local government makes the state great.  Rural areas do not have the same opportunities and challenges as the urban areas in our state.  In order to ensure we continue to have the our voices heard at all levels, I want to participate in the redistricting process.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As with any team project, all commissioners need to express their opinions regarding ideas put forth.  As a fellow team member, I would carefully ensure all participants share their thoughts, knowledge and concern for the betterment of our communities.  To do this, meeting will have agendas with specific topics that commissioners can research prior to the meeting.  Time will be built into the agenda for detailed conversation about the topics sharing both knowledge researched as well as interpretation and opinion. With my coaching background, I am skilled at listening, asking impactful questions and stay curious through conversations.  And, although I will share my ideas the overall goal is to create a redistricting plan that will be the most beneficial for the state in the coming years.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My process with a problem is to first analyze if I am working with the actual problem or a symptom of the problem.  I continue to search by staying curious and asking questions to ensure there isn&#39;t another problem that needs to be resolved.  Once the the true problem is established, I like to gather as much data as possible by doing my own research and calling experts to teach me areas that I am not knowledgeable of.  I use this same process with team projects by asking the full group to share their ideas and knowledge so we can learn as much as possible about the problem.  The next step is to develop the solution during which time I believe the more options the better the end result will be.  If we take just the first two or three solutions we may 1) be settling to appease the group or 2) not thinking through more creative solutions.  Final decisions come down to: cost, improved efficiency,  ability to solve the majority of the problem with time provided, and understanding that the final decision might not be 100% accurate but it brings the problem closer to the solution.
