<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am actively engaged and involved in civic, political, and policy spaces in my community and Colorado more broadly. My early political activity started when I had an internship in college working in the state House Republican offices. From there, I got to know members of the legislature and was hired as an aide for a state representative. I worked for that member of the assembly during the 2006 and 2007 sessions and volunteered on his state senate campaign. Over the years, I have volunteered with various candidate and issue campaigns (walking, phone banking, and sign and literature distribution). More recently, I ran for and was elected to two terms on the Aurora Public Schools Board of Education (2009-2017). I ran unsuccessfully for the state legislature in 2014. I have made no contributions to any campaigns or political organizations in the last five years.

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have extensive experience serving as a representative of others in my various communities. Examples include being elected by my community’s constituents to represent their voices on the Aurora Public Schools Board of Education; being elected by school board peers to represent board members across the state as the Colorado Association of School Boards president; and being selected by my faculty colleagues at CU to represent non-tenure track faculty on the Instructor-Track Faculty Affairs committee, just to name a few. Through all of these examples, I have learned how to be a voice for those who have entrusted me in the position; the importance of seeking out feedback from a range of stakeholders; and the necessity of seeking out those voices and perspectives often missing from the table. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Leading up to the 2018 election, I closely watched the conversations unfolding around Amendments Y and Z in Colorado and was encouraged when they ultimately passed. Their successful adoption signaled that Coloradans wanted a new process that prioritized fairness and aimed to remove undue partisan influences. Simply put, I want to serve on the Commission to be part of the process that brings this goal into reality for Coloradans. Colorado has been a national leader when it comes to voting access (for example vote by mail, vote centers, etc.) and how it conducts its elections. The establishment of these independent commissions is in that same spirit and I would be honored to be part of this work. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
It is no secret that there is unprecedented polarization, division, and tension across the country. As I talk with my neighbors and fellow community members, it is clear many are hungry for something distinctly different from the status quo. This is further evidenced with the record numbers of voters choosing not to affiliate with one of the two major parties. The work this Commission will be tasked with represents an important opportunity to provide that something different from the status quo – something that seeks to build compromise and create agreement. 
As a Commissioner, I would work to promote consensus and contribute to creating agreement through focusing on shared values. The distance between what at first appears to be opposing sides can often be closed or at least minimized when those “sides” work to identify common goals and shared values. In the case of the Commission’s work, keeping a north star focus on our shared goal of creating fair, competitive, districts consistent with the enumerated constitutional criteria (equal population, Voting Rights Act compliance, minimizing splits to counties, cities and communities of interest, and ensuring compactness), that give Coloradans representation would be one way to help promote consensus and agreement. Personally, I abide by the belief that we can accomplish more when we’re less concerned with who gets the credit. Operating as one of a board of twelve, I would be focused on creating agreement and what we can accomplish together as a Commission, rather than what I individually do or say.
I would consider myself to be fair and impartial and have held many roles that demanded this. Decisions I have made about policy, allocation of funds, etc. have had to be made with the utmost impartiality, focused on defined goals or desired outcomes. Most currently, as a faculty member at CU Boulder, I strive to create a classroom environment that is fair and impartial where all voices can be heard and discussion is thorough, but respectful. I accomplish this in part through setting clear norms and expectations and holding everyone accountability to those standards.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My friends and those who have worked with me consider me a problem solver. Through my academic training, I developed analytical skills including data analysis and a range of qualitative and quantitative research skills. I have continued to refine and apply those skills throughout my professional career. I have an extensive background in program evaluation and research ranging from experiences in a private policy firm, the US Government Accountability Office, the Colorado Department of Education, and now most recently in my current Presidents Leadership Class Academic Director role at the University of Colorado. In each of these capacities, I was asked to review large amounts of information to help answer a specific question or make a recommendation. At times, this work involved identifying ways to collect new or additional information and data that might have not been immediately clear. This could be in the form of conducting surveys, talking with stakeholders and content experts directly, or looking through historical documents to help establish context. On the Commission, I would bring these same skills to my work in reviewing available information, talking with community members across the state, and identifying additional information the Commission may need to obtain. Finally, all of this information is taken together and used to directly inform final decisions and recommendations. Using data and concrete information to make decisions helps promote transparency and fairness.
