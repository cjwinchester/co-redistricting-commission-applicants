        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Sandi Louise Lyman</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Sandi Louise Lyman
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Acupuncturist, self employed.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Bachelor’s of Science in Psychology
Master’s of Science in Traditional Chinese Medicine 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81211
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My past political activity has been centered around nonpartisan voter registration and civic engagement. I have not donated to any political campaigns in the past 5 years. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Acupuncture Association of Colorado, Board Member and general member. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Before studying Traditional East Asian Medicine, I had extensive experience in community organizing including directing membership and communications for two nonpartisan statewide coalitions that helped constituents learn how to participate in local, state, and federal government. As a Traditional East Asian Medicine provider I have been an active participant with my statewide association, serving on the Board of Directors for two years.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As a female business owner in a rural area, I believe I have a unique voice to offer to the process of redistricting. As a wife and mother of two young daughters I am passionate about doing my civic duty and showing my daughters that democracy functions best when we participate in it. Although I have a very busy practice, I believe it is essential that the Commission reflect the diversity of this state and as a queer, female business owner in a rural area, I believe I have a duty to offer my time to ensure the process is representative of the diversity that makes this state great. I have always had a passion for civic engagement and would love the opportunity to put this passion to work again. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
During my work with the statewide coalitions we often encountered issues of building consensus among our members and I played a key role in listening to people’s concerns and finding common ground to build agreement among seemingly oppositional positions. As a medical provider I have extensive experience in remaining impartial when helping patients navigate health problems, whether they are physical or mental. My personal philosophy is that the root of tackling a problem, be it a difference of opinions or a complex health issue, begins with listening. I believe listening to understand is a forgotten skill in our modern culture and that the foundation of building consensus begins with this critical step that subsequently informs further education, discussion, and comprise to reach a common goal. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
From a young age, I have always had a passion for problem solving. As child I always selected pass times that involved problem solving such as doing puzzles, and nearly drove my parents to madness with my version of data collection, which presented as a consistent string of asking, “Why?” I believe it was these traits that ultimately lead me to the medical field where I help people problem solve many times a day. Weather it is referring a patient to the emergency room for an infection they didn’t realize was serious, or helping a patient with a pinched nerve find pain relief through acupuncture, my day is filled with analysis and problem solving. These are skills I am excited to bring to the Colorado Independent Redistricting Commission.
