        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Timothy Kilcoyne</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Timothy Kilcoyne
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Psychotherapist at ComCor, Inc. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Bachelor&#39;s of Science in Psychology and English
Master of Arts in Clinical Psychology 
Licensed Addictions Counselor (application in progress)  
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80918
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I was a delegate for Andrew Romanoff&#39;s 2020 Senate Campaign 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
None 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
While I have not done anything official in this area, as a substance abuse counselor I have used my career as a way to represent the needs of my clients by serving them, advocating for criminal justice reform and improved public health policies with friends and by contacting politicians who represent me. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe the commission should be representative of the people and be filled by people who understand the people they are serving. I offer a younger voice as well as a LGBTQ+ voice to the commission and through my career have had the privilege of getting to know people from all over Colorado and hearing what their communities are like. Because of this, as well as my graduate education where I learned critical thinking skills, I believe I will be able to ensure that our districts are drawn in a fair and representative way.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My entire educational and professional background has been rooted in fairness and impartiality. In graduate school I was trained to use critical thinking skills and to ensure that, as a psychotherapist, I always remain impartial to my clients needs and always focus on what they need from me. This skill has only improved with my employment in corrections, where I often work with clients who are hostile towards me. I have learned how to not only set aside that hostility or my own emotions to be able to do my jobs, but also how to work with people who have very different ideals than I do. My clients often have their own agenda when coming into treatment and I&#39;ve had practice finding consensus with them, learning how to get along, and achieve meaningful results. I&#39;ve also had practice working with correctional workers who often have security objectives which are counterproductive to my clinical objectives with my clients. I&#39;ve learned how to communicate with these individuals in a way which addressed both needs and finds a way to compromise so as many needs can be met as possible. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My master&#39;s degree in clinical psychology was rooted in these skills, especially as it taught us how to diagnosis clients and set aside our emotions in order to apply logic and reason to the needs our clients were presenting. I&#39;ve furthered these skills in my career, especially when confronting issues such as debating whether to terminate clients who are becoming a danger to other clients in our treatment group, identifying when to push my clients, and managing my emotions when clients become aggressive or frustrating.
