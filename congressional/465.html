<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
My first experience with organizing was in 2001-2001 when I served as an Americorps community organizer for a year, working with residents of mobile home parks, lawyers, and advocates to represent the interest of mobile home residents and to lobby cities, counties and the state to promote affordable housing solutions. From that role I moved into the field of education and public health promotion. Recently as a member of the board of directors for the Colorado Mountain Club, I have represented the organization in a development and fundraising capacity to community partners. I have also represented my industry (outdoor/climbing industry) by participating on the board of advisors for the Warren Tech High School Outdoor Leadership Program as well as at the Climbing Wall Association annual conference, where I have participated as a panelist. In my current employment, I have also advocated internally to promote access to climbing for community groups and partners, which has led to long-term engagement with several community groups.

<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>

To my best recollection, I have donated to the following. I do not recall dollar amounts but all donations would have been in the $25-$50 range from what I recall: Hillary Clinton, 2016 National Redistricting Action Fund, 2017-2019 National Democratic Redistricting Committee, 2017 Ed Perlmutter, 2017 Color of Change PAC, 2016

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I was excited to vote in favor of Ammendments Y &amp; Z in 2018 because I believed it would put Colorado in a position of leadership when it comes to fair redistricting and elections. I believe strongly in fair elections, and while I have my own personal opinions on issues, I also deeply believe that everyone should have fair representation in elections, regardless of their opinion or position. I have been disappointed to see examples where redistricting became a tool used for voter suppression or gerrymandering and am very excited that Colorado developed a process to avoid these outcomes when redistricting. I believe I can support the process as a member of the commission with my background in leadership, communication, team-building, education, and data analysis and I would be thrilled to be of service to all Coloradans in helping to maintain fair elections.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am a big-picture thinker and in my job am frequently required to move a group toward consensus. Of course I have personal opinions on issues, but I do let let an attachment to a particular position cloud my ability to consider many perspectives and keep the larger objective in mind. I have found that my own opinions often evolve as I engage in discussion or a consensus-building process, so I have learned over the years that my initial position on may not be my final position - all of which is to say I am committed to achieving the larger goal/vision of my work than remaining attached to a particular strategy/tactic or position. I am able to listen actively and engage with people who hold perspectives different from my own to reach conclusions or take action. In a group setting such as this commission, I could play a role of facilitator, active listener, observer, and monitor (in the sense of monitoring if our work is on track or identifying if we are getting away from the bigger goal/objective). A major professional challenge I have moved through recently is a merger of two companies, and my role at a leader in the organization was to repeatedly express the vision of the company, the objectives/goals we are moving toward, gather input from stakeholders, and to have conversations that build buy-in to our new company&#39;s direction. In this process, I have been able to support two large teams in moving in a new direction, finding common ground with this direction, and generally feeling bought-in to our collective work and the outcomes. I like to approach problem solving as a collaborative learning process, where through the process we elevate the group&#39;s collective knowledge and wisdom to come up with solutions and make decisions that best serve our common goal. In this process, I may not always get &quot;my way,&quot; but I also know that a group can come up with more brilliant, practical, or elegant solutions that I could on my own, so I promote collaboration, learning, and always refocusing on our common goals. I believe I also am well equipped to be fair and impartial on this commission. I do not put my personal opinions/values above the larger goal, in this case supporting fair redistricting and fair elections. As a manager and supervisor, I have tried to apply principles of fairness to my teams, to reduce the possibility of favoritism or expression of bias. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Some of my past jobs and training have involved significant data-analysis and program evaluation, but regardless of my role I am a data seeker in my decision making process. And while I try to empathize with an emotional perspective, I do not let emotional arguments determine my decision making. As an example, in the customer service context that I operate in currently, an individual might bring up a complaint or may be vocal about an opinion. As convincing as they may be about their concern or opinion, I will dive much deeper into the root of the issue to determine if their concern is widely held or represents a larger problem, before making a decision based on one or a handful of comments. It can be tempting to make decisions based only on an individual&#39;s compelling argument or emotional plea, but I am committed to delving deeper and gathering more information to understand a problem better (and determine if it is in fact a problem) before attempting to solve it. In the real world, great data doesn&#39;t always exist, so to avoid analysis paralysis and be in a position to move forward, I supplement data-analysis with experience, seeking input, and discussing options, and considering potential outcomes before making a decision. I also keep in mind the larger goal - solving a problem should be in service of achieving our vision and mission. For example, my company&#39;s current vision is to transform the world through the experience of climbing (we run climbing gyms). When I receive input from customers, I will consider the problem of a member feeling excluded from the community much more seriously than the problem of our gym not having a sauna for member use. One problem (inclusion) is directly related to achieving our vision, the other (sauna) simply represents someone&#39;s personal preference for their gym experience, but solving that problem will not contribute materially to our overall vision. Part of the reason I would like to be involved in this commission is because I enjoy the process of problem solving and am excited to participate in the challenging process of redistricting for Colorado.
