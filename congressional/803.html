<h5>Occupation</h5>

</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I am one of those non traditional students who chose to create their own path. 
I began my career in architecture at Denver Institute of Technology after completing that I changed course to study emergency medicine. In today&#39;s language that would be considered a bachlors but in those days it was hospitals who taught the courses.
EMT-I, ACLS, PALS, St. Mary Corwin Hospital Pueblo.  I returned to the northeast and went to work, recieving certification as an ISO 9000 auditor from Lloyds of London Auditing school. Shortly after I was in a car accident that resulted in a traumatic brain injury. Having no employment prospects locally that would meet my needs I created a non profit to serve people like me (at that point I was a single mom with 3 kids on disability, my finances were tight) That non profit is now a national model for community engagement and youth development as recognized by Share our Strength and No Kid Hungry. Lots of education but no certificates to show.

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My political activity in the past five years has been limited to neutral activities. I have arranged for youth and a couple parents to go to the State Capitol to meet with legislators and to teach them that it is &quot;the people&#39;s house&quot;.  I have been active in sharing relevant legislation with our teen leaders and their communities. I have tried to get information to hard to reach populations so that they are empowered to make their own decisions. I have been involved in encouraging people who are immigrants or living in less than fortunate circumstances to register to vote and to exercise that right, although I have not been the one who registers them or involved in any voter registration drives.

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have spent the last 20 years advocating for those who don&#39;t have a voice. I founded and developed Kids At Their Best, a nonprofit dedicated to &quot;leveling the playing field&quot; for low income kids. For the majority of those years I was the only employee at the agency, managing the administrative work, the political connections and the day to day programming. As a director I have sought out at risk and often overlooked populations and brought them programs to empower them and to help them find their voice. We were one of the first organizations in the area to work on health equity. I have made a name for myself by taking a unique approach, bringing the information, programs and supplies directly to the neighborhoods where the people live. I don’t expect people to come to some fancy building to learn about things, I want them to learn directly in their neighborhoods where they feel comfortable and where they can share with their neighbors. One of my most significant accomplishments is employing 54 local low income youth to manage eight unique summer meal and enrichment sites in Morgan and Logan Counties. 90% of these youth came up through the summer meal program, many of them are immigrants and 82% of them are people of color, a unique staff make up for northeastern CO, collectively they speak 9 different languages so as a team we are able to communicate with everyone. I have a passion for empowering those who are lacking in power and I firmly believe that everyone should have a voice at the table. I am known for bringing in unique ideas and inventive ways to engage even the most remote populations. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the commission because I believe that I will bring a fresh and unique voice to the table that will take into consideration the differences we have in rural and metro Colorado and I believe that I will be an integral part to helping equally allocate the districts so that everyone, no matter how small, will be represented fairly and so that no party has the “upper hand” in an area. I have personally experienced the trouble with allocating districts in the northeast, we just don’t have the population to have a diverse set of legislators. I believe we could do better. Morgan County especially, is a unique spot in the northeast, with 26 languages spoken we have the second most diverse county in the state. That doesn’t reflect the entirety of the northeast however nor does it compare to metro counterparts, these demographic differences need to be recognized. I believe that my depth of knowledge of these difference will be an asset to the committee and that I will be able to bring an experienced voice for so many invisible populations.  I believe that my collective experiences of growing up in the northeast, living in the city and now working with many partners in the city and my work with underseen populations will give me a unique view point in helping to decide how to most equitably divide the state.  My secondary reason for wanting to be a part of this committee is to open a door for my students.  I have no doubt that my position, or others, on this committee will be filled with a variety of students in the future and I will be able to pave the way for more diversity and inclusion with upcoming generations. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Working with youth and children I have a unique ability to navigate both sides of any conversation and to help both sides find middle ground. The youth have taught me that fair isn’t always as simple as it seems, you have to take into account so very many facets of what is fair.  I can respect all of those views and help my fellow committee members to recognize some that they may not initially see. Working with the population that I work with, impartial is imperative. While I would like to have favorites, the whole goal of my work is to “level the playing field” for the kids I serve. I have learned many things about being impartial in the last decades and I have learned about my own internal biases, I have solid skill set in impartiality. We all know that the political dividing lines between rural and metro can run deep but what we need to recognize is that it is those differences that make Colorado such an amazing state. Our diversity is part of our beauty.  Growing up in the northeast I have a deep appreciation for tradition and the power of small towns, running an organization that empowers people of color to step up has given me a passion for everyone having a voice and working with a variety of foundations, businesses and people makes me love the city, its fast pace and its power. I have been blessed to have worked with many, many people across the state on many different projects and committees. I know that I can come to the table with an open mind and a passion for equality and that I can use those skills to help guide the committee to consensus on hard hitting issues. My experience in different areas allows me to have great respect for all sides of issues and I believe that I am just the person to help a committee like this navigate what is going to be best for Colorado.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
The work I do is based in logic. Poverty, discrimination and immigration are all hot button emotional issues. The only way to make progress is to apply logic and fact. Ihave had to do deep dives into research to justify how and why we operate our programs the way we do. The area I work in has little scientific literature to base our programs on so I have had to do some of my own research. We operate focus groups, survey parents, pose questions to youth to determine what works and doesn’t work within our programs. All of this data must be collected and analyzed in a logical manner to give us unbiased data. I have a lot of experience in analytics.
