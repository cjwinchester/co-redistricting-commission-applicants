<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Most of my adult life has been spent raising my family and teaching languages.  I have experience teaching in many different levels -- middle school, high school (including a local alternative school that serves low-income and struggling students), community college and university.  As such, I have had limited time to participate in groups, organizations or associations outside of my sphere of influence.  As a full-time teacher, I have belonged to professional organizations as well as committees within my school district and within my school.  It is within this sphere of influence that I have been most active.  I have led school-level and district-level professional developments, participated in district-wide cohorts, and engaged in committees at the school-level and district-level that advocate for student rights and teacher rights.  As a teacher, I believe that my profession is inherently linked to civil rights and justice in our society, through reflective teaching and guiding our children to think critically about the world they live in. As a teacher, I have dedicated my career towards bringing awareness to underrepresented populations - in particular, second language learners, low-income students, LGBTQ students, and students who donâ€™t feel that they are able to succeed.  As a world language teacher, my life has been dedicated to not only teaching vocabulary and grammar, but also teaching students about how different customs of living, linguistic diversity and social norms influence our own outlook on the world.  At the core of my belief system, I believe that despite these differences, we care about the same problems the world presents us with, and we have the same hopes and dreams for our loved ones.  When we are able to bridge opposing viewpoints, we are able to make progress in our country.   
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
As a native Coloradan, I have voted in every Colorado state and national election since I was 18 years old and consider it a great honor to be able to use my voice in the democratic process.  Since 2015, I have not participated in any campaign as a volunteer, though I have donated money to the campaigns of Hilary Clinton, Joe Biden, and a few political organizations like ActBlue.  Though my political affiliations have recently tended to sway left, I remain unaffiliated as I prefer to keep an open mind and I also view principled conservatism as a cornerstone of our nation&#39;s identity.  Since 2015, though I have made these, I remain committed to listening to both sides in a nonpartisan effort to value everybody&#39;s opinions, as I believe that all political beliefs have some validity and everybody&#39;s voice deserves to be heard.  In the end, every citizen must make a final choice when it comes to voting, and each vote should be represented fairly. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am a member of Colorado Conference of Foreign Language Teachers (CCFLT) and American Association of Teachers of French (AATF) and American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese (AATSP).  As a member of my school district&#39;s union (BVEA) and a building association representative, I have been trained in consensus-building strategies and have worked towards fair practices and positive communication strategies at my building level. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I would like to serve on this commission because as I enter a phase of my life where my children need me less and are growing older, I feel my time would be well spent focusing on furthering good in the world.  Part of the good in the world is assuring that all citizens in Colorado have a voice and are represented in their vote via fair voting maps.  As an unaffiliated voter, and a fluent speaker of three languages, I firmly believe that people on the commission should represent and be able to try to connect to everyone&#39;s experiences within our state, and not just a few.  As a Spanish speaker, I would be one (or hopefully one more?) person on the commission who could reach and communicate with a portion of our population in this state that is often underrepresented.  I also believe that at my core, I have dedicated the bulk of my life to being a problem-solver, to working with all people, and to bettering myself through my education and then sharing this education by helping to educate others.  I believe that these are all skills that would work to the benefit of the commission.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As an unaffiliated voter, I have spent my life listening to various perspectives in order to keep an open mind and be accepting of all kinds of people.  As a public school teacher, I have spent my life working to educate students and bridge divides in an empathetic manner.  I firmly believe that it&#39;s important for people in positions of authority to maintain impartiality; perhaps I do not always agree with the politics of my students or my students&#39; families, but they always deserve to have me (as their teacher) treat them fairly and without partiality in my classroom.  I do have a strong belief system that focuses on women&#39;s rights, the future world we are leaving our children, the voting rights that all citizens have;  however, I do not think any of these beliefs make me partisan or partial -- indeed, all of these concerns should be bipartisan and impartial, as they impact everybody.  I&#39;ve always thought that our societal and global problems are bipartisan; it&#39;s the solutions that people turn to that make them partisan.  In the commission, I would strive to be a problem-solver that involves all voices at the table, and all citizens within the state, while striving towards bipartisan solutions.  Also, because my perspective intrinsically is linked to my personal life experiences of being a native of Colorado, but also having lived as a foreigner in other countries, and as an English-speaker who has striven to put herself out of her own realm of experiences in order to become fluent in two other languages, I have a unique perspective with a focus on diversity that I can share with the rest of the commission. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Before I became a teacher, I considered becoming a lawyer.  At this early point in my life, I was faced with the crossroads of choosing one career over the other.  I took the LSAT and applied to law schools at the same time that I applied to graduate schools to study Spanish Literature.  I scored very well on the LSAT (95th percentile), which has a large focus on analytical reasoning, and believe that I would have made a decent lawyer because of my ability to analyze problems from different perspectives.  Instead, I studied for my M.A. and pursued a career as a public school teacher. I have never regretted my decision; I am confronted with an equal number of problems in my chosen profession that I get to seek solutions to on a daily basis (to be fair -- probably far more than if Iâ€™d been a lawyer!).  I have honed my problem-solving skills while dealing with the multitude of challenges that teachers face regularly: reaching difficult students; supporting students in emotional need; brainstorming creative ways to present ideas; planning for five different classes a day within 45-minute planning periods; working with limited resources (i.e., no textbooks, spotty technology); interpreting data in order to create a data-driven teaching practice; working in a technology-driven environment (with a sometimes lacking of technology available to students); collaborating in departments with challenging colleagues; working in schools with (sometimes) challenging leaders; etc.  As you can imagine, the list goes on and on.  Every day is a choice to bring myself physically to work for 8-12 hours a day, and to do the best job that I can, in a limited amount of time, with limited resources.  I simply confront problems with a problem-solving mentality, a smile and a positive and friendly attitude, and I work through them in the best way that I can ... and I return and repeat the next day. I would bring the same dedication to problem-solving to my work on this commission.
