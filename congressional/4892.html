<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>

I have testified on many,  many bills dealing with immigration, gun violence, suicide prevention, public education and other issues having to do with student safety, education and women&#39;s issues on behalf of the  on behalf of numerous organizations and groups.

<p>
I would like to serve on the commission to ensure that equity and fairness dictate the boundaries of districts and that decisions are made that enhance and encourage voting and representation of all voters.   I would like to bring my perspective to the table as a 4th generation Japanese American.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As an administrator in a schools district I had ample opportunities to facilitate groups and come to consensus.  Being an administrator in Special Education, it was my job to come out of Individual Education Planning meetings with a consensus on what was best for each child.  This was true no matter how contentious the participants were. These are the skills that I would bring to the commissioners. The most important skill is active listening--and then find common ground. Being fair and impartial was a requirement when dealing with special education parents, staff and other administrators. If I conveyed bias in any of the settings there would have been no hope of coming to consensus. Having an open mind and being creative are essential. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Being and educator and having gone through the process of attaining my Ph.D. I lean heavily on data driven decisions. It is vital to know what you need to know (data) and the parameters of the problem to analyze the data and the problem and  apply logic to come up with options for resolution.
