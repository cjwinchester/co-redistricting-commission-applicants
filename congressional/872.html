<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to have positions where I am able to advocate for Coloradans to promote their full participation in the democracy.  In my college years, I worked on civil rights issues.  My support of women&#39;s  equality and women&#39;s reproductive rights is demonstrated by my involvement in the effort to pass The Equal Rights Amendment and serve on the Board of Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood.  To promote women&#39;s full participation in Colorado, I was the Executive Director of The Women&#39;s Foundation of Colorado and served on the Board of the Women&#39;s Bean Project - both organizations serving low-income women on their path to self-sufficiency.

My service on the staffs of a governor, a member of the U.S. House, U.S. Senate and two presidents gave me a chance to make the lives of all Coloradans better - everyday if I did my job well, I helped open doors to services provided by my government.

As a reluctant retiree, I have volunteered at the Library to ensure that &quot;The People&#39;s University&quot; is open to all and able to provide services and materials to enrich its patrons&#39; lives.  I have organized volunteers to elect political candidates.  I have gone door to door canvasing.  I have given classes helping people better understand both sides of the issues on the Colorado ballot.

To support a greater voice for citizens in national politics, I served on the Board of Colorado Common Cause and became the first straight person on the Colorado Human Rights Campaign Board - seeking equality for the LBGTQ community,  and I was honored to be the first Anglo on the Latino Community Foundation of Colorado&#39;s Board, recognizing the growing and vibrant Hispanic population throughout the state and helping to meet their needs.

My life has been richly textured by these experiences and serving on the commission will give me a chance to help shape a dynamic, fair and unbiased division of the state&#39;s population into congressional districts that will well represent us in the decade ahead. As a senior member of Congressman David Skaggs&#39; staff in 1991, I got first hand knowledge of the process as the district was being reconfigured and the decisions affected the constituents and the Congressman.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I would like to serve on the commission to help create a carefully constructed compromise that proportions the congressional districts to best serve the constituents of Colorado in the U.S. House of Representatives.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
It is most important to create trust and respect for all members of the group first and foremost. Valuing fellow commissioners and the varying perspectives they bring to the table is essential to the group being able to reach the successful goal.  I believe that by reaching out, listening and learning from my colleagues without bias, I can be most successful.  Being fair and impartial is a matter of personal character, which I hope I would bring to the table as well.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Through careful research, past experience, consulting with others of differing views and being eternally curious, I have tried to bring as much information to the table to make the best decisions.  I also try to think how my current decisions will hold true going forward - one, five or ten years out - not just solve a problem in the immediate.  Finally, I work to develop options, so that if Plan A doesn&#39;t work, we can move to Plan B and beyond - I work to be a multi-tiered thinker, realizing that complex problems need complex solutions that can be implemented as straightforwardly as possible.
