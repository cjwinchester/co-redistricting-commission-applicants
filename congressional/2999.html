        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Jaime Tomas Aguilar</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Jaime Tomas Aguilar
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>JT Aguilar</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Marketing and Communications Specialist -- Community First Foundation
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  BA in Communications, Art minor; some grad school
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80204
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Since 2015, I have donated to my local City Council races and city races in other communities when i&#39;ve felt a connection to the candidate or the race. I donated to Jamie Torres for Denver City Council (non-partisan); Amanda Sandoval for Denver City Council, Kayln Heffernan for Denver Mayor and I donated to Gabriela Casares-Kelly for Pima County Recorder in Arizona. I was an active volunteer in the Jamie Torres for Denver City Council campaign in 2019.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Villa Park Neighborhood Association; Presentation of Our Lady Church pastoral council; ACCESO voter access board; Denver Parks and Recreation Advisory Board; Denver Park Trust Board; American G.I. Forum, member; Denver Press Club, member
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have been the president of my neighborhood organization for about 18 months and I have been actively on the board for five years. I have been a member of the association since I moved to this neighborhood in 2012. I currently serve as a stakeholder in the Neighborhood Planning initiative and on the West Denver Renaissance leadership collaborative.  I have been an advocate for the Native American community professionally and with the Latino, Spanish-speaking community with my service on appointed boards and commissions in Denver. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I would like to take my experience as a journalist, a community leader and involved citizen to be part of this important task at hand. I have the institutional knowledge and skills to provide leadership with empathy and active listening to bring groups together while sharing my experience with marginalized groups or others often not heard or seen.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe I evince the empathy and problem solving skills to bring ideas together from a diverse group of people. I have a grounding in finding compromise by guiding dialogue toward consensus. I worked on the severance negotiation team for employees after the closure of the Rocky Mountain News in 2009, which required both negotiation skills and an eye to finding common ground. I also served on a 1998 cold-case jury which demanded objectivity and reliance on facts and evidence to arrive at group decision. Finally, in my current work in my neighborhood organization, I actively hear both sides of a discussion and have to separate my personal beliefs in order to understand others&#39; views and work toward a fair and respectful place of balance. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My training and education as a photojournalist has given me the chance to see life though a variety of lenses. When I worked at a newspaper, I was able to critically evaluate an image and it&#39;s applicability to the story we were telling. This required my ability to see the big picture and evaluate our reader&#39;s experience as well. Now that I am in the nonprofit sector, I still bring my eye to imagery, storytelling, community voice to our work. We have to be able to produce something that makes sense to my neighbor while being grounded in data and facts. When i&#39;m faced with a problem, I think about my neighborhood involvement, my parents&#39; journey, my own lens and determine how to react. I&#39;m influenced by what i&#39;ve seen and experienced as well as by data and research.
