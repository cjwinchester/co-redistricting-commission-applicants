        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Calli Keener</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Calli Keener
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Calli Jackson</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Stay-home mom for the past 12 yrs. 
Prior to staying home with my four children, I taught 5th grade English in TX and owned and operated a Senior Adult Home Care company there. I also have call center experience in loan servicing.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  My bachelor’s degree is a BA in English from Howard Payne University in Brownwood TX, with almost a double major in Bible. I have half of a masters’ in English and half of Master of Divinity degree from Truett Seminary at Baylor in Waco, TX. We are Texans by birth and rearing, but prior to moving to CO, we lived in Wilton, CT for two years. It has been interesting to observe the different ways the municipalities’ and states’ governments where we have lived function and are run. I’d love the opportunity to serve our new state of Colorado (we’ll have been here 3 yrs this spring) on a redistricting commission. I believe I will be fair and equitable in my service and help insure the lines are drawn in the most appropriate manner to the good of the state in insuring rightful representation. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80007
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I don’t have any experience with any of these things in Colorado. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have never donated to a political campaign. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I’ve been a church member, though I have not yet moved my membership to the church where we attend here in Arvada, Arvada Covenant Church. I’ve been a member of the Three Creeks K-8 PTO, but not a very active one. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Honestly, it would have not been something I’d have even known about had Facebook not decided to advertise it to me, but I’ve been anxious to become involved in service of some kind for sometime; so when I read about the need for commissioners, I thought to myself, “I could do that. And I could do it in a way that is thoughtful and right. I’m political, but not overly so. I have time. I have concern that people be treated with fairness and have a great dislike for the gerrymandering that was at times so blatant in my growing up years in Texas. Maybe I’m naive to think it’s possible for politics to change from the acrid, acrimonious climate it’s slid into if decent people who respect the humanity of their neighbors irrespective of differences will take the time to step out and serve, but here I am in all my middle-aged optimism putting myself forward as a candidate to make a difference.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a middle child, peacemaking is in my bones. As a parent of four children ages 13, 11, 9, and 7, it’s not just in my bones, it’s in my daily repertoire. Having a background in education, ministerial training, and senior adult concerns, I have interacted with broad swaths of diverse people groups whose needs and rights weigh heavily upon me. As a student of the humanities, critical thinking requiring an ability to consider opposing viewpoints and live with the tension of occasional cognitive dissonance is part and parcel to the demands of study. I’m well qualified to consider multiple opinions and be gentle and firm in working toward consensus to the greater good. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I enjoy writing, so gathering relevant information, reading it, interpreting it, analyzing it, and synthesizing it into a product which others can then read to glean information or be entertained is completely in my wheel house. In my poems and writing, I provide social commentary on ordinary life experiences which I see as sacred. The art of writing is thoroughly couched in analytical skills, logic and reasoning and problem solving. As a commissioner, I’d be highly adept at gathering relevant information to consider and insure fair lines are drawn in redistricting.
