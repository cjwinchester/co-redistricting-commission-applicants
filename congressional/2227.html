<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In 2016 I caucused for Bernie Sanders. During the 2018 midterm election cycle I volunteered for Representative Jason Crow (6th Congressional District) and canvassed on his behalf in several neighborhoods throughout CD6. I also volunteered with Planned Parenthood as part of a non-partisan effort to help Denver citizens register to vote and find their polling place. In 2018 I worked as a member of Project Bridge to help organize and host the Colorado Science Policy Summit, where scientists learned how to engage in policy and the Colorado political system through workshops and case studies led by lawmakers. In 2020 I participated in several phone-banking and text-banking efforts lead by various organizations (Showing Up for Racial Justice, NextGen America, Red2Blue) to help get out the vote for the 2020 general election. I phone-banked and text-banked on behalf of federal-level candidates, including Joe Biden and Jason Crow, as well as numerous state- and local-level candidates across the nation. Locally I engaged with voters as a volunteer with No on Prop 115. Additionally, I undertook numerous non-partisan text-banking and letter-writing volunteer opportunities to help turn out the vote irrespective of party affiliation in Colorado, Florida, Alabama and Arkansas. I also volunteered in a non-partisan effort with Fair Fight to recruit poll workers in Georgia and other states to ensure that the right to vote is protected for everyone and that we have safe and legal elections. Since 2015, I have also engaged in several political protests, including the 2016 Women’s March, the 2017 March for Science, and protests in support of the Muslim community, the DACA and immigrant community, Planned Parenthood, and the Black Lives Matter movement.

Since 2015, I have donated to the following campaigns: Elizabeth Warren (Democratic Party presidential primary), Kamala Harris (Democratic Party presidential primary), Joe Biden (General Election 2020), Mike Espy (General Election 2020), Amy McGrath (General Election 2020), Jaime Harrison (General Election 2020), Jon Ossoff (General Election 2020), Raphael Warnock (General Election 2020). No single donation exceeded $100.

Since 2015, I have donated to the following organizations: Fair Fight, New Georgia Project, the Bail Project, Community Bail Funds, the ACLU, Vote Save America’s “Get Mitch or Die Trying” and “F*ck Gerry(mandering)” funds, Planned Parenthood, NARAL. No single donation exceeded $100.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Red2Blue – grassroots volunteer-based organization largely supporting Democratic candidates and campaigns in state- and local-level elections. I helped to organize campaigns by running quality control on candidate guides and text-bank scripts, fielding questions from voters to candidates, teaching other volunteers how to effectively communicate with voters, and engaging with voters both on behalf of partisan candidates as well as non-partisan get out the vote efforts. In this capacity I learned a lot about how state- and local-level politics are conducted across the country compared to Colorado while navigating new software systems.

Project Bridge – an organization of scientists working to bridge the gap between scientists and their communities by creating and supporting opportunities to foster public interest in scientific research. During my time volunteering with Project Bridge I helped to organize a non-partisan Colorado Science Policy Summit in an effort to connect scientists with state- and local-lawmakers and help scientists engage with public policy.

Girls Who Code – an organization that seeks to close the gender gap in the computing sector by teaching girls in K-12 school how to code while fostering values of bravery, sisterhood, and activism. I am volunteering as a club facilitator at Crawford Elementary School (Aurora Public Schools) for girls in 3rd-5th grade.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
For the 2020 General Election I volunteered with the Abortion Access for All committee to oppose the Colorado Proposition 115 ballot initiative by engaging with voters and advocating for women’s reproductive rights and a woman’s right to choose. For the 2020 General Election and the 2018 Midterm Election I volunteered on behalf of Representative Jason Crow, and talked with CD6 voters about what issues mattered most to them and what plans Representative Crow had to address their concerns.

In 2018 I worked with Project Bridge to plan and organize the Colorado Science Policy Summit. This was a non-partisan summit that focused on teaching scientists how to get engaged with public policy and state politics, and featured guest lectures from some of our local and state legislatures and other science policy experts. Additionally, I helped to write the Project Bridge Science Policy Career Toolkit (accessible on the Project Bridge website) to provide scientists with resources on how to become politically engaged.

Currently I am working with two different groups at the University of Colorado School of Medicine – the Section for Developmental Biology and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics – to create Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion efforts that address the systemic racism that pervades academia. We are also working to ensure we recruit and retain the best and the brightest scientists from all backgrounds with a special focus on reinforcing and building pipelines from our own local universities, community colleges, and high schools.

I am also currently facilitating a Girls Who Code club at Crawford Elementary School in Aurora. Girls Who Code seeks to close the gender gap in the computing sector by teaching girls in K-12 school how to code while fostering a strong sense of community. As a woman and self-taught programmer who is working as a bioinformatician, I wanted to give back to my community and help support and encourage girls who are interested in computer science.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I truly believe your vote is your power and is your chance to have your voice heard and represented by leaders who share your values and who you can hold accountable. However, voters can be silenced or suppressed in gerrymandered districts where politicians choose their voters instead of voters choosing their representatives. This is an issue that benefits both Democratic and Republican incumbents, undermining democratic representation at the expense of their constituents. In order to have a healthy and functioning democracy in our state, we need to ensure that all Coloradans are fairly represented. I am excited by the prospect of working with other Colorado citizens from different political backgrounds to redraw our Congressional and Legislative District maps so that the voices of all Coloradans are heard and represented.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I understand that not everyone shares my values and agrees with me politically – and that’s OK. I believe the goal of the commission is draw a district map that fairly represents all of our communities, regardless of their political affiliation. If the entire commission can approach this task with the intention of ensuring that the new districts reflect the communities in the region, I am positive that consensus will be reached. Colorado is a big and diverse state, from the Western slopes, to the Eastern plains; we are the proud home to many distinct communities that all deserve to be heard and represented in our state politics. If I were to serve on the commission, I would do my best to ensure that everyone leaves their biases at the door and focuses on serving the interests of all Coloradans. While I personally support progressive tendencies and values, I am open-minded and willing to hear different perspectives and engage in productive dialogue. 

Additionally, as a professionally trained scientist, I have spent years learning how to approach problems and ideas with a critical eye and evaluate them based on fact rather than emotion. A large component of my job as a scientific researcher is to examine data impartially and extract un-biased truths. Further, I often have to review scientific studies conducted by other research groups and evaluate them based solely on their execution of the scientific method and known literature, placing whatever personal feelings I might have for the individuals involved to the side. I am confident that I will be able to bring the same ability to be fair and impartial to the commission.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As someone with a STEM Ph.D., I have spent the better part of a decade honing and refining analytical and critical thinking skills. As a biologist, I need to be able to synthesize and understand complex content and consider the big picture of my project while managing details. Rarely do experiments work the first time, so I also need to consider alternative approaches and thus am constantly problem solving. Additionally, sometimes experiments do work but the outcome is not as expected, which requires an open-mind and critical thinking. Essentially, my daily job is built on analytical thinking and problem solving, and I am confident that I will be able to bring these strengths to my role if selected to serve on the commission.
