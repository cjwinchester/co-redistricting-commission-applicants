        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for David R. Wharton</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  David R. Wharton
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a self-employed management consultant for the past 15 years specializing in organizational psychology.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a BSc in Information Technology from McKendree University in Lebanon, IL.  I have attended numerous training courses throughout my ten year career in the Untied States Air Force as both an enlisted member and an officer. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80015
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I participated in &quot;Get Out the Vote&quot; canvassing in 2008 and canvassed in 2012 for President Obama.  I reviewed the FEC database and I contributed $15 in September 2018, and I believe it was for Elizabeth Warren.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am active in my HOA, but I have no held an official position. I&#39;ve participated in two management consulting organizations: the Institute of Management Consultants and the Professional Independent Consultants of America.  I was the foreman of the Arapahoe County Grand Jury for a year in 2014.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I&#39;m gay and I advocated for years on topics relevant to the LGTBQ community, such as marriage equality and job protections, but in mostly informal ways. My management consulting work is mostly related to organizational behavior and to a large extent, that is work that requires bringing groups together to find compromise. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have the flexibility in my schedule and I think independent redistricting is an extremely important political goal. I have a few skills that may be useful to the commission and I&#39;d love to serve if I&#39;d be useful.  The commission is also a way for me to give back to the State.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I think my experience as a management consultant may help there. As you&#39;re aware, a lot of organizations bring in consultants to sell &quot;bad news&quot; but one of the benefits of doing that job is honing an ability to hear what someone is really saying when they object or disagree. I think consensus is best built by making sure everyone&#39;s ideas are represented and then discussed. There is a degree of facilitation that&#39;s required just to get ideas out on the table and then, that facilitation gives way to helping the group prioritize issues and that facilitation gives way to guiding the group through a process to make a decision. I have done that a lot and I&#39;m comfortable in those kinds of situations. I think I can be fair -- I grew up with a twin brother and one thing parents of twins enforce is the ability to share. I&#39;m not worried about impartiality because I think that&#39;s the reason for the commission: to create impartial districts that favor no one and -- more importantly -- disfavor no one.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I started my career in the military as a computer programmer. Programming is an exercise in logic. The type of programming I was doing in 1983 may seem trite now, but we were creating three-dimensional boxes to &quot;fly&quot; aircraft through that avoided ground obstacles and allowed for safe landings and take-offs in real time in war zones where predetermined instrument procedures were impossible to obtain. Throughout my military career, I was faced with the need to analyze and solve for problems. And I was rewarded for it -- landing a prestigious posting as an exchange officer to the United Kingdom&#39;s Ministry of Defense.  When I left the military, I think the reason I became a consultant was because I had a knack to look at a situation, break it into its constituent elements and understand the potential and real conflicts that would affect change to that situation.  In addition, I play poker recreationally and a lot of poker is situational analysis and determining a line of action to take in any given hand.
