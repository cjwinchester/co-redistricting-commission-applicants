        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Kristopher West</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>

  Kristopher West
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Kris</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Boulder Valley School District
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Associate of Applied Science in Computer Science
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80516
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I&#39;ve done volunteer work for Colorado Republicans from time to time. I&#39;ve worked our voter information booth at Erie events on a few occasions and helped hand out campaign literature. I also helped gather signatures for the national popular vote referendum.

I might have given small donations to a few state legislative candidates or the Colorado Republican Party but the only donations I can distinctly remember is donating $10 each to Georgia&#39;s US Senate Candidates Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue last night.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
The only political organization I&#39;ve been a part of since 2015 has been Weld County Republicans. I have been a precinct committee person since 2018.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I am a precinct committee person for Weld County Republicans. I also served as a delegate to the Weld Republican Convention in 2020 and 2018. In 2012 I was a delegate to the Colorado Republican convention and I have also served as a delegate to Boulder County Republicans and Larimer County Republicans when I lived in those respective counties. I have also done some small scale volunteer work with a few campaigns for state house and school boards such as canvasing and helping with web design.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Colorado&#39;s redistricting process has historically been vicious. From the infamous &quot;midnight gerrymander&quot; my Republican Party attempted to pull off in 2003 to the cynical attempt by Democrats to propose maps dividing the western slope and forcing the process into the courts in 2011, both parties can be said to have historically acted in very bad faith. The current maps were drawn for largely partisan reasons and leave much to be desired. I reside in the 4th Congressional District and I live in Weld County but somehow our district also contains much of Douglas County. The 6th district seems to have been drawn more for the purpose of unseating former Rep Coffman than accurately representing Arapahoe and/or Adams county and the 7th district seems like it too could&#39;ve been drawn in a manor that was both competitive and more regularly shaped. In my opinion, the current districts do a poor job of giving Coloradoans a clear path to accurately electing people who represent their communities.

Many predict the 2020 census will increase Colorado&#39;s House delegation by a seat, bringing us to a grand total of 8 districts which makes it all the more important for these districts to be redrawn in a way that is fair and competitive. Colorado is ostensibly a swing state but the 2012-2020 maps effectively left Colorado with only 1 competitive district, district 6. While it is clear Denver and Boulder clearly want to be represented by Democrats and Colorado Springs and some of the rural parts of the state wish to be represented by Republicans, I believe that, assuming we are allocated an 8th district, it would be possible to create 4 districts that were competitive not just in Congress but that were also competitive in the State Board of Education and CU Board of Regents elections while also adhering far more than the current districts to the boundaries of counties and cities within our state. I would love the chance to help Colorado&#39;s voters have a better chance at fair representation.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I&#39;m a Republican voter who, in my professional career, works for Boulder County Schools. In the past I&#39;ve worked for Adams 12 Schools, Poudre Schools, NOAA and Workforce Boulder County. Given my personally political opinions, working professionally with people I don&#39;t align with politically has been a fairly routine part of my life. While I aim to be one of the Republican members of the commission, I&#39;m not aiming to see districts drawn that favor my own party. I&#39;m aiming to work with the other members of the commission to draw districts that clearly and fairly represent common communities of interest and that give voters a fair chance to elect people who accurately represent them. Redistricting for the US House seats is likely to attract fairly substantial out-of-state interest groups and has historically been a very ugly process in Colorado but I believe voters passed Amendment Y because they wanted to take some of the venom out of the redistricting process and I hope I can help work with the fellow Coloradoans of both parties on the commission to come up with a fair compromise.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am a computer technician by trade and most of my job involves researching a problem, use of process of elimination and analytical thinking. For the process of redistricting, I actually believe computer software might be among the most fair and impartial ways of drawing districts. Geographic information systems software (GIS) could be used to draw up districts that allow for the effective representation of communities of interest. Such software could easily propose districts that have similar income levels, similar occupations, that fairly represent different demographic groups and ensure fair representation and competitiveness while also adhering to existing political and geographic boundaries.
