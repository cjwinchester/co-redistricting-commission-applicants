<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have given minor donations to Republicans Presidential campaigns and to the Colorado Republicans, as well as the national Republicans in various small amounts.  I have given to an occasional Republican running for US House or Senate.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Local Republican party precinct committeeman, county and state delegate.  I have volunteered to help with singing for my Church, and assist with grounds cleanup, and festival for the Church and school.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have not done much organizing, representing or advocating since my almost 20 years in Colorado
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to have balanced and fair elections in the State of Colorado.  I want an equitable distribution of the seats of Congress from Colorado so that when they are elected they truly represent a reflection of the Congressional District they are from, and that they have a equitable weight of the people of Colorado, and of whatever due Federal funding and attention due a Colorado Congressional District.

From my Science background, I have an inclination towards numbers and proportions.  I understand clearly what a square or rectangle are in contrast to a winding tail zig-zagging across a map.  As a local truck driver, I am intimately aware of geographical and topographical boundaries and borders.  And making Congressional Districts more Uniform in shape and follow more closely to geography and topography will help them seem more fair to most people and to remove (at least more so) the politics and games from the various Congressional Districts in Colorado, thus helping people to feel the elections and distribution of Federal funding might be more equitable to the population as a whole.

With my background in Philosophy and Theology, and my numerous security checks, I hold only the highest regard for and implementation of ethics and honestly.  Something this process has begged and desired for many years.  I hope I can help.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I think we all want to find a balance and equitable and fair distribution of the vote, and of Federal funding and consideration.  Keeping things forthright and honest is always the best way to be able to have productive discussions and decisions.  If members of the commission have preset figures and calculations to favor themselves or their party, a compromise will be hard to navigate.  Then, the process ends much the way it always has and the redistricting proposition was a big waste.  I think everyone ought to give each other deference to make sure we succeed to be as fair as possible, and not to force situations that become only, or purely political.  We need a impartial setting through the redistricting to truly allow each region and group to feel they can self-determine and grow together most fruitfully for thier community and as a State.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My science background brings basic numbers and analysis to the table.  My Philosophy and Theology lend itself to logic with a flavor of trust.
