<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I was born and raised in Colorado to a mother who grew up in Boulder and a father who grew up in Colorado Springs. I&#39;ve lived in or visited most of the bigger corners of the state most of my life. Living in Colorado and growing up in it as a purple state, where those on the left and the right had to work and compromise on important political decisions, has left a lasting impact on me. If we can&#39;t trust the systems we choose to elect our leaders, we can&#39;t trust our government which would undermine our democracy. I believe strongly in civic engagement and responsibility and I want to take my knowledge of systems &amp; design from both my career and my political volunteering and apply it to the next wave of redistricting in order to ensure the continue existence of a fair and balanced system.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a software engineer one of the best skills you can hone is your ability to build consensus and buy in from everyone involved in a project. If you can&#39;t establish at least some level of baseline trust people will hide or work against each other, even if they are ostensibly trying to solve the same problem for the same reason. I expect a problem like this to work in a similar way, but with maybe a little more emotion tied in. Fundamentally though I expect everyone on the commission to want the same thing, a system that is fair and doesn&#39;t tilt too far in any one direction.

Both of my grandfather&#39;s were veterans, as were my father and his brother. From an early age I was taught the value in duty and in being able to serve and execute a mission. I take my responsibility as a citizen very seriously and with something as sensitive as this, one of the worst things I can think to be accused of after the fact is of being a partisan hack. I love Colorado and I want to ensure that everyone in the state feels they are being fairly represented in all mechanism of government.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Being a computer scientist, I spend all of my day analyzing problems and approaching them in a logical manner. If you can&#39;t break things down into discrete pieces for analysis and reasoning, you just can&#39;t build software. It&#39;s as fundamental as that. There is also plenty of computer science research on drawing fair electoral districts based on population and density to draw upon.
