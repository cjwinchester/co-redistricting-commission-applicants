        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for John Salsbury</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  John Salsbury
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>John Robert Salsbury</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently employed with Leadership for Educational Equity as a communication specialist. I also own my own businesses as a political and communication consultant as well as being a partner in a digital communication company.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a bachelors degree from the State University of New York, Albany.  I have received a public speaking certification and I have completed a Harvard Executive Education Program for Senior Executives in State and Local Government. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80229
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
$100 - Angela Williams for Senate (2019).  $200 Steve O&#39;Dorisio for Adams County Commissioner (2018). $100 Joe Neguse for Congress (2017). $100 Angela Cobian for Denver Board of Education (2017). $100 Steve O&#39;Dorisio for Adams County Commissioner (2017). $50 Dan Pabon for State House (2017). 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am not a formal member of any associations or organizations, however I do a lot of advocacy work for educational equity, program funding, and protections for workers and families. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have dedicated my career to expanding workers&#39; rights, giving people a voice in their workplace and community, and promoting educational equity and opportunity. As a former political organizer for a major labor union, I have a lot of experience with community engagement, one on one organizing, and and political advocacy work. I was asked to travel across the country and work with people from all corners and backgrounds to build programs that accomplished their goals. I also am proud to work as a communication specialist with teachers who have decided to take leadership roles in their communities and get civically and politically involved, often times by running for elected office. Every community is unique. Every policy position or issue has intended and unintended consequences - and constituencies of support and opposition. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am very engaged at the State and County level and have a solid understanding of redistricting and what it means. I believe in a system that creates fair lines for representation and is inclusive of communities and local interests around the state.  I also understand that this is a very important piece of our Democracy. I have nearly two decades of experience working with voter files and have a deep understanding of the math that goes into this work. I would like to use my knowledge to help the commission achieve its goals. I believe my experience and macro-level knowledge of our political system, district lines, and representation would make me a great teammate for others on the commission.  I believe it is of great importance that we have some folks on this team that understand the consequences of this work and that this is not just a matter of community, but also a complicated math problem with long-term effects on all people in the State of Colorado. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The redistricting commission needs to determine new districts for the next decade of representation.  It&#39;s essential there is an outcome and the commission succeeds in its work. I have political bias like most other Coloradans, but I am a Coloradan first. I believe it would be easy to reach consensus when we stick to the principles that guide us. This is not an opportunity to pursue an agenda, this is a privilege with a lot of responsibility. I work well with others, I seek resolutions to problems, not to make them worse. I believe my leadership style is well aligned with consensus building.  If given the opportunity, I&#39;d be happy to further describe my ability to be fair and impartial - I can promise as an applicant that my commitment is to the process and to transparency and fairness.
