<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Over the last five years, I have been volunteering at my children’s charter school. I serve on the Community Outreach Subcommittee, where I have set up and help run the Mother/ Son Events, the “Miner Mania” Charity Events, and the Monthly Staff Appreciation Luncheons. These luncheons are provided by the families at the school for the 155 staff members. My co-chair and I coordinate this massive effort ourselves six times a year.  This year, we are raising donations and sending the staff monthly gift cards given the restraint on our abilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, I spent two years setting up and helping to run the school’s annual fundraising event called the “Miner Gold Rush”. I even worked at my son’s preschool on their annual fundraising committee for two years.
This year, I joined the Welcome Committee as the Secretary for our neighborhood’s Community Association. We meet and discuss how to make our new neighbors feel welcome, and then follow up with welcome baskets and make ourselves available for any questions. Our master planned community has been growing rapidly so it is a lot of work.
I have also volunteered for Colorado’s chapters of Dress for Success and the Special Olympics. And, we donate quite often to the ARC and to the Precious Child. We also work with a church group to make winter survival goody bags for the homeless.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I believe I’ve voted in every election. It is very important to me to vote and exercise my right. I enjoyed door knocking for President Barack Obama in both his first and second campaigns. It was the first time I felt very strongly for a Presidential candidate and his platform. I met lots of very interesting people, some with similar beliefs as me and some without. Also, I went to the local campaign offices and meetings.
During every election year, I donate a handful of money to the DNC and the last two Democrat Party&#39;s Presidential campaigns.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to be a part of Colorado’s history. I’m excited to have the opportunity to engage in this historic redistricting process to ensure elections are fair. I would like to work with my fellow Coloradans reviewing the districts and changing them if necessary to properly represent the voters. I would really like to be chosen as one of only 24 voters to serve on Colorado’s first Independent Citizens Redistricting Commissions.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I enjoy working with others by communicating my thoughts and yet still listening to what other people have to say. Once everyone has spoken their minds, it would be our duty to find the middle ground. There has to be some give and take on all sides to come to a consensus. I believe I can be fair and impartial because I look at issues from different angles and I will not be concerned to justify myself in order to win. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
By nature, I am a very analytical person and I use logic in all of my decision making. In my professional career, I worked as an IT project manager and a quality assurance engineer. Both of these positions required meticulous detailed organization and the application of logic and reason for multiple types of problems. There is generally a way to solve a problem if you analyze it properly and allow yourself the chance to think outside the box.
