<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Most of my adult life I have worked with the public, be it in law enforcement or customer service and I have come to appreciate the backgrounds, insight and diverse opinions and perspectives I have been exposed to from people all across the world.  People want many different things unique to their own situation, but most of it can be summed up in the general consensus of being treated fairly and equally.  Unbiased electoral maps in our state is the first step in creating a true and just process through fair and equal representation at the voting booth and thus through elected officials.   I would very much like to be part of the solution for an issue which has been troublesome to many parties for a very long time.  No political party should have an unfair advantage over another simply because the way lines are drawn on a map.  Fair and equal is the order of the day.  It will take a great time commitment, dedication and the ability to communicate with people who represent a variety of views and perspective and to be able to find common ground and reach compromises.  I feel strongly I possess these skills and qualities to be successful.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Common sense, communication, the ability to listen to other points of view and to speak out when needed.  My military background was in law enforcement and my postal background was in customer service.  Experiences in both fields lend themselves to recognizing a situation, problem solving, and reaching compromise when necessary.  I have an ability to be both tactful and direct when interacting with people from all backgrounds and walks of life.  Team work is key.  As a Drill Instructor in the Army several times I was tasked with molding a well functioning platoon which included young recruits from all around the country.  Some of these young people came from the streets of the inner city to farm kids from small towns and remote rural settings and they had to be taught to work as a team to achieve common goals.  These experiences served me well throughout my life as I would often draw upon my understanding of people in order to better understand a situation and resolve problems.  I continue to draw on those experiences even today.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Several things come to mind regarding the skills necessary to be successful with this project.  Communication both listening and speaking as well as being able to convey thoughts in writing.  The ability to work with others and build a team atmosphere with the hopes of achieving fairness and equality with the end product.  Thinking outside the box and listening when other do the same thing.  Realizing that while not everyone may agree on all things at all times, it is important to form a consensus as a team with the emphasis again being on fairness and equality.  The ability to look at the facts as they are and be honest with the team as to how it looks and listen to team members as to what they see.   Again, I feel my military background in law enforcement and my many years of working in customer service in the post office has provided me with many opportunities to see problems and situations from various points of view and to apply workable solutions as much as possible.  I want to emphasize the importance of listening and communicating.  I believe I have these skills.
