        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Joshua Curtis Black</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Joshua Curtis Black
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am a public health research scientist employed by Denver Health and Hospital Authority. I study drug abuse on the national stage.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I hold a doctorate from the University of Denver in biophysics.  I&#39;ve been formally trained in statistics and the hard sciences. My career since school has been as a researcher in public health studying drug abuse across the nation. Relevant to this application, I&#39;m an expert in statistics, demography, and spatial mapping. More broadly, I&#39;m also an expert in epidemiology, research study design, and technical writing.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80226
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I have not represented or organized for any political organization.  I have experience participating in scientific societies as advocate for students and presenting my scientific work.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am generally only active as a voter. I have voted regularly in elections since moving to Colorado in 2003. I do not consider myself affiliated with either party. I usually split my ballot between Democrats and Republicans, as I assess each candidates based on past experience and stances on issues. I felt the 2020 election ballot, in it&#39;s entirety, is the most important election of my life.  Only in 2020, my wife and I have donated a small amount of money to Kamala Harris&#39;s primary campaign. That was the first time I donated to a candidate in my life.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I&#39;m currently a member of the American Statistical Association. Prior to this, I was a member of the American Chemical Society for  8 years.  I am not a part of any political organization.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe districting must be scientifically based so that votes from citizens best represent the will of the people. Modern statistical and GIS techniques should be employed so that demography and geography are leveraged for the benefit of the people. Independence of the commission is of utmost value, so that partisan influence is minimized. Colorado&#39;s split demographic among Republicans, Democrats, and Unaffiliated is an ideal design for the commission.  I wish to represent the unaffiliated voter, since my political outlook is a centrist attitude, not skewed toward one party or another. I believe my background has the right technical skills, but since I am not politically active, I would fit the criteria for an unaffiliated member of the commission.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my professional work, I regularly communicate complex scientific ideas to non-scientists in government and industry. We learn skills that help those not familiar with science to understand the science. I think this experience will be helpful in this commission. As commissioners, we must find consensus on the best districts to represent the citizens of Colorado. I would need to bridge understanding between commissioners and between the commission and the public.

I work for a nonprofit safety net hospital. We provide statistical analyses to the pharmaceutical industry and to federal government regulators, where our independence is crucial to our success. Our role is intentionally and specifically impartial so that we might provide the best analysis for government to develop policy, not favoring either side in an evaluation of drug safety. We must be impartial so that medicines are proven to be safe and effective for the benefit of the populace. I believe my impartiality as a public health scientist to pharma and regulators would be best utilized by this commission.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a PhD scientist, on a daily basis, I employ complex statistical analytics to solve scientific problems (as demonstrated in my published scientific work). Before a solution is discovered, we must correctly frame a problem and the goals of any analysis. Once a problem is correctly framed, then a solution can be sought. I build defensible bodies of evidence to support public health initiatives in my professional work. In this commission, I would employ the same skills to the redistricting task. The redistricting problem must be correctly framed, the tools to solve the problem characterized, and the solution well defended logically.
