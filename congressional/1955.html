        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Marianne Z. Wamboldt</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Marianne Z. Wamboldt
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Marianne Wamboldt</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I retired from the University of Colorado School of Medicine in July 2020.  I was a Professor of Psychiatry and am now Professor Emerita.  I still mentor some junior faculty, occasionally teach, and work as a consultant on a federal grant helping provide more access to mental health care for depressed teens. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  BS magna cum laude - Marquette University - 1976
MD - University of Wisconsin Madison - 1981
Residency in Psychiatry - University of Wisconsin Madison - 1985
Clinical Research Fellowship  - NIMH - Bethesda, MD - 1986
Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Fellowship - University of Colorado - 1990
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80220
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I must say that I have not done as much as many.  I see myself mostly as a Democrat, with some conservative social values, and a strong sense of social justice from my faith upbringing.  Like our country, the Catholic Church is quite divided now politically, and I am on the progressive side of it.  I have spent more time working with Work (Academic) Organizations than either church or politics.  Within my profession, I was Chair of the Pediatric Mental Health Institute at Children&#39;s Hospital for 10 years.  I have served on a large number of national and international professional committees.  I have served on a large number of committees at National Jewish Health when I worked there for 14 years, and at Children&#39;s Hospital while I worked there for 16 years, including the Medical Board.  
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated to Andrew Romanoff&#39;s campaigns, as well as small amounts to Act Blue to support a variety of Democratic candidates including Biden. I am a founding member of the AACAP PAC, which is the PAC for the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.  We support both Republicans and Democrats at the Federal level who support issues that improve child mental health. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have served as a member and President of the Family Process Institute Board from 2009 - 2018.  I consult to them now.  Their website (https://www.familyprocess.org/about-fpi/) indicates &quot;As an independent, multidisciplinary, transnational organization, we assert equal rights and just treatment of all individuals, regardless of race, nationality, class, gender, sexual orientation, religion, language, age and ability. We dedicate ourselves to promoting a more inclusive and socially just world by developing and exchanging new theory, research, applied practice and policy related to diverse families and systems.

FPI seeks to be a global voice for scholarly work and to shape future directions for research and practice toward ameliorating suffering and enhancing the lives of individuals, couples and families through our journal, Family Process.&quot;

Since 2016, I have been the leader of the Colorado Sunday Solidarity group, which meets monthly  (less since COVID) to discuss local and national issues.  We helped support Jason Crow&#39;s election.  We are loosely part of the Indivisible Group  led by Jody Rein in our state. 

I had been very active in St. Elizabeth&#39;s Catholic Church till about 2018, serving on the Faith Formation Committee and in the Choir.  Since then, I have followed our pastor who was transferred to Regis University and attend Catholic Mass and prayer services there.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I think elections need to be fair for all.  The discrepancy of popular vote versus gerrymandered votes over the decades I have voted has become larger and larger.  That is not fair.  It is not a way to represent each American citizen.  I want the new district lines to be fair to all.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a psychiatrist, I was trained to find common connections, help people express themselves in ways that can express their feelings without attacking others, try to bring consensus to groups.  Unlike psychiatrists trained as &quot;Freudian&quot;  I was trained in family therapy and ways of working with groups.  As Chair of an Academic Department, and as President of an National Board, I have worked with people of all backgrounds, races, religions, gender identities, political persuasions, etc. I think I am usually able to bring harmony and energy to groups. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I was an academic psychiatrist where I was also trained in clinical research and did a large amount of research throughout my career.  I loved the data analysis part, and considered myself somewhat of a geek in using statistical programs to analyze data.  I also am a classical pianist and love Bach, who is quite logical.  This type of thinking comes easily to me.
