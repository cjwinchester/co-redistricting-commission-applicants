<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As one of my daughters is adopted from Korea, I have been an advocate for adoptee rights, and respect for the Asian race.  I served as Newsletter Editor for our adoption agency, and did what I could to educate families about Korean culture.
When my children were in elementary school, I participated in the PTA, eventually serving as president.  I made it a point to involve as many parents as possible, especially those who were marginalized.  My ability to speak Spanish helped a lot.  I also initiated English Language classes at the school, and inexpensive after school enrichment, with scholarships for students who needed them.
As a teacher for Denver Public Schools, I worked with primarily Spanish-speaking families.  I visited each family, and tried to provide resources for them to provide the best for their children.  Sometimes this included working with school social worker.  As a teacher for Douglas County Schools, I worked with students from many diverse backgrounds, and assisted their classroom teachers in  providing language and culture friendy environments.
As a private citizen, I and my husband have taken our family on many trips to many parts of the world.  We make a point of staying in homes in non-tourist areas, and trying to exist as typical people live.  (public transporation, primitive facilities, etc.)
I have travelled on surch related mission trips to Haiti and Cuba, which have given me insight into extreme poverty, and different forms of government.
Through my life experiences, I have come to understand that we need more, not less, commuication and sharing.  With this in mind, a friend and I started a branch of Indivisible - Indivisible Platt Park.    The goal of this organization was to bring together people of all political persuasions for discussion and insight.  Unfortunately, the membership was primarily progressive, and we felt that there was not enough diversity to meet our goals for the organization.
Very recently, as I drive in many parts of the Metropolitan Denver Area, and even to some rural areas, I see people from all walks of life.  I am struck by their commonality, even in very different economic situations.  My young adult children are constantly pointing out unintentional prejudices I exhibit, and I consitantly work to understand and modify those prejudices.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I probably first heard of gerrymandering 5-10 years ago.  I thought, &quot;That&#39;s not right,&quot; but didn&#39;t know what could be done about it.  The commision is the perfect solution. Districts should be drawn based upon demographics, population, and geography.  I believe that I am a fair minded person, and have the time and experience required to do a good job on the commission.  I truly want our state and country to be a better place for our children and grandchildren.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
For the past 23 years, I have spent many hours promoting consensus and creating agreement within my own family.  Trying to plan daily schedules, trips, holidays, and even college graduation with the input of six individuals has given me a lot of patience, and strength to find a clear path forward, which can be accepted by all.  (Not always agreed  upon, but accepted.)  Working as a teacher, and before that working with customers, I learned that honesty is vital, and that fair does not always mean equal.  Transparency always leads to more understanding, and often dissipates anger.  Most importantly, every voice needs to be represented.
