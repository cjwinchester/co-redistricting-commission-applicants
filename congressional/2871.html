        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Miles Lauchli</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Miles Lauchli
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Customer Experience Specialist, Occipital Inc.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Bachelor&#39;s of Arts in Honors English - University of Denver
Bachelor&#39;s of Arts in Spanish - University of Denver
Certificate in Web Development - Front Range Community College
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80501
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have voted in every election since I turned 18. I have recently donated money to Bernie Sanders&#39;s primary campaign in February 2020 and Isaac McCorkle&#39;s campaign against Ken Buck in October 2020.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have not been a part of any such organizations. In college I participated in several protests, as well as organized my own, but that was back in 2009.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have recently been working to further the Black Lives Matter movement through donation and activism. I have peacefully protested and set up small community outreach projects to bring awareness to the voices of BIPOC.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am at a point in my life where I want to start working to make a larger difference in my community. I was thrilled to see congressional redistricting changes on the ballot in 2018 but I never thought I would be someone who could sit on the Commission. However, as younger Congresspeople are entering the House and Senate, and watching Mayor Buttigieg as a real contender during the Democratic primary, I realized there is no reason to strive to make a larger difference, politically speaking. As a millennial, I feel as though my voice is underrepresented in government. I want to change that.

I believe partisan politics has gerrymandered Coloradoâ€™s districts into a map that serves not constituents but politicians. With the introduction of this Commission, we have a chance to right this injustice. I am tired of feeling helpless and want a more active role in shaping my community.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Since 2016, I have done much to reach out to and understand &quot;the other side&quot;. In the last four years, the political temperature of the country has risen alarmingly, and often we stay comfortably in our own echo chambers.I regularly subscribe to political analysis from left, right, and center, and I feel I have a great handle on the matters of importance for all. I am a patient person who listens, but I am not a passive person who will compromise his values. I understand the implications of my own privilege and the mandate I have to use that privilege to care for the disenfranchised. As a teacher and customer support representative, I have developed a great skill of taking complicated ideas and distilling them into their simplistic essence, and I intend to use this skill on the Commission. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am not so arrogant as to believe that I know better than others, and if someone presents a compelling, evidence-based argument, I am willing and happy to change my opinion. However, I also believe that I come from a well-reasoned foundation that I am willing to argue for. 

I believe consensus comes first from mutual understanding and respect. If we are unwilling to listen to our opponents and only dismiss them as incompetent, we further the political polarization. This Commission is about compromise and doing what is best for Coloradans, and I believe my patience, rationality, education, and humility will be useful in helping to navigate the hot-headed emotional landscape that divides the left from the right and come to a place of agreement.
