</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>

  Business Consulting- Self Employed
</p>

</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81301
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
In all of the civic and community activities that I have become involved in I have acted as the primary leader, Area Director, or President of that organization. In each case I have grown membership or raised significant money for the cause that I was representing. As the Area Director for SW Football, the organization almost doubled in membership under my leadership. As the event director of the bicycle tour we were able to raise more that $50,000 strictly for scholarships for student athletes. This included but was not limited to: marketing and promotion, sponsorships commitments, licenses and permits, gathering participants and overall event oversight. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not ever run for an elective office, and have on one occasion provided monetary support for a political candidate. My contribution was during the last election for the democratic challenger against Representative Scott Tipton. I have manned a phone bank for candidates in the past, and I feel strongly about voting in every election and have encouraged my friends and family to exercise their right to register and vote. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am a very active member in my community. My past community involvement has included the following. Rotary International, Past President and Board Member, Colorado Football Officials and South West Colorado Football Association. 3 Year Area Director and State Association Board Member. Event director and organizer for the Durango Fall Blaze bicycle tour to benefit the Fort Lewis College Cycling Scholarship Fund. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that I possess the skill set to be a very active and productive member of this committee. As a native to Colorado I am passionate in making sure that the people in Colorado are represented equally. I want to make a difference in my state and feel that this provides me with that opportunity. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Having a background in health care administration in a large hospital system I have acquired the skills over my career to find common ground between staff, administration, and physicians. Concepts were addressed in a fair and balanced approach with all of the information provided equally among participants so that a collaborative decision would be made. As a large cycling event director all of our board members had to come to consensus so that we could provide the best event possible and still maximize the amount of money that would be provided to the student athletes. Promoting consensus is achieved by relating all of the identifying the issue, gathering appropriate information, designing the information in a format that can be understood by participants and establishing the ground rules and desired outcomes so that there is no ambiguity as to what the  task of the group should be. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As an accountant, then as a hospital administrator, and now as a business consultant I have to use analytics to provide solutions to the work projects that I have encountered in my career. Using analytics and personal work experience to determine best practices is the best way to provide solutions to problems so that the organization can achieve that highest and best outcome. Logic can be used once all of the relevant data has been reviewed and organized. Once the data is in an understandable format the reasoning in most cases is self evident. If there are still concerns or questions additional information should be provided or presented in a fashion that is understandable to the participating audience.
