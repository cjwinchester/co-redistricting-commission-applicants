<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I have had experience in organizing, representing, and considering the interest of several groups and organizations throughout Colorado. As a member of the Upper Rio Grande Economic Development, I represent my current employer, First Southwest Bank. I provide guidance on what we are seeing in the financial industry and provide the bank with updates on areas I believe the bank can assist in helping the community. As a member of the Adams State Alumni Board of Directors, I assist with organizing homecoming and other alumni related activities. In Colorado Farm Bureau, I advocate for farmers and ranchers across Colorado, but specifically in the San Luis Valley, where I am from. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have really not been officially involved in political activity. I have watched very intently all campaigns and debates as I find politics very fascinating. I have voted in every election since I was registered to vote at the age of 18. 
</p>

<p>
Upper Rio Grande Economic Development 
Adams State University Alumni Board of Directors
Alamosa High School Business Advisory Committee

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to make a difference in Colorado. Colorado is my home and I believe to be the greatest state in the Union. I want to help make sure that every Coloradan&#39;s voice is represented in Congress fairly and equally. I want to be able to learn the process of determining the districts and believe this will provide me value experience to do that. It will also provide me valuable experience in serving my State and my Country. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
One of my strongest abilities is being able to work with others, listen to their opinions, and come to a mutual agreement. I have done that throughout my entire professional career. I believe that if appointed to this committee, I will work with the other members, putting politics and political parties assigned. I will consider all opinions, facts, and figures to determine what the best redistricting will be. I will work with the other commissioners, listen to their thoughts and work together to determine the best course of action.

I have the strong ability to be fair and impartial. I will take into consideration viewpoints from all sides. I will listen and try to understand what is important to the people of Colorado all across the state. I will not let politics or political parties determine how to redistrict. I will give my thoughts and opinions based off of all the facts and figures, not based off of one certain party.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I will do what I think I do best, listen to others and find a way to meet on common grounds. Everyone comes from different backgrounds and have different viewpoints. All are extremely important. If selected for this commission, I would listen to all the other commissioners and all the public opinions. I would use facts and figures when a problem arise to assist in resolving it. I would listen to the opinions of all sides, provide my opinion, and work strongly to meet on common ground to keep things moving forward.
