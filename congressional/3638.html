</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
● I am Caucasian. I was fortunate to be married for 35 years to a Hispanic man. He brought to our marriage diverse thinking and embracing other ethnic groups. My grown son looks very much like his father. During his high school years, he faced moments of prejudice. We all faced a high school that was largely upper middle class white students, and were able to build bridges at the administrative level through open dialogue.
● I would be honored to work towards more positive discussions at the local and state level, reaching across party lines to develop consensus to create a fair map. It is critical this be done across our land. 

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
 I have been a public educator for 35 years. Twelve of the last years of my career were spent teaching in a Title One school. I learned how to work with parents of minority students. One of the powerful experiences I learned was these parents wanted nothing but the best for their child. Sometimes that was not overtly apparent because the parents were so busy trying to put food on the table and keep a roof over their family’s head. Understanding that motivated me to do what I could at school to educate their children.

● For two years, I worked at my district’s central office as a math coach. One of the controversial topics at the time was unpleasant conversations between a 5th grade elementary teacher and a middle school math teacher about the topic of students learning their math facts. (That may not sound important to some, but for 2 passionate educators, it was huge.) Ugly words were exchanged in several district wide committee meetings, and the Assistant Superintendent charged me with bringing the sides together. I used a discussion protocol that gave each person the opportunity to speak, ending with problem solving. Part of the protocol involved listening for understanding. As facilitator, I summarized both the teacher&#39;s viewpoint, and fortunately, we were able to move to problem solving. 
I believe my experiences of diving deeply into the Hispanic culture in my marriage, my work with students of color, and my “seek to understand” philosophy would be an asset to the commission.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
The last 10 years of my teaching career emphasized data-driven instruction. Working alongside 2 teammates, we would analyze test results, form groupings, and plan instruction to meet the students’ needs. Analyzing and understanding data, as well as appropriate methodology was at the forefront of every planning discussion. This collective work would not have been possible with a high level of collaboration and teamwork.
