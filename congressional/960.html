<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have never had a party affiliation or campaigned/fund-raised on behalf of any candidate or ballot issue.  I believe I have voted in every election for which I was eligible.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
International Association of Chemical Thermodynamics, Secretary (https://www.iactweb.org/board)

Symposium on Thermophysical Properties, Lead Organizer (https://thermosymposium.org/contacts.html)

Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data, Editorial Board (https://aip.scitation.org/jpr/info/board)

University College London, Department of Chemical Engineering, Industrial Advisory Board, Member (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/chemical-engineering/engagement/enterprise/industrial-advisory-board-iab)
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
The Symposium on Thermophysical Properties is a triennial scientific conference that has been held on the campus of the University of Colorado Boulder since 1991.  It is the preeminent conference in its domain, gathering between 500 and 600 scientists from around the globe each time (approximately 2/3 of participants are from Europe or Asia).  Within this community, Colorado has become synonymous with this event.

This venue has served as an excellent opportunity to showcase Colorado.  From a strictly technical perspective, we highlight local scientists both through the many colleagues who volunteer their time to organize sessions as well as our choices of plenary speakers, such as Bill Tumas, Associate Laboratory Director of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  We usually have participants from NIST, NREL, the Colorado School of Mines, Colorado State University, and across the University of Colorado system.  We also highlight Colorado companies in our welcome bags, with past inclusions such as Chocolove and PopSockets, and at our receptions, making available offerings from Left Hand, New Belgium and Oskar Blues, amongst others.

While the primary goal of this conference is scientific in nature, being able to pursue that mission in the shadow of the Flatirons is a gift that our many international visitors treasure and brag to friends about when they return home.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
My parents imparted in me a strong belief in civic engagement and service to the community.  As examples: my mother has been heavily involved with Girl Scouting and the village Women&#39;s Club for my entire life; my father served on the village zoning board and as mayor of my home town, both positions without political affiliation.  

Historically, I have targeted that drive more globally, believing that applying my talents to scientific endeavors would be the best way to have the most impact on our world.  I&#39;m excited by the opportunity to have such a direct impact on Colorado, where my engineering talent can be brought to bear on technical challenges that will have real world implications for getting the best representation for the diverse voices of Colorado.  How to effectively and fairly draw lines that give minority populations a strong voice and that create competitive districts that encourage representatives to be responsive to their constituents is both a challenging intellectual exercise and a fantastic way help Colorado get the representation it deserves.

For clarity, by &quot;diverse&quot; and &quot;minority&quot;, I do not simply refer to demographic variations in race or religious creed.  Diversity is a rich and complex thing, and while there are statutory obligations around recognized groups that must be addressed in the process, we must strive also to balance urban and rural voices, socioeconomic classes and other regional interests.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have substantial experience, both as a leader and as a member, in group efforts to develop international standards for scientific data.  In these efforts, experts with decades of experience and often differing and strongly held perspectives on subtle issues need to sit together and craft consensus documents.  This an iterative process and one that often depends on negotiation.  In situations like this, I follow the process of Principled Negotiation where points of agreement and mutual benefit are laid out explicitly early on so that everyone can keep an eye on what we are trying to accomplish.  When conflict inevitably arises, trying to use objective criteria to evaluate where a fair solution lies is essential -- in the scientific context, this is usually the literature.  

I also spent several years as middle management in a government organization.  In that role, I was put in a position where very limited resources needed to be best distributed across a number of competing interests, and my interests were among those competing.  Leading into those difficult negotiations, I explicitly prioritized my needs and developed what I believed was a compelling vision for what I and my team could accomplish with various levels of support.  When the ultimate decision did not go entirely my way (my direct reports were fine but close collaborators&#39; programs were cut), I communicated some very difficult news down the chain of command.  This outcome was disappointing and challenging, but also gave me essential experience in how to listen to direct critiques of things I hold dear while still maintaining enough detachment to form cogent analyses and counter-arguments.

Bias is implicit in how people perceive the world around them.  The judgements we make are conditioned by our personal history and psychological experiments have shown that our decision making process is for more instinctual than most would care to believe.  The best way around these challenges is self-knowledge and a strong emphasis on empirical data.  I have personally strived to hold myself to the highest standards of the scientific method.  I have learned to recognize within myself when emotion is getting the better of my rational mind and to restrain myself from making potentially imprudent comments until calmer winds prevail.  Most importantly, I listen when others speak, asking clarifying questions as necessary, so that I can understand their perspective and contrast it with my own.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I am a world renowned expert in the structuring and analysis of scientific data.  I have given invited lectures on four continents.  This skill set includes expertise in both data engineering and data science, as well as the more general critical thinking skills associated with scientific domains.

Data engineering is a discipline that combines programming, database design and data visualization in order to understand what is in a large and complex dataset and to transform it into something more amenable to analysis.  To be effective, a practitioner needs to systematically analyze data sources and write code to add structure to the information contained therein without making strong and untested assumptions.  A core idea is writing algorithms that take small bites of the big problem so that you don&#39;t have space to have made any big mistakes that could be subtle and hard to diagnose.

Data science, often labeled artificial intelligence or machine learning, is a discipline that combines statistics and computational analysis in order to identify optimal solutions to a stated problem.  I would expect this to be an essential capability to be represented on the commission, and doubly import to be present in the unaffiliated members.  It is very easy for even well intentioned people to be mislead by numerical analyses.  Our minds are conditioned to accept the kinds of explanations that mathematical models provide even when the underlying data doesn&#39;t support those conclusions.  I believe having experience with creating robust solutions to modeling problems and knowing how to critically evaluate their fitness will make me an essential voice in developing a fair set of districts.  In the jargon of data science, this is a multiclass classification, and I look forward to seeing how tools of the trade can be used to solve it to serve the best interests of Colorado.
