        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Mariela Sanabria Flores</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Mariela Sanabria Flores
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Legislative Aide for the House of Representatives 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Bachelors of Political Economy from Regis University 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80229-2893
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
Being apart of the House of Representative&#39;s has allowed me to gain more outreach skill an the ability to manage and guide diverse groups of people. My time with CLLARO I was able to advocate for the well being of the Latino community and inspiring Latin youth to volunteer with political organizations to further understand how politics effects the lives of the Latin community. With CLLARO I was able to help lead a group of over 150 people the Capital of Latino Advocacy Day to meet their State Representatives.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My only political activity has been as of recently  working with the House of Representatives for the democrats in the Colorado State House. I have not donated money to any campaign or political organizations.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
House of Representatives 
ProgressNow Colorado 
Regis University Community Outreach Program 
Colorado Latino Leadership Advocacy &amp; Research Organization 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on this commission to add to the diversity which makes up the State of Colorado. As a Latin woman I believe there are not enough opportunities to serve and get involved in matters the effect the future of the State and how it is divided on a map.  Being able to be another perspective in the room is important when decisions are being made that can change a group of peoples way of life even if it means just by the district.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I belief strongly that all the people in our state need to be represented fairly and equally. That means that every district in our state is the most logical and representation of the people of Colorado. I&#39;m a consensus builder that is strongly against gerrymandering in any form in our country or our state. I would be delighted to be part of this process to ensure the commissioners create districts that represent the ideological make up of our state. Which in my opinion means that our redistricting should reflect the fact that our state is not largely republican or democratic, but closer to a 50/50 split over the long-term. It would be an injustice to all if our redistricting would cause large disparities between the actual make up of how our state votes and the representation in the House of Representatives. First and foremost I will focus on the realization of my statement above. I will try to convince all commissioners of the need for a fair redistricting process so that all Coloradans are equally represented. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
While serving as a legislative aide I have been able to help the constituents of my Representative get the resources during the covid crisis and also in order to enact change in their communities. Being able to deduct the needs of other or their line of reasoning is used daily while in my current profession. But being able to leave everyone feeling acknowledged and helped is where logic is applied especially as I handled the cases of unemployment for constituents. In times of peril it was the best to use facts as my base to guide individuals through a complex issue such an the unemployment limbo that most of the public had gone through. It was also a guiding principle to never make false promises or prognostications about what their outcome may be. Problems of all types are best solved or a conclusion is made when facts are used to ensure that options are available to the public. If a enough solutions are provided the best one for any given circumstance is reviled through civil debate.
