<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I supported the creation of the non-partisan commissions to draw district boundaries for the U.S. House and General Assembly.   I believe that it is time for the People to have a stronger voice in how boundaries are created, because for too long a small, insular group has been taking the lead.   I believe that a robust, transparent and overtly democratic process is exactly what we need to accomplish this task.   
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have been a consensus builder and negotiator at both work and at home, in my personal life.    I have an easy going personality, that is based on building good personal relationships among diverse groups.   Kindness, active listening skills and compassion are the building blocks for creating agreement.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a commissioner, I expect to be asked to digest not only complicated demographic and historical data, but also legal guidance as well as citizen feedback.   This will require me to use my skills as an arbiter and synthesizer.   I  will approach the work of the commission as a series of problems in need of a collaborative solution.  Compromise, thoughtfulness and empathy will guide my approach because any reasonable solutions will require broad buy in.   Further, the application of logic and reason in this context strikes me as an exercise of independence.   Unburdened by overtly partisan considerations, what will become logical and reasonable is what is best for the state and people of Colorado.   What an exciting opportunity to serve.
