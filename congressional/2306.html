        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Adrienne Louise Graham</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Adrienne Louise Graham
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Adrienne Louise Vail</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I currently own a small business with my husband.  Our business provides mechanical insulation for industrial-sized projects, including power plants.  My job duties include scheduling job walk-throughs, all aspects of bookkeeping and payroll, and other miscellaneous office tasks.  Prior to becoming involved with the family business, I was employed as a paralegal with a small law firm in Pueblo, Colorado.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  In May of 2020, I graduated from Colorado State University-Pueblo with a Bachelor of Science degree in Sociology.  I graduated Summa Cum Laude, having a GPA of 3.97.  In 2003, I graduated from Pikes Peak Community College with an Associate of Applied Science degree in Legal Studies.  In addition to my two college degrees, I have attained certifications as a Certified Nursing Assistant, principles of accounting, and I am a Notary Public for the State of Colorado.  Please see my resume for more information.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81007
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
My role as a member of the Swallows Charter Academy Board of Directors included representing all of the school stakeholders during decision making.  It was important to seek out public opinion of students, parents, staff, and community members.  An example of a controversial decision involved deciding whether or not to change to a four-day school week.  It was my duty to consider how this decision would positively and adversely affect our stakeholders.  When we are representing a community, it is important that we not allow our personal opinions to influence our decision-making. We must gather facts, data, and stakeholder opinions. 
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In 2016, I assisted the &quot;3 for $3 campaign&quot; in Pueblo West.  This was a grassroots campaign that was attempting to get a ballot initiative passed under the Pueblo West Metropolitan District to raise property taxes by no more than $3 per month to fund three new parks in Pueblo West for our area youth.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
2016-2020:  Swallows Charter Academy Board of Directors
2016:  Volunteer for the 3 for $3 campaign in Pueblo West
2018: Volunteer as an outreach coordinator for JDRF for families of kids diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes.
I have also volunteered as a youth coach for soccer and baseball.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
This commission is a bipartisan group of citizens who are tasked with working together to ensure district lines are redrawn in a fair and equitable manner.  Appointees must adhere to federal and state laws as well as court decisions that address racial and ethnic fairness.  This commission is an imperative part of our electorate process.  It seeks to prevent gerrymandering and illegal voter suppression.  As a proud citizen of the United States and resident of Colorado, it would be an honor to serve on this commission. I am fortunate enough to have the flexibility in my home and work life to commit my time to the commission.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My previous work and volunteer experience has prepared me for a position such as this.  All political matters involve a great deal of controversy.  If I am appointed to this commission, I will not lead with emotion.  I will not take opinions personally.  Emotional control is of utmost importance when faced with conflict or disagreement. I will validate the concerns of all commissioners and work together to promote unity and fairness with each and every decision we make.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Research and analysis are my two greatest professional strengths.  As a paralegal, I had to gather all facts regarding a case. I had to research statutes and case law to determine whether or not our client could succeed in court.  Attention to detail was crucial.  Laws and procedures change constantly, so I could never assume I knew the answer already.  There was little room for error.  Likewise, my role as President of the SCA Board of Directors required me to research the Colorado Charter Schools Act, CDE guidelines and mandates, adhere to the Colorado Open Records Act while maintaining confidentiality when necessary, and offer tact and diplomacy when tackling difficult issues.  I am more than prepared to take on this role as a commissioner.
