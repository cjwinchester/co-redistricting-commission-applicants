<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
I have worked with people from diverse political and professional backgrounds to improve funding for our local public schools, including communicating to the public regarding needs of and questions about those schools; to promote conservation of water resources in the Northern High Plains Basin; to review data related to performance of judges in the 13th Judicial District and to write and edit evaluations of those judges; to advocate for the interests of the business community and consumers related to a stable and reliable civil justice system within the state court system.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe in a fair and transparent process for drawing district boundaries and believe that boundaries should, to the greatest extent possible, reflect community boundaries and common interests that are known to the general public, not obscure or arbitrary political considerations.  I served on the Reapportionment Commission in 2001-02 and believe that commission had the potential to reach bipartisan agreement on legislative maps.  Unfortunately under the old framework, the party in the majority had little incentive to compromise, so members of both parties who wanted to reach consensus were told to toe the party line.  The new framework adopted by Colorado voters provides a welcome opportunity for consensus building rather than maximizing partisan advantage.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My first job away from our family farm was working in community journalism as a reporter, photographer, printing press operator and janitor for eight years; through that experience, I learned to be a good listener in order to use those skills and my writing ability to tell someone else&#39;s story from their own perspective.  When I served in the legislature (1999-2005), I made a habit of getting to know my colleagues in both parties because understanding what is important and special to each person was indispensable toward finding areas of commonality, especially across party lines.  During legislative committee meetings and during my service on the 2001-02 reapportionment commission, I made a point of regularly sitting with members of the opposite political party to foster informal or personal conversations that built collegiality and trust.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
In so many cases, we unnecessarily complicate simple problems that could be solved using straight-forward mathematical comparison by injecting other considerations that reflect personal or political bias.  I have dealt with these issues and worked to build consensus in: comparing and contrasting the observations of lawyers and non-lawyers in evaluating the way judges interact with parties in their courtrooms; helping a school district or non-profits structure sustainable budgets in times of economic unpredictability; balancing the needs of water users to develop conservation plans that allow farms to operate profitably while extending the life of precious water resources; helping stakeholders find common ground on public policy disputes so that they can both achieve an important objective and preserve the viability of affected businesses.
