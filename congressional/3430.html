<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been active in the Democratic Party in Weld County for several years  I volunteer on several committees.  I am a precinct chairperson for precinct 222.  I have donated to many campaigns, probably too many to remember.  But, I have donated to Barak Obama, Mark Udall, Michael Bennet, John Hickenlooper, (governor, presidential and senate), Jim Riesberg, Mary Young, HD 50,   Dave Young, Treasurer, Gbenga Ajiboye, HD48, Sally Boccella, SD23, Karen McCormick, US SD4, Ike McCorkle, US SD4,  Jerad Polis, Joe Biden, Jaime Harrison, Amy McGrath, Mark Kelly, Katie Porter,  Weld County Democratic Party, Colorado State Democratic Party.
I have volunteered for many campaigns helping usually with writing and communication.  I have also worked as a volunteer to register people to vote.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Weld County Democratic Party, Greeley Tribune Editorial Board, Weld RE5j, Accountability Committee, 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have worked on several committees in the Weld Democratic Party.  I have been on the Events Committee, helping to plan fund raising events, the Communication Committee, which I wrote a communication plan and have helped with articles for the newsletter and web page.  I have been on the Executive Committee, and the Ethics Committee.  I was appointed to the Greeley Tribune editorial committee, and was involved in picking topics for editorials and picking candidates for endorsements.  I served on the Accountability Committee in the Weld RE5J school district as a teacher member representing my school, Knowledge Quest Academy.  This committee was a state mandated community advisory board to the local school board.  I also worked on a task force to explore the viability of getting a mill levy over-ride and bond issue on the ballot.  I have also worked as an election judge and poll watcher for several elections.  Another board I served on was the UNC  Alumni Board.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am a Weld County (Greeley) native.  I have seen a lot of change to Greeley and Weld in my life.  Most good, but some not so good, in relation to the best interest of the people who live here.  Weld County, for a good deal of the time I have lived here, has been treated like a red-headed step-child.  Some of that has been our own fault, but now we have become a large metropolitan area, and in the future, we are projected to become a major metropolitan area.  That is going to take a lot of foresight, planning and leadership that can address the needs and issues of the future.  Our districts must be fairly designed so that all the people can have their views represented. 
  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
 I believe that if presented with facts, data, community input and needs assessments, commissioners can be persuaded to make good decisions.  I know it is difficult because partisan pressures may be at play in encouraging decision-making, but those must be put aside and fairness and equitable choices must be agreed to.  A good communication plan in place with rules of engagement would go a long way in setting parameters.  I have lived in Greeley most of my life.  I have worked with and for many people who sit on both sides of the isle with many different backgrounds. I have many friends from many sides of the political spectrum.  Because of my native status, I know a lot about the history of the area, so I can give some perspective on what has come before.  Therefore, I have a unique position to be able to be fair and impartial.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Few professions have more skill in analyzing and applying logic to problems and situations, often on the fly, as teachers. Entering, analyzing and interpreting student data has become a required skill in education.  I have had a lot of practice in looking at problems...specifically in education, and finding ways to address them.  I have a background in communication and journalism, also two areas that require good analytical, research and data skills.  I also have served on the UNC Alumni Board and that required good analytical skills in deciding scholarships, alumni of the year, and how to spend funds and other issues, collaborating with people from many parts of the country.
