        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Susan Glassmacher</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>

  Susan Glassmacher
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Sue Glassmacher</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Retired.  I have been doing volunteer work within my community for the last 10 years. I work heavily with my Denver Registered Neighborhood Organization, concentrating on Historic Preservation, Design Review and Zoning. Prior to that, I owned two travel agencies.  
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  SUNY Potsdam, BA Economics and Sociology   Park Business School. business &amp; travel agent training
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80205
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
$100 donation to Phil Weiser election campaign
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Curtis Park Neighbors a Denver registered neighborhood organization (CPN) member,  CPN Executive Board member, CPN Design Review Committee, Chairperson,  (review of construction within the Curtis Park Historic District), Denver Housing Authority Citizen Advisory Committee, Curtis Park. Denver Landmark Commission participated in re-writing the city&#39;s Design Guidelines.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Firstly,  I like to work in a group.  I like when a group kicks out ideas and everyone kicks the ideas around.  I like to test my ideas.  I learn quickly, like to learn from the professionals and work within the system.  I, in turn, teach others.  I lead and organize others when speaking at City Council or the Landmark Preservation commission which both have timed comments.  I use a group method of making position points to get the full message across.  As a committee head or a representative of a group, I am very conscious that I can only speak to what the group has agreed to.  I differentiate between speaking for a group and speaking for myself.   Gaining knowledge is extremely important,  knowledge of the topic, the process and the professionals.  I can then guide others and speak on an elevated level with professionals.  I only participate in areas that interested me and I believe in.  I aim to contribute to making life better for us but I realize that I am most effective on a local basis.  I am very proud of Colorado&#39;s redistricting process.  It is fair. I would like to advocate for Colorado.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe and support Colorado&#39;s process.  It is something that interests me and I have the time.  There is no personal glory or rewards to be obtained.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I think it is of primary importance to understand that this work is done for the people of Colorado.  The goal is to have citizens properly grouped so they can be effectively represented.  I have always worked in groups to make decisions.  That means listening, learning forming an opinion or a consensus.  That means I don&#39;t always get what I want.  I approach this as a civic service.  I have no agenda,  I have nothing to gain by serving on this commission.  I have often seen people get involved in a cause or issue when it only affects them personally.  I work differently.  I work on issues that interest me, not just me personally and I work for the greater good.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Although I never used my college education directly, I use it all the time.  Economics is best defined as the study of how people, businesses, governments, and societies.  Sociology  is the study of societies and how humans act in groups.  Both rely on the collection and analysis of data.  Both rely on knowledge of statistics, how to create them and how to analyze them.  I understand how you can lie with statistics and confuse with statistics.  As a successful small business owner I had to be the problem solver. In a group, I find answers from discussion.  In discussion even a bad idea can be helpful.  It gets others to react and/or participate.
