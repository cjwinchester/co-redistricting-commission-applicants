<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I believe that community and civic involvement of the average citizen is an important part of a successful democracy. Serving on the redistricting commission(s) is a clear way for me to contribute my unique skill set to Colorado while shaping the political landscape of Colorado for years to come. 

In passing Amendments Y &amp; Z in 2018, Colorado became a model for other states to upend the partisan gerrymandering process that occurs in our country every 10 years and threatens the future or our democracy. To continue that leadership role, Colorado must ensure that the makeup of these two commissions - and the work they ultimately produce - reflect the diversity and interests of our unique state and ensure that all Coloradan voices are heard. 

Before going to college, I lived in eight different states, and went to three different high schools. Growing up, we lived in extremely rural communities, suburban, communities, and urban city centers. I understand the varied interests of those populations. I am the first in my family to get a professional degree, and I was raised primarily by a single mother. I met my father, an Iranian who immigrated to the United States in the late 70’s, when I was 16, along with four half siblings, with whom I am now close. I went to college in New Orleans and law school in Chicago and worked to support myself through both. As you will see from my resume, my professional experience is similarly varied, offering me a wide perspective of organizational practices. 

My unique and varied background makes me empathetic to a wide variety of walks of life.  

The weight of the work of this commission is not lost on me. It both terrifies and excites me to think of the impact this commission will hold. Fair legislative and congressional maps are the only path forward for our democracy to last. If maps are not drawn in such a way that every  Coloradan voice is heard, we cannot accurately say we live in a democracy. I am not only ready for the challenge, but I believe that my unique skill set and perspective will play an important role. 

Finally, I am not easily swayed by setbacks; I believe that whoever is ultimately selected for this commission can and should find a way to ensure all voices are heard for years to come in Colorado, and am confident that, if selected, I will successfully push the other commissioners to think outside of the box to find fair and equitable solutions that all Coloradans can support.

<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My full time job is to push the legal industry to dismantle the structural barriers that make it one of the least diverse professions. The programs and ideas I develop do not see the light of day if I cannot get agreement from the law firms and legal departments with which I work to try something risky and new.  I do this by using data, behavioral science, and research to develop new, experimental approaches while acknowledging the current confines within which the organization(s) and industry must work. I consistently work to put myself in our clients’ shoes and understand the struggles they face and concerns they have and take that into account when developing programs and communicating why they should implement them.

In addition to getting individual organizational buy-in, I often must help legal departments and law firms - clients and service providers - see each other’s perspective and shared interest. When legal departments simply want to push their law firm providers to “fall in line” I remind them that law firms have a host of other clients they must take into account. And when law firms are hesitant to provide information or resources that their clients request, I remind them that we can only move the diversity of the legal profession if we change how we operate and work together.

As a practicing lawyer, I spent most of my time negotiating contracts and diffusing potential disputes for my clients. I was successful in my job because I was able to get at the heart of the issue at hand without becoming entrenched in positions that made less of an impact. A deep understanding of my client’s issues gave me the flexibility and room to make changes that others may have seen as concessions; I was able to understand that they did not affect my client’s biggest concerns and garner good will with the other side. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Digging into and understanding a complex problem is not only a strength of mine, but a task I enjoy. I chose to go to law school because I knew that path would give me the best tools to do so. Prior to law school, I chose a major - Political Economy - that allowed me to marry my analytical skills with a focus on economics and logic with political policy and philosophy, which have always been an interest of mine. 

While I have excelled at logic my entire life, enjoying math and puzzles as a pastime, I continue to work to grow my skills. At my job, we emphasize collaboration, creativity, and brainstorming to get to the right result. There are few programs or initiatives that we release without a full-team brainstorming session to spot potential issues and ensure we are providing the best solution to the problem at hand. While exhausting at times, we have been successful as a small organization in shaping the legal industry because of this approach, and I continue to apply this approach to all areas in my life.

And when the need came for our team to create new tools for the legal industry, I took the initiative to teach myself how to develop apps. With no prior coding skills, I have created three apps: a directory of diverse partners at our key partner law firms (www.diversepartnersdirectory.com), a flash feedback tool for firms to use to minimize unconscious bias in the feedback process (not public), and a public directory of lawyers affected by the market effects of COVID or looking to return to the profession or pivot their practice (www.oppdock.com). As you can see, I do not shy away from a technical or analytical problem.

Finally, this year, as a new pastime, I took up the game of chess. Though I am certainly not a master, it allows me to exercise the analytical side of my brain on a daily basis. I was even able to beat my husband, who was a chess champion in high school, in a recent game (though admittedly his skills were rusty!).
