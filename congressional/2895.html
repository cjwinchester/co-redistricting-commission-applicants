</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am a registered Democrat and have given to political candidates-Diane Mitsch-Bush, Amy McGrath, and a few other candidates since 2015.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I served on the Boulder County Community Action Programs Advisory Board for Boulder County from 2018-2020. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a community health nurse at Clinica Family Health, a federally qualified health center, I provided high quality, dignified care to the underserved. My experiences deepened my understanding of health disparities and the impacts they have on patients&#39; lives. 

Prior to nursing, I had a career in progressive politics and issue advocacy. I worked hard to tell the stories of and amplify the experiences of the underserved. When I was the Deputy Communications Director with America Votes Colorado, I created a strategic communications plan for the minimum wage campaign and worked with coalition partners to implement it. A highlight was working with low wage earners and helping them talk about how the minimum wage increase would positively impact their lives.  As the Outreach and Development Director for ProgressNow, I collaborated with progressive organizations throughout the state. I worked with the Latina Initiative, an organization committed to advancing Latina leadership in Colorado, to provide training to their members on how to use social media to tell stories about their lives and experiences.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am excited to serve on the Redistricting Commission to bring my diverse experiences to help ensure equitable representation for all Colorado residents. I have always been guided by a strong sense of social justice and have focused my career on advocating for the underserved. I cut my teeth as a medical assistant at Planned Parenthood. I organized statewide living wage rallies in Maine and the Women&#39;s Political Leadership Forum, a daylong event that provided women with the skills needed to run for office. At ProgressNow, Colorado, I supported diverse progressive organizations in the use social media to advocate for their issues. At Clinica Family Health, I was a nurse leader and worked with a diverse group of medical assistants, nurses and providers to provide quality care for the underserved. In my current role as a Design Strategist at Aspen Labs, I work with teams across the country become more innovative through design thinking, leadership coaching, and strategic planning. It would be an honor to sit on the Redistricting Commission. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I am passionate, collaborative, curious, and reflective and I will bring a commitment to diversity, humor, and humility if chosen to serve on the Redistricting Commission. I have experience in human centered design and see the process as a way to find creative, outside-the-box solutions to some of our greatest community challenges. 

A recent example of consensus building was work we did in a rural tribal community Montana. My colleagues at Aspen Labs and I supported local organizations in co-creating and facilitating a two-day workshop for 150 tribal and non-tribal community members to create a vision for health in their communities using human-centered design and group facilitation techniques called liberating structures. This work culminated in ‘big ideas’ to be voted on by participants to receive grant funding. We also facilitated a workshop for the American Nurses Foundation to reimagine nursing as it relates to practice, education and regulation. In both of these examples, we galvanized people from different walks of life to collaborate and creatively imagine new possibilities for the future.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I use data and logic in most of my life to inform my decision making. For example, as the Assistant Nursing Director, I collaborated with operational and clinical leaders to meet quality outcomes. In 2017, our pediatric immunization rates dropped below goal. I reviewed our immunization data and found that our flu vaccination rates were the cause. I led an interprofessional team to develop a plan for increasing flu vaccination rates during the 2018 flu season. Our campaign consisted of trainings for medical staff and increased flu vaccine information throughout our clinics. This resulted in an increase in flu vaccinations and we met our goal.
