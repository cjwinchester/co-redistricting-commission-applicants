        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Jessica Price</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Jessica Price
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently a teacher in the Cherry Creek School District.  I am a social studies teacher at Overland High School which is located in Aurora.  I have been employed in Cherry Creek Schools for 22 years.  I have worked at Cherry Creek High School, Laredo Middle School and Overland High School.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have a BA in Liberal Arts from Colorado State University.  I have a Master&#39;s in Educational Policy and Leadership from the University of Colorado at Denver.  I am currently licensed to teach social studies to grades 6-12.  As a teacher, I have also attended numerous classes and courses covering topics such as English Language Learners, Special Education Students, Equity and Diversity, Literacy and Pedagogy.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80013
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
As a government teacher, I have always been interested in politics at the state and local level.  After the Parkland shooting in Florida in February of 2018, I became heavily involved in the gun violence prevention movement.  I became the leader of the Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America group in Aurora.  Through this work, I have been involved in many local, state and federal campaigns working to elect gun sense candidates.  Although I spend many many hours volunteering for campaigns and helping organize volunteers in Moms Demand Action to volunteer, rarely do I donate money to campaigns.  As a public school teacher, I do not usually have extra funds to donate.  I think that the only campaigns I have donated money to would be Matt Maillaro for DA in JD18, Omar Montgomery for Aurora Mayor and Jason Crow for US Congress.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Local Group Leader for Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, Aurora group.  I have volunteered with Indivisible in Arapahoe County.  I am currently serving on the Aurora Police Task Force which was an appointment by Aurora City Council.  I also volunteer with Meals on Wheels and Aurora Warms the Night which is an organization in Aurora that helps to provide food and other supplies to the unhoused in our community.  I also work with the McBride Foundation and GRASP in Denver which helps our youth who are most heavily impacted by youth violence in our communities.  I am also a member of TUFIR (Teachers United for Immigrant Rights) and I have spent time volunteering at Casa de Paz in Aurora.  I also volunteer with my local HOA as the pool committee chairperson in the summers.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As you can see from the previous answer, I am a strong advocate for gun violence prevention.  I work with legislators from both sides of the aisle to understand and vote for common sense gun laws that will make Colorado safer.  I also think that working on gun violence prevention has to be about more than just laws.  We have to work with grassroots organizations at the community level to support kids before and unfortunately after they experience gun violence.  I also have an interest in helping others to get involved in advocacy which is why I lead the Aurora groups of Moms Demand Action.  Through this position I am able to help others get involved and work to end gun violence.  I am also a teacher in a school that has many students who have experienced gun violence, have experienced homelessness, are refugees from around the world and are immigrants to our country.  Because I work with these students everyday, I have a passion for all of these causes and I advocate for these students and issues on a daily basis.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I think that I bring a unique perspective to the commission as a full time teacher at what is known as the most diverse high school in the state of Colorado.  I work with students from a variety of backgrounds everyday so I am able to share multiple perspectives.  I am also a Colorado native which is rare these days!  I have lived and will continue to live in Colorado for the rest of my life.  What makes Colorado so great is the diverse backgrounds and perspectives we have.  I think that it is important that anyone on the commission understands that Colorado is full of multiple perspectives that need to be represented in our government.  I am also the mom of three biracial children who deserve to be equally represented in our government just like their peers. Although I am a Democrat, I understand that the only way for Colorado to continue to be a place people want to live is to listen to all sides and make decisions that are best for all of Colorado, not just those living in big cities like Denver and Aurora.  As the leader of Moms Demand Action, which is a non-partisan group, much of my training and leadership has been around the importance of listening to all sides of complicated issues like gun legislation.  I feel like this training, as well as being a teacher for 22 years, has helped me to be someone who is willing to listen and compromise even when it comes to the toughest issues.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I addressed much of this in the previous question.  I work with groups all the time that include people from multiple backgrounds and perspectives.  As the leader of some of these groups, a huge part of my responsibility is to create agreement among the members of the groups.  I am faced with this task everyday in the classroom as well as through my volunteer work with Moms Demand Action.  I have been trained on consensus building through the leadership courses I took while getting my Master&#39;s Degree and I have taken similar courses as a teacher.  I think that out of all of the things that I am known for as a leader and a teacher, being fair ranks near the top.  I understand that being fair isn&#39;t always easy or popular, but it is always right.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
When you are a high school teacher who is literally making quick decisions every minute of every day, this is something that better come naturally to you!  I am constantly have to weigh pros and cons to situations (usually very quickly) and having to make reasoned decisions that impact large numbers of people.  This is something that I feel like I have excelled in as a teacher and in my other leadership roles.  I am extremely analytical and I love being faced with challenging situations to solve.  This year, as a teacher in a pandemic, this skill has been put to the test more than ever.  I am having to change everything I have ever done to make this work for my students and my own three children at home.  Although this has been exhausting, I do love the challenge of solving hard problems!
