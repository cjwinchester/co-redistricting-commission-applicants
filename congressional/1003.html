<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
     In addition to advocating for hundreds of organizations in my career as a lawyer, I also have extensive experience organizing and advocating for the people of Colorado and various public interest groups.

•	Children’s Hospital Colorado.  As an officer and executive committee member, I helped guide Children’s Hospital through its move from downtown Denver to the Fitzsimmons campus in Aurora.  This work included raising $325 million, multiple zoning and construction issues, and presentations to various constituents and interest groups.
•	Family Futures.  As a founding member and Board Chair, I formed a coalition of more than 20 non-profit organizations to help children and families lift themselves out of poverty.  We obtained a $5 million federal grant, coordinated the efforts of the non-profit providers, and delivered comprehensive services.
•	Qualistar (originally known as Educare).   As a founding member, the Vice Chair and general counsel, I helped create an organization that provided quality ratings to early childcare providers and advocated for quality early childcare.  Our work led to public kindergarten for 4-year-olds in Denver, and to a State-funded childcare rating system.
•	Colorado Storm Soccer.  As a Board Member and Chair of the Fields committee, I built a 20-field soccer complex at Arapahoe and Parker Roads - the Gates Complex.  I was the Chair of the committee that had the idea, obtained the land and water rights, raised the money, and built the complex.  
•	KIPP Colorado.  KIPP is a public charter school network, serving more than 80,000 underserved children around the country, including 2,500 students in Colorado.  As a Board Member and then Board Chair of KIPP Colorado, I helped to grow and expand our school network from 4 to 6 schools, and developed plans for continued expansion.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
     I believe that drawing fair, non-partisan, non-discriminatory congressional districts is critical to maintaining public trust in in our elections and our government.  Throughout my life I have looked for ways to make positive contributions to the world, especially in the areas of law and government.  My legal background in constitutional law, my experience working with community groups, and my interest in good government have all prepared me to help with this important work.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
     I believe I will be able to promote consensus because I have substantial experience forging agreements with groups holding divergent interests.  That experience has shown me the importance of relationships and of always following a principled approach in these situations.

     Experience.  As a litigation attorney, my job was to resolve disputes.  Although I went to trial more than many litigators, I settled more than 90 percent of my cases.  Thus, I spent the vast majority of my 30-year career developing the relevant facts and then reaching agreements based on those facts.  I have been through hundreds of formal mediations and thousands of informal dispute resolution processes.  

     My service on numerous non-profit boards, often struggling through complex community problems, has further prepared me to build consensus and create agreements among groups with divergent interests.  

     I also have experience forging agreements among groups of particularly intense advocates - namely, lawyers.  I was on the management committee for Davis, Graham &amp; Stubbs in 1999 and 2000, a period during which the firm moved to LoDo and changed its compensation structure.  Managing the firm through those changes was often challenging, but the firm nonetheless thrived though that period.  Thereafter, I faced similar challenges and found consensus as the managing partner of two smaller firms.

     Relationships.  In any effort to build consensus among divergent interest groups, the key is to develop relationships with the other decision-makers.  These come, in part, through developing friendly personal connections.  More importantly, however, good relationships come from listening and showing understanding of other positions, and then being consistent, truthful, respectful and principled in all of one’s own communications.  This builds credibility with the group which is indispensable to creating agreements.  Many of my best friends were opposing counsel in litigation.  Similarly, many people have disagreed with me on community boards over the years, but those disagreements did not injure our relationships because they knew I had listened to them, understood them, and taken credible positions based on the facts.  

     Principled approach.  When individuals or groups disagree, two steps help create agreements: (1) focus on the parties’ respective interests, (2) identify broader principles on which the parties have common interests.  Often, if the parties agree on broader principles, they share interests and a consensus can emerge.  For example, when Children’s Hospital had to decide whether to move to Fitzsimmons, many doctors, medical practices and administrators resisted the change.  When we first affirmed our shared interests in providing the best health care possible to sick children, the decision to move followed fairly easily.  When setting partner compensation at a large firm, it was useful to first affirm the shared interest of enhancing the stability and security of the firm by rewarding those who developed new business.

     Of course, compromises are often necessary to reach agreements.  However, when agreements are reached based on shared principles, those compromises take on a different character.  When compromises reflect a shared principle that can and will be used to inform resolution of the next dispute, they become more rational and focused on the greater good. 

     Fair and Impartial.   For many years, I was a serious soccer coach, earning advanced FIFA licenses and coaching highly competitive teams.  In the early years, I coached my son who played on the second team of six select teams in his age group.  I became infamous for moving him to the third team because I didn’t think he was one of my best 16 players.  That is, I cut my own son.  

     In my personal and professional life, I have always been principled, sometimes to a fault.  As a lawyer who holds a profound understanding of and respect for the rule of law, I believe I have not only the ability to be fair and impartial, but also an inescapable drive to make decisions impartially based on the facts and the applicable legal standards.

     In 2010, I applied for a position on the Colorado Supreme Court.  I was selected as one of the 10 finalists.  As part of that process, I was honored to receive letters of recommendation from three people with beliefs and backgrounds different than my own (attached):  a prominent Republican 10th Circuit judge, the President of the Colorado Hispanic Bar Association, and the President of the Colorado Women’s Bar Association.  They noted my respect for diverse points of view and my ability to be fair and impartial.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
     As a general rule, lawyers must analyze facts and apply legal rules to those facts.  I have received honors and awards for my legal skills, as reflected in the attached resume.  The attached letters further discuss my analytic skills and abilities.

     The redistricting commissioners will probably need to analyze large sets of data that can be organized and interpreted in different ways.  In this regard, a large portion of my legal practice involved complex commercial cases with experts on both sides in economics, statistics and complex accounting transactions.  I have examined and cross examined many, many data experts.  In one typical case, I represented an engineering company in a suit against 7 employees who left without notice and took my client’s business unit.  I challenged the opposing economist’s damages model at trial by substituting different assumptions he had endorsed in other cases.  On the witness stand, he revised his calculation from $1 million in damages to $3.6 million in damages for my client.  I also handled multiple class actions involving securities fraud, anti-trust violations, medical billing and consumer protection.  In each of those cases, we analyzed large sets of data to support or oppose various positions.
