<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
In September of 2018 I was appointed by Governor John Hickenlooper to the Colorado State Board of Social Work Examiners. The Colorado State Board of Social Work Examiners regulates licensed social workers and clinical social workers in the State of Colorado. Board activities include the review of licensure applications, complaints, and enforcement of disciplinary actions against violators of the Mental Health Practice Act or Board Rule. The State Board of Social Work Examiners role is to protect the citizens of the state through the licensing of social workers and assessing their competence to practice in a fair and equitable manner. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that the redistricting of the state of Colorado congressional districts will be a real challenge, there are many stakeholders invested in this process. We need to listen and respect all the constituents, stakeholders and communities of interest. I feel I can be fair and objective.  As a Latino, a life-long resident of Colorado, a gerontologist and a Social Worker I have had opportunity to work in a variety of settings and work towards multidimensional collaborative change. By working in this field, I have been able to empower, advocate, motivate, connect, and encourage resilience. To challenge stereotypes and avoid fallacies. As well as fight discrimination, oppression and injustice, no matter the form. By being a member of the Colorado Independent Redistricting Commission, I feel I will get to be a voice for all who cannot advocate for themselves. Making this redistricting a better place where the district represents the communities.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My understanding of Consensus building is that it is a conflict-resolution process used mainly to settle complex, multiparty issues. Consensus decision making is a creative and dynamic way of reaching agreement between all members of a group. In place of simply voting for an item and having most of the group getting their way, a group using consensus is committed to finding solutions that everyone can actively supports, or at least can live with. This ensures that all opinions, ideas and concerns are considered. By actively soliciting all communities of interest, LISTENING and educating these communities and by being educated by these communities of interest, through this interactive process and listening closely to each other a redistricting proposal can be formulated that work for everyone. I bring no agenda to this process; I am willing to listen, make every effort to be fair, ensure that all opinions, ideas and concerns are taken into account and work hard at finding solutions that address everyone&#39;s concerns rather than ignoring or overruling others opinions.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have extensive training in both qualitative and quantitative research, my doctoral dissertation was a qualitative study on nursing home placement and the Hispanic Family. Qualitative research has a longstanding, even pioneering presence in the social and behavioral sciences. It is a significant perspective in anthropology, psychology, sociology, education, nursing, communications, counseling, and organizational studies, and it is now an important perspective in gerontology (Gubrium, 1992).
As a member of the Academic Affairs Committee of New Mexico Highlands University, we were required to review all academic programs. All the academic programs were reviewed with an opportunity to evaluate its strengths and to ask for assistance with challenges it is facing. Furthermore, the Higher Learning Commission requires that “the institution maintains a practice of regular program reviews” (HLC Criteria for Accreditation 4.A.1). The primary purpose of program review is the improvement of each program by evaluating the following areas: 
	• the mission of the program and how it relates to the mission of the institution 
• the curriculum of the program and how it relates to the program and institution mission 
• the contribution of faculty and staff to the mission of the program and the institution 
• the assessment of student learning outcomes 
	• the future direction of your program
All these areas were reviewed to assure that they were consistent with the Standards of the Higher Learning Commission, the University’s mission and the students learning outcomes.
