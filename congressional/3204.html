        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Joseph Skylar White</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Joseph Skylar White
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Skylar White</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I interpret the internet search record for political and commercial prediction. I invented a method of using Google search data to predict election outcomes, but I do not have any conflicts of interest as ascertained by the list of questions above.  It is a form of public opinion polling.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Completed Bachelors Degree in Politics from Washington and Lee University. In pursuit of masters in data science from the University of Denver. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80218
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I believe that the only two candidates that I have donated to are: Barack Obama and Joe Biden. I received my undergraduate degree in politics from Washington and Lee University in 2011. I worked on Mark Udall&#39;s US Senate campaign in 2008 and interned in his Senate Office in 2009. I also interned with the Department of Interior. After graduating from Washington and Lee, I worked for Deloitte&#39;s Federal consulting practice in Washington, DC, working for clients such as: FDA, VA, CIA, DoD, and Amtrak. I spent several more years in the business field before re-uniting with politics as an unpaid intern on Mike Johnston&#39;s campaign for governor. During that, I came up with the idea for a new data source for political prediction and public opinion polling. I started my own company and have been testing this method for the past two-years.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
STRIVE Prep - Young Professionals Board of Trustees
Mike Johnston for Governor - Unpaid Intern
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I developed a public opinion measurement tool using Google searches to predict elections and inform campaign strategy. It is a more accurate approach to political polling because while people may lie to friends, family, canvassers, or pollsters about their political intentions because of social desirability bias, nobody lies to Google because they don&#39;t fear being judged. That makes it a more honest window into peoples&#39; motivations for voting. I set out to find this data source after realizing that survey polling is inadequately ascribing cognitive processes for voting, when they are in fact emotional processes. Using this new data source, we can consider the interests of groups empirically in a way that portends with modern advances in political theory related to evolutionary psychology and behavioral psychology that surveys cannot examine.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I think that my empathy is well-suited to this task. I am able to see issues from the other-side with great clarity because of my robust knowledge in advanced political science theory. I predicted results for state and national elections this year with unmatched accuracy from public polling because I see the hows and whys of other groups&#39; thinking. Since I am able to see the other side of things, it makes me a more successful negotiator and compromiser. I approach complex-problems through a multi-disciplinary lens of: history, economics, political science, sociology, anthropology, linguistics, morals, and psychology. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that I am well-positioned to inform the rest of the commissioners on the various historical, economic, sociological, and psychological reasons why different groups in Colorado feel different politically and ideologically. I am a multi-disciplinary savant in interpreting political intent and I have studied that state of Colorado full-time for the last two-years. I care about everyone in the state and I think that my message will be heard because of that. I believe in self-determination as a normative good that needs to be respected, and I believe that compromise is achievable, even in a media-landscape of different truths. So long as you understand the motivations in the media, as I do, I can separate those temporal effects from the long-run motivations of voters. I can figure out where there is common ground better than anyone I know. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I invented an approach to public opinion polling using the internet search record instead of peoples&#39; responses to surveys. Almost everyone uses Google, and they are more likely to use it honestly, as mentioned. I proved that there is inherent sentiment in how people use the internet to research politics; confirmation bias. People use the internet to support their pre-existing notions and dispel those contrary to their beliefs; which is why we can use the internet to measure support for political choices.
