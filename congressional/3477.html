<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not donated money to a political campaign. As a member of a 501(c)(3) we do not endorse political candidates. However, I have assisted in providing election education to the community of North Aurora. This has been done through a variety of ways. I have testified at the state legislator on behalf of bills pertaining to Criminal Justice Reform, as well as organized several candidate forums where the public was invited to engage with the current candidates in Aurora, CO. Most recently I began a program at Second Chance Center called We Are Free: Fostering Reentry through Education and Engagement, where I have a team of formally incarcerated  individuals who were able push the Get Out To Vote campaign and register other formally incarcerated people to vote in the 2020 election.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Civic Engagement Lead at the Second Chance Center
Appointed Task Force Member for Aurora Police Community Task Force
Secretary for the Board of the National Network for Justice 
Former Vice President of Tau Upsilon Alpha the National Human Service Honor Society
Former President of the Human Service Education Organization (HSEO)
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Through my position at the Second Chance Center I have had the opportunity to expand my Civic Engagement efforts. As stated above I have started a new program at SCC called We Are Free: Fostering Reentry through Education and Engagement. In this program I have a a group of formally incarcerated people that are passionate about exercising their Civic Engagement rights, through voter registration and education. In the coming months we will be holding an educational workshop where this group will explore how laws are made in the legislative session and then have the chance to testify on behalf of legislation in the upcoming session. This is something that I have done myself on behalf of SCC for the pass 2 years, advocating for laws that would continue to assist our formally incarcerated people most recently SB 217 Law Enforcement Integrity Act. As well as my current appointed position on the Aurora Police Community Task force where we will submit recommendation to APD this coming February regarding the passing of SB 217. Finally I serve as Secretary for the National Network for Justice which is a national 501(c)(3) organization who focuses on connecting grassroot organizations around the country with each other to further advance, Criminal Justice reform, &quot;crimmigration&quot; (where criminal law and immigration intersect) and climate justice. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on this commission because I believe that this is an extremely important process in our states future. I have served the formally incarcerated population for over 3 years now and it is my passion to advocate for this population. Unfortunately our incarcerated people are often affected by a huge variety of current issues including, access to mental and physical health treatment, housing inequalities, access to addiction treatment, the criminal justice system and the affects of the current climate crisis to name a few. I want to make sure this population is represented and advocated for as we make these changes in Colorado. Finally as a young person I think it is extremely important to have that outlook on this commission. As seen in current elections young people are actively involved in the political process and it is important to make sure that are represented on this commission and our voices are heard. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I will promote consensus and contribute to this process because I believe on advocating on behalf of all Coloradans. I believe that something that makes our state beautiful is the variety of people who live hear and the different cultures that call this state home. With this belief I think it is important to have fair and impartial discussions around these issues to make sure we have a Colorado that services all not just a select few.   
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Analytical skills is a quality that I pride myself on. Through my various positions at the Second Chance Center I spend majority of my time solving problems based in logic. When you are serving an individuals needs as a case manager it is important to look at the whole situation and then assess the needs and see how to best serve them, this often involves taking your own emotions out of the equation and focusing on what will best serve this individual. These skills can also be shown in my current education. As a Law Student I am constantly applying logic and reason to solve different legal problems.
