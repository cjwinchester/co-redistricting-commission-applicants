<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
First, my six year involvement with the Colorado Women’s Bar Association (“CWBA”) has provided me with experience weighing the interests of varying interest groups, and considering numerous viewpoints.  The membership of the CWBA consists of professionals from all disciplines of the law, constituents from across the state, and members experiencing rural, urban, and suburban lifestyles that affect their needs. We consistently navigate those competing interests to support our members and, when it comes to policy issues, come to a position that best represents our membership.  We also work closely with our fellow diversity bar organizations, such as the Asian Pacific Bar Association, and the Colorado Hispanic Bar Organization, to effectively use our power as the largest diversity bar in the state to support smaller organizations.  My leadership roles within the CWBA have consisted of the following; co-chair of the Judicial Nominating Committee, which vets judicial candidates for skill, ethics, and fairness, and co-chair of the Public Policy Committee, which reviews legislation and ballot initiatives and lobbies on behalf of women, children, and our ally organizations.
Second, my eleven years as a state prosecutor has taught me the importance of level-headed problem solving.  I frequently balance the interests of victims,  defendants, sentencing entities, the jurisdiction in which I am practicing, and the community.  My current role at the Attorney General’s Office requires frequent travel all over the state of Colorado.  I appear in a wide array of jurisdictions, from rural to urban, and I am regularly required to locate and consider the viewpoints of special interest groups in each jurisdiction.  I appreciate how unique every part of Colorado truly is.
Finally, my role as the assigned Deputy District Attorney overseeing the Jefferson County Veteran’s Treatment Court gave me the unique perspective of considering the needs of veterans of war who were charged with crimes once they returned from service and were discharged.  We often mediated between the US Veteran’s Affairs Department, the Jefferson County Probation Department, the Jefferson County Center for Mental Health, the Jefferson County Public Defender’s Office, and the Jefferson County Judiciary to find the best solution and supervision to promote community safety but also find an avenue for rehabilitation for each veteran we encountered.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
First, I am a committed public servant and serving on this unique independent commission will be a wonderful way for me to serve the people of Colorado.  I have a profound respect for voting rights and participation in our democracy, and how and where districts are drawn can shape communities’ ability to elect the representatives of their choice.  I am a good candidate to ensure districts are made as equal in population as practicable so that communities have equal access to political representation.
Second, this is a unique opportunity for civic engagement.  I belong to my local neighborhood associations, and this has shaped my point of view about representation of each unique community.  Even the different neighborhoods in Denver have incredibly distinct characteristics.  I have also lived in neighborhoods of Chicago, and New Orleans.  While living in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, I saw the breakdown of local government as it strained under the weight of a natural disaster.  This underscored my passion for democracy starting at a micro-level, and I see an accurate district map as an essential element for representative government.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
First, if I am chosen for this commission, I will promote consensus by using my seasoned skills in calm diplomacy.  As a trial lawyer who handles matters from human trafficking, to drug trafficking, to homicide cases, I am comfortable in emotionally charged situations.  Time in my role has taught me that remaining calm in conflict allows for a better chance at moving forward and finding resolutions.  I am also adept at finding common ground.  My position often requires mediation to come to a mutually agreeable resolution of a case, despite competing interests and concerns of the various interest groups involved in every case.  I find that, more often than not, there is more in common than not with these opposing viewpoints, and I can bring that life experience to the commission.  

Second, I am pragmatic and fair.  In my role, I am charged with acting with impartiality to prioritize equal treatment of all parties in a case.  This means putting my personal interests and desires aside.  I am confident that I can utilize this fairness and impartiality in my role on the commission.  The public servants chosen for this commission will have a good starting point for finding that common ground; every applicant shares care and concern for a fair examination of where our district lines should be redrawn.  Colorado has seen profound population growth and change in the last ten years, and it would be an honor to support that growth and change by ensuring fair representation for all Coloradans – new and old – with representative and thoughtful district lines.  

Finally, I will build consensus with my fellow commission members by appealing to our goal of fairness.  It is a rare person I come across personally or professionally that I cannot get along with.  Districts that are unfairly drawn are shown to stifle voter turnout, and I am confident that I can work with my fellow commission members to ensure that every Colorado voter and district is equitably represented.  It is an honor to live in a state that prioritizes this independent review of district lines, and I am confident that my fellow commission members and I will appreciate this duty and execute it accordingly.  As mentioned, I understand the value of and need to set aside personal positions to make progress toward a goal. And while I take my work seriously, I do not take it personally, and look forward to making new connections with the other commissioners that are selected to serve the state.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As an attorney, I utilize my analytical skills on a daily basis.  A thorough and sensible review of all of the relevant facts and perspectives is a necessary starting point for addressing any problem.  Once this examination is complete, a logical plan or solution can be crafted.  I also recognize that everyone’s problem solving strategies are different.  When working on a team, I enjoy learning new problem-solving skills from my teammates.  Diplomacy, respect, and kindness are incredibly important when collaborating with a new group.  The individuals and entities with which I work in my position at the Colorado Attorney General’s Office are in constant flux with every case, and I have learned to be flexible and patient in my problem-solving approaches, while upholding the principles with which I believe will get us to the best solution for the problem at hand.
