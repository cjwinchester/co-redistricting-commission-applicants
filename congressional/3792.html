<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I’ve been a member of the Democratic party since December of 2007, when I began volunteering for then-Senator Barack Obama’s presidential campaign in Iowa. 

My experiences volunteering for the Obama campaign in the Iowa Colorado caucuses left me motivated to get even more involved, and in March of 2008 I was fortunate enough to join Jared Polis’s Congressional campaign staff as the Internet and Online Communications director. I spent the rest of 2008 working my heart out for what became a winning Congressional campaign, developing and managing a sophisticated voter data operation, integrating directly with the county clerks offices to ensure the best possible data model which with to inform our decisions.

Additionally, I was a precinct captain during the 2008 Democratic caucuses, and served as caucus chair for my precinct the night of the 2008 Democratic caucuses. Additionally, in 2010 I served as a State Convention delegate for Senator Michael Bennet&#39;s Senate campaign.

<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
The heart of our democracy beats within our legislatures, for that is where the people maintain the most real-time and granular electoral connection to their government. It is essential that these elected legislators make up the most accurate and fairest-possible representation of their constituents.

The questions of district boundaries are problems that are indisputably rich with underlying data, and as such I believe the definitions of these boundaries are tractable to rigorous quantitative analysis. Demographic, spatial, temporal, community and partisan data points can be examined and modeled with a level of accuracy and ease that was not possible in previous years. 

The people who voted for Amendments Y and Z, I believe, did so with a belief that an independent redistricting commission would use a combination of analytic data, rigorous process and common sense to produce a set of maps which fairly and accurately represent the people of Colorado at both the State and Federal level.

Although inherently a political process, I believe that a focus on objective, data-based decision making combined with a rigorous and transparent process will result in a fair, impartial and ultimately successful redistricting process. This will result in the best, fairest possible representation of the people of the State of Colorado at both the state legislative and Federal levels.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that both consensus, as well as impartiality, can best be achieved by agreeing to an objective set of measurable facts and success criteria at the outset of an endeavor. Working with every interested party to define these facts and criteria gives every involved party a common frame of reference from which to work.

Of equal importance is what I would call “radical transparency.” It is in the best interest of every party involved in redistricting to create a process that can observed and measured not only by the parties directly involved, but also (and most importantly) by the people of the State of Colorado, whom the commission represents.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I’ve spent my professional career working in fields which demand rigorous process, data-based decision making and transparency. 

My extensive experience as a software engineer has taught me that the first and most important step in solving a problem, is giving a clear and concise definition of the problem itself. I believe this to be true whether the problem is defining a voter database, or defining the criteria through which maps are drawn. 

My experiences in political campaigns and working on the State’s voter registration system, have taught me about the utmost importance of voter data. This data in many ways defines who we are as an electorate, and our legislative representation is a direct reflection of this data.

My experience in medical research has taught me about the importance of rigor-of-process. Define what you are trying to measure and the hypothesis which you are testing. Clearly and precisely define the experiments that you are going to perform to test the hypothesis, and then rigorously adhere to the experimental process which you have defined. Review your results, and then begin again.
