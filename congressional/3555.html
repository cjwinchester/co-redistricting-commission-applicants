<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In 2020 I donated $15 to the Biden/Harris campaign, but have not previously volunteered with an organization nor donated money.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
My experience is primarily with student organizations during my time at university. These would include
- University of Colorado Swing Dance Club Student Organization
- University of Colorado Model United Nation Student Organization
- University of Delaware Swing Dance Club Student Organization
- National Honor Society Member through the University of Delaware

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have experience with organizing student and growing organizations of various sizes, and advocating for these student groups with the wider university systems especially with funding and growing membership numbers. During my 2 years on the board with CU Swing Dance I was able to develop a core leadership group, and increase membership attendance from 15/week to 60/week handling an annual budget of $10K. 

I&#39;ve taken these student organization skills into the corporate environment to leverage people&#39;s passions to create a feeling of belonging and coming to a strong team decision that can move forward with a clear sense of ownership. 

While I would be new to the political organization sphere, I think that could play to the groups&#39; advantage as I would not have any strong previous political alliances beyond the success of our state and nation to be beholden to. During the course of my experiences in developing and advocating roles I have found that being able to step back and listen to all sides of concern, without the weight of preference upon me, has allowed me to respond with more compassion with a fair balance of facts to make data driven decisions to benefit all involved. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I think it&#39;s important that all voices in all of our diverse communities are heard and have the opportunity to self-advocate within a larger political system. As a Colorado native, I have seen first hand how so many of our communities have changed, and how some voices have been lost as a result.  I think during this unique time, when we need to unite our community perhaps more now than ever, we must first start by acknowledging our differences and ensuring those differences can be represented, not squashed. I would like to serve my Colorado community, my home, as we move into this next chapter. I would like to work to ensure that the commission comes to decisions that will serve all those we represent, while we might be a small this is not a small undertaken to identify and proactively prevent issues for our growing state. 

I also think that I could be a strong, well informed voice for a younger generation full of future voters. Politics for so long has been the &quot;old boys club&quot; which is no longer serving our country. We are more diverse and the decisions about our political future should have influence from those who it will impact the longest. While age may provide wisdom, it can also be wise to change how we evaluate current systems, the systems that many believe have failed those it&#39;s meant to serve. T
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
While individuals may disagree on many topics on the political spectrum we come here with a common goal: to serve our communities. I think the best way to build consensus is to first identify the shared goals for this organization before getting to detail oriented. By building a shared common language and framework of operations we can discuss the more contentious topics with respect for each other and respect for our core goals. Furthermore I am an empathetic person, we will all be coming here with our own story that shapes how we view the world and make decisions. By removing any &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality it will allow the whole commision to move forward successfully. 

Additionally I am not preemptively hoping for a specific outcome. This allows me to look at the whole picture without seeking confirmation bias, it allows me to listen to opinions openly without seeking points of pure rebuttal.  This will allow me to unitilize facts and data to come to decisions, to hear all sides and provide an unbiased and fair opinion. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Making data driven decisions is key to ensuring a sustainable outcome. During my degrees I was often working with large data sets to provide insights and I can rely on my understanding of statistics to guide my decisions. As part of my professional career I continue to use large data sets to ensure that we&#39;re making good business decisions without the detriment of the people it will impact. We often need to make decisions that have a trade off, and being able to find a way that objectively helps the most people without undue detriment to those not directly benefiting needs to be based on as much data as possible. 

Additionally, solving a problem starts with making sure we&#39;re asking the right questions. Looking at data will only serve us fully if we&#39;re asking the right type of questions. To do this we must engage in expansive thinking before we can move to deductive thinking.
