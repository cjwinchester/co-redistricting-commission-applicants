        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Michael Chad Bauman </h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Michael Chad Bauman 
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Chad Bauman</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am currently employed as the Estimating Manager for San Juan Construction  
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  B.S. in Mathematics, A.S. with emphasis on Mathematics,  A.A. in Outdoor Education 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  81401
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have no previous political involvement. I have not made any donations or contributions to any campaign or political party.  Being on this commission will be the first time I have participated in politics beyond voting every November. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
My employer, San Juan Construction, is an employee owned company. I served 4 years on the Company Communication Committee. The goal of the committee was to promote an ownership culture within the company.  
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have participated in and helped to coordinate/organize community service projects in the Montrose area through the Church I attend.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Government by the people, for the people is a revolutionary idea, but is subverted by gerrymandering. Serving on the commission provides an opportunity for me, one of more than three hundred million Americans, the ability to help government function as intended. When those in power use their position to marginalize others, it slowly destroys part of who we are as a Nation.  I hope that by serving on the commission, I can help to draw congressional districts that ensure all who live in Colorado can have an equal vote and can elect representatives who actually represent the people who live in their district. Gerrymandering is an abhorrent practice, and I am excited to be part of the solution to end it.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Every person selected to be a member of this commission will have their own political views and will have strong opinions about how the new districts should be drawn. As a member of the commission, my first goal would be to participate in some basic team building exercises. This will establish a foundation on which the members can begin to understand the root cause of each individualâ€™s perspective.  

For the commission to succeed in drawing fair districts, while accounting for 21 different peoples concerns, it is going to require tremendous patience and a commitment to understanding the concerns of the other members.  Two people can view the same event and arrive at wildly different conclusions. Too often in politics, people take a binary view that only one person can be correct. This results in further division and typically the only solution is a compromise that falls short of both parties needs.  To successfully represent all of Colorado, the commission members will need to accept, and find solutions too, issues that may not appear to be a problem to them, but are very real to others.  

I believe the lack of understanding of the realities of how other people live contributes to political gridlock and partisan politics. I do not have any magical tools that will eliminate this, but I do feel that my awareness of this issue helps me to remain fair and impartial and I am committed to bring this to the commission. I am excited to help return the power to the people of Colorado and appreciate your consideration for the commission.

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As the estimating manager of an industrial construction company, I spend most of my workday analyzing project estimates, financial budgets, insurance calculations, and construction schedules. I also must determine the reasons we were not successful on a project and make adjustments for the next bid proposal. In order to be successful, this all must be done with data driven analytics. 

I have a B.S. degree in mathematics.  Math is one large series of logic stepping-stones. You build a base at the most simple idea, then use logic and reasoning to prove something new is true.  Once that truth is established, you can use it to prove something else. Logic and inductive reasoning are a foundational part of my college education, are used on a daily basis in my career, and I try to apply it in all parts of my life. If selected to be a member of the commission, I plan to use my math background to develop and set of criteria that an algorithm can follow to draw the districts. Hopefully, this will set a standard for how future commissions approach redistricting in Colorado and the rest of the nation.
