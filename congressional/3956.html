</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My experience stems from the perspective of a single mother, a woman of color and a caregiver with over 24 years of taking care of those who have been marginalized or disenfranchised in our society, low-income minorities living with disabilities. It has given me purpose and motivation to advocate for those who continue to be &#39;unseen&#39; and &#39;unheard&#39; in their struggles for equity and access to resources that they should have every right to like food, healthcare and community. I work with organizations that have a direct impact on policies like the Colorado Developmental Disabilities Council and Rocky Mountain Farmers Union. I&#39;ve represented the voice and organized with those who care about our environment and want to stop the destructive ways in which we are destroying our planet. I&#39;ve lent my voice to bring awareness to being the &#39;most polluted zip code&#39; in America as we fight for clean air and clean water as the Colorado Basin continues to suffer from drought after drought, year after year.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am a product of the systemic inequalities that have long existed in America&#39;s history. Being a child of a military veteran from the Vietnam war and an immigrant, I have seen the sufferings of PTSD and inadequate access to medical care, food, housing, etc. My world has always been exposed to the social injustices experienced by the minorities in my community. Many of the inequalities that exist within our local, state and federal governments are due to the systemic oppression that does not lend opportunities to those that have been disenfranchised. That needs to change. People of color are not represented in these arenas and continue to be left out of major decisions that have direct impact on their livelihoods. I want to serve to show others that we CAN be included and that our voice counts just as much as anyone else. We can make a difference if we stand in solidarity towards a more EQUAL future that allows for every person to be heard and seen. Community matters! We can not do anything unless we come together to work towards a more inclusive environment.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that I will contribute to creating agreement among the commissioners by actively listening to their perspectives, taking into account of mirroring them and being creative together in finding solutions that will benefit all. Many times the problem is the solution. By allowing ourselves to be open to considerations and alternative options, I believe we can create a consensus that can work for everyone to be heard and seen. As a single mother and a caregiver, I have learned that in order to keep the peace, we must see any situation from many different angles. It can be hard to not bring in your biases, but to be fair all considerations must be taken in because you may not have seen something that may have been a crucial or pivotal consideration.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I currently sit on many committees and councils that address societal inequalities. Due to this, I believe in resolving issues through community. Two heads are better than one and there&#39;s always another way to look at a problem. But when I look at a problem, I apply logic and reason through my life experiences and my educational background. As in any problem, I address the root issue that is causing the problem, assess what options are available to me and then discuss how I will approach the problem by laying out a plan of action with several alternatives. Once a plan has been agreed upon, I will proceed to set it in motion taking into account any observations that may reveal itself and adjust or adapt accordingly.
