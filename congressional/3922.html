<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
In my teens I was past president of the Baylor Young Democrats, and I worked on my father&#39;s campaigns for City Council in Waco, Texas.  I worked on various Democrats&#39; campaigns in Colorado and Virginia as a volunteer.  I have made small donations to various campaigns, most recently campaigns for Joe Biden, John Hickenlooper, Julian Castro, Amy McGrath, and Jaime Harrison.  I also volunteered in efforts to elect School Board members in Jefferson County seven years ago to recall three right wing members.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Jefferson County Teachers Association, National Educators Association, National Counsel of Teachers of English
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have walked with other volunteers in Jeffco neighborhoods for candidates of various offices in Colorado.  During the recall of School Board members, I spoke in various meetings of volunteers and in school board meetings.  I also worked during the late 80s and early 90s with various education improvement efforts chaired by Governor Roy Romer and others.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that elimination of gerrymandering would be one of the most important steps toward a more democratic election of national candidates. I would hope that this commission would work toward that end.  My knowledge of political process and interest in improving it enables me to be a valuable contributor.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I was a teacher for 30 years and, before that, an advertising/marketing executive for 15 years.  Creating consensus among my clients, peers, parents, and others was a skill that was sought.  I also took coursework in consensus-building.  I preferred to be a member rather than a leader on committees, but it was common that my thoughts would not only be considered by also valued as I tend to look at the bigger picture and not get caught up &quot;in the weeds.&quot;
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Critical thinking is a skill that must be developed over time.  Over my work life that was a skill that was required for any level of success.  As a teacher, one must evaluate constantly in the classroom and apply observation to action, constantly.  It required more than simple evaluation of a student&#39;s work; it was seeing beyond that which was obvious.  The most important thing as a teacher is to keep your eyes on the most important thing:  students and learning.  Everyday my &quot;mantra&quot; was, &quot;If what I&#39;m doing right now is not about students and learning, then I must be doing the wrong thing.&quot; As a teacher I became a reflective practitioner.  I made a discovery that I passed on to my peers and others through my classroom research that I would like to share.  It started early in my career when a 9th grade student in frustration threw her pencil to the floor and exclaimed, &quot;I used to be able to spell.&quot;  Indeed, she was a terrible speller. But I asked her when she could spell and when she couldn&#39;t.  She said that she could spell in the 6th  grade, but she could not spell in the 7th grade anymore.  So, I asked what happened between the 6th and 7th grade, and she responded, with a slap to her forehead, &quot;Oh, I was in a car accident and hit my head.&quot;  It was then that I started asking questions of my students struggling with reading and writing about their academic histories.  Invariably, there was some sort of head or hearing trauma that intervened in these students&#39; learning.  This was well before the attention on brain injuries in athletics.  My Masters in Education prepared me to learn how to conduct research in a classroom setting.  Bottom line, I discovered that by the time a student has reached his senior year, in a &quot;non-advanced&quot; English class at least 50% of students have had a head injury, and more boys than girls had experienced such an injury.  I found that most boys who don&#39;t like to read have had an mTBI (Mild Traumatic Brain Injury).  Most students who have been diagnosed with ADD or ADHD have had an mTBI.  I don&#39;t mean to exclude girls; it&#39;s just that fewer have had an mTBI.  I learned to look for ways to accommodate these conditions and that labels may be given to students who have difficulty reading or writing that are undeserved simply because a teacher has not asked, &quot;What happened?&quot;  I have shared these realizations with others and met with district health personnel, and they get it.  I also consulted with the Colorado Brain Injury Alliance who were also helpful in provided guidance and instruction.

As an advertising/marketing executive I had to analyze a market&#39;s tendencies and use marketing research and focus groups to develop effective campaigns.  My clients over the years included American Airlines, Hertz Rent-a-Car, Coors, and many others.  A truth that was important to realize is that nothing will kill a bad product faster than good advertising.  Another truth is that listening is much more important that talking.  As a result, back in the early 80s I realized that was much more fit for teaching than for advertising.  I realized what I was good at doing when I found myself teaching writing to the copywriters and critical thinking to my peers and supervisors.  I also realized a truth about me:  I valued ethical behavior and results.  A famous ad exec once told me to never let the truth get between me and good advertising.  I can never thank him enough for helping me realize something that was central to my being:  the truth.
