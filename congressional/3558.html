<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am sure it is less than $200 in total over this time period as I don&#39;t usually donate.  Unfortunately, I can only recall donating $50 to Amy McGrath and $50 to the Hickenlooper campaigns in 2020 at this moment.
</p>

Chair (current), Health Care Cost Analysis Task Force (HB19-1176).
Director (current), Community Radio of Northern Colorado (KUNC).

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have worked at Sunrise Community Health for 22 years. During that time, I have advocated for the under- and uninsured residents of Colorado, particularly in northern Colorado.  To ensure affordable health care for all, I have learned to collaborate with people of all backgrounds, professions, and political wills to create an awareness of who Sunrise serves, what their needs are, and what challenges they face.  As a result of this, Sunrise serves over 42,000 people in northern Colorado in an efficient and sustainable manner.  Our unique collaborations lead to cost-effective and inclusive programming not found elsewhere in the State.  

To create such a system, in a very conservative area of Colorado, I have learned to look beyond political parties and find where the Venn diagram overlaps between where the red, blue, and purple ideologies live - and it is there more than the current social and political environment would imply.   
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am a 4th generation from Yuma, CO. I have lived in Greeley since 1984. I have been a registered Independent and active voter since age 18. I am engaged in the political process and believe strongly in the democratic process. 

Gerrymandering is one of the top threats to our democracy and I wish to see the effects mitigated by fair and reasonable redistricting.  Districts that have a cross-section of voters and political ideologies will lead to compromise - a good place to govern from. 

Sadly, I just learned of this opportunity today. Therefore, I cannot submit letters of recommendation by the deadline. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
When working with groups of people, I seek consensus versus a straight up majority rules. How? By inclusion, listening, exploring concepts, and seeking win-wins. By providing a safe space where all can express thoughts and ask questions.  I am proud at Sunrise that we have the spectrum of beliefs represented in our clinical team of 70 physicians, APPs, dentists, hygienists, and pharmacists.  We have a Catholic Deacon on the team as well as a provider who believes we should hand out condoms at the front desk. They respect one another, they work together and the system supports both of them. But most importantly, the system supports patients - no one&#39;s ideology is forced upon a patient. 

I receive consistent positive feedback about my ability to be fair, objective, and impartial - and inclusive. It takes creativity and a willingness to lean-in hard, listening without judgment.  It takes sifting through the static to identify the heart of the matter, to logically assess the situation, and make decisions from there. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I receive consistent positive feedback in this area as well. Working with clinicians, you must learn to use data and analytics to inform decision making. I am skilled at hearing the full scope of a challenge and honing in on the core components, applying logic and reason to the problem.  In addition, I am particularly skilled at communications - making complex concepts and ideas accessible to all.
