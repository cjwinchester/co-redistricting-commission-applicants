</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Lisa Neal</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Since 12/20, I have worked as a full time candidate for Douglas County Commissioner, District 2. Although I didn&#39;t prevail, as a first time candidate during a presidential election year in an extremely Republican county, I was able to garner two historic accomplishments, first, I received an endorsement from a current elected official willing to cross party lines, and nearly 90K votes in a county of 44K active voting party members along with nearly 15K undervotes in my favor.  Prior to running for office, I serve as the Chief Innovation Officer for Colorado State Attorney General.  Please see my attached resume for greater insight into my work experience.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I have an undergraduate degree in Applied Math and Computer Science from Hampton University with high honors, a master of science degree in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language from Michigan State University, a master of engineering degree in Engineering Management from University of Colorado School of Engineering (Boulder), and a Juris Doctorate with a telecommunications and technology policy emphasis from University of Colorado School of Law (Boulder).

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I recently was a candidate for Douglas County Commissioner - District 2, where I garnered support from Democrat, Unaffiliated, and Republican endorsements and support.  As a first time candidate, running as a Democrat, and a Republican-run county, I ran in an effort to create more diversity in our county. While I didn’t prevail, I moved the dial and began to process of creating a community that crosses party lines.  Before this experience, I worked on AG Weiser’s campaign in the 2018 election. As Phil’s Community Outreach Director and cabinet member, I was responsible for delivering the vote from communities of color in Colorado.  With significant engagement within the communities, we were able to increase voter turnout by slightly higher than 7%--more than any prior mid-term election, resulting in a win by 6%.  I have contributed to the following campaigns and organizations:
Amy Padden for District Attorney
Arapahoe County Democratic Party
Coloradans for Katie Barrett
Colorado Democratic Party
Committee to Elect Kyra for HD44
Douglas County Democratic Party
Duran for Colorado Leadership Fund
Elect Lisa Neal-Graves
Friends to Elect Darien Wilson
Friends to Elect Ilana Spiegel
Heidi McCollum for District Attorney
Ian Chapman for CO HD 39
Janet Buckner for Colorado
Matthew Maillaro for DA
Ortiz for Colorado
Paula for Colorado
Phil Weiser for Colorado
Rhonda Fields for Colorado

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a career tech exec, I spent much of my volunteer time encouraging and mentoring youth of color to pursue education and career opportunities in STEM. As the first woman to serve as president of the Colorado Association of Black Professional Engineers and Scientists, and mentored other leaders after. At a time with COVID is impacting small businesses, I provide pro bono legal and business counsel to small business owners who otherwise are unable to afford services with a particular focus on minority and women-owned businesses.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the commission to be a part of the effort that allows our state to draw congressional lines to ensure that all of our  residents have their voices represented within their districts.  Specifically, I think it is very important that communities of color, as well as rural communities, can have a seat at the table where issues specific to their communities are part of the policy discussion. This is important work that is not partisan but focused on ensuring the values of all of our state residents are considered in how we are governed. I want to work to create congressional districts that support more just and equitable congressional districting that also reflects how we are governed across the state.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my last corporate effort, I ran a line of business that had evolved through a series of acquisitions.  As a result of these acquisitions the teams were combined but not developed so there were no true norms and the efforts were based on how large the customer base each of the teams were responsible for, which meant smaller acquisitions felt as though they had no power and the best talent from these teams rarely stayed with the organization.  When I was hired, I had to build the team that would support the full business.  This required me to learn all of the solutions, identify all of the competencies needed, and learn the strengths and developmental areas of each of the team members.
Since this work couldn’t be done in a vacuum, I had to find team leaders that could work across the whole and not focus on saving their own members. Before starting this work, I did a team building exercise where I asked each team member to tell me the concerns they had with the team as a whole. We ananomatized this information and used it to share with the leadership team as a whole how the organization was feeling as a whole and asked them to help me figure out the best way to restructure the organization demonstrating grace and operating with empathy. I implemented co-partners for each function that had to learn from each other and jointly determine the team competencies and structure. We development team values and operating normals and published them--we reiterated them at the beginning of all of our operational reviews.  We forced discussions to be rooted in data and facts - but allowed the use of anecdotes to zero in on a particularly difficult issue.
What I believed helped the team function fairly was that requirement that we had to had pros and cons to the particularly difficult issues and intentional/disciplined decision making to solve problems. While it wasn’t perfect, it allowed us to work through the difficulties of building a real team quickly and allowed us to support our customers in a way that nearly doubled our Net Promoter Score.
The combination of my engineering and legal analytical skills enable me to think differently than most and to solve complex problems that anticipate many unintended consequences and build better solutions.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have had a successful corporate career within key Fortune 50, mid-growth, startup, and nonprofit organizations. My background spans the tech industry, legal field, and government service from Colorado to New Jersey to Oregon to China and back to Colorado. I have a proven track record as a complex problem solver focused on strategy, change management, and long-term planning. I am a collaborative team leader, trusted advisor, and a skilled negotiator.
As an engineer, I am avid user of data-driven methodologies, I have honed my creative analytical, critical thinking, and research skills to support disciplined-decision making and build strategies and plans for my business and volunteer efforts. Notwithstanding my analytical focus, I have always led with empathy to ensure that members of my teams are treated with dignity and respect and feel heard and valued. I find when team members feel valued they contribute their best work and are loyal to the team as a whole. I believe this will be beneficial for what I anticipate will be long and arduous work.
