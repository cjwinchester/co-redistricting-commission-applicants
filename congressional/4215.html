</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
As a retired Social Studies teacher, I recognize the importance of the efficacy of our electoral system on the maintenance of our democracy. In the last half century. As a country, over the last 50 years, we have become more and more polarized and less able to compromise, particularly in the U.S. House of Representatives. It is my belief that this is largely because of redistricting by both major political parties, who have worked to engineer &quot;safe&quot; districts for their own political gain. I believe that allowing for competitive districts leads to a better, more bipartisan candidate slate, because candidates are forced to appeal to a wider variety of political views. Safe districts lead to more extremist candidates who are beholden to their constituents to refuse to compromise their positions. For our democracy to flourish, we need the best candidates and candidates that are willing to compromise and act in a bipartisan manner when it is in the best interests of the people. I want to serve on this commission to help draw districts that will allow for this.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I will promote consensus by discussing the great benefits to all parties, but especially voters, regardless of their party affiliation, of designing competitive districts, as I&#39;ve outlined in the previous question. I will also promote consensus by listening carefully to my fellow commissioners, carefully considering their points, and looking for ways that they intersect with my point of view and the points of view of others on the commission. I will encourage debate, mutual respect, and careful consideration of all commissioners points of view by setting the example as well.
My ability to be fair and impartial is best illustrated by my 20 years of teaching Social Studies in Colorado&#39;s public schools. For 15 of those years, I taught American Government, where it was necessary for me to impartially evaluate student discussions, assignments and research papers. Never revealing my own political proclivities, and listening carefully to other points of view was a crucial part of this effort. In 20 years of teaching, I never had one parent complaint or question about my ability to present the workings of our government in a fair and balanced way.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My analytical skills were first developed in my adult life as a computer programmer and computer analyst. My first career in the computer business required me to research and investigate business problems that could be potentially solved by computer systems. Understanding a broad range of end-user needs and using those needs to design the nuts and bolts of a software system, and then adjust that system as needs changed, was a challenging role at which I ultimately excelled. 

My second career, as a public school teacher, also required analytic skills. Carefully evaluating student work and designing individualized learning plans for students based on their prior knowledge, strengths, weaknesses, and motivations requires a great deal of synthesizing and interpreting not only data, but human hopes, dreams, fears, and anxieties. Thus, my teaching career built upon the skills developed during my career in the computer business, but in very different ways.
