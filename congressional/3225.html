<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I am passionate about actively addressing issues around me and having a positive impact whenever I can.  As the mother of a young son in DPS I have become involved in helping organize at his school. I have helped raise money to sponsor important teacher projects and host events that encourage family engagement and childhood literacy. This involves a lot of elements of organizing as it is important to work with different members of the school community to ensure our work is inclusive and representative.  Additionally we played a large role in advocating for our teachers&#39; and students&#39; rights preceding and during the teacher strike of 2019.  Outside of my work in the home and in my son&#39;s school, I work full time as a manager for The Body Shop.  My company provides employees with 3 paid volunteer/activists days each year.  Having worked for the company for 7 years now, I have greatly enjoyed this employee benefit.  I stood out  amongst my peers as a manager who always used my personal activist hours and always ensured my employees each did as well. I began to act as a local leader in this area.  I helped my peers across the Colorado market learn about their employees&#39; passions and interests and connect them with local nonorganizations and grassroot groups who have similar focuses.  Through this I have become familiar with many local Colorado groups and have coordinated many volunteer opportunities for myself and others.  I now act as the North American Chair for our internal activism network where I am working with key members of the brand to create resources and tools to encourage our teams to become more active in their local communities. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I would like to serve on the board to ensure that the way the districts are redistributed is fair and allows for the diverse voices and choices of Coloradans to heard and represented. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I listen respectfully to others in a way that assumes positive intent, and look for value and points of agreement.  I also am comfortable in speaking to points of contention with empirical evidence. While I am confident in sharing my opinions when a situation calls for it, I also understand that it is not always my voice that needs to be heard.  I practice deferring to folks from minority or marginalized groups when making decisions that impact the community at large.  I am known in my community roles for having the ability to rally others around a common cause and provide clear, data based strategies and feedback. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
While studying political science I became very drawn to the science part of my studies.  While political and social phenomenons are often polarized and the subject of heated political debates, they are beyond that, real situations that are occurring in our community.  When we seek to examine the condition of different phenomenons using data and empirical research we are able to better understand more about different situations and how to best address them. This was a very effective way to cut through the noise that often surrounds issues that are often politicized and has allowed advocate for solutions based not on poltical belief but in what solutions best addressed different issues. Though my current work as a retail manager does not require addressing solution for community issues, it does require maintaining harmony amongst a group of people as we pursue a common goal. I find myself often using this same data based approach to navigate issues with employees and when both, giving and recieving feedback.
