   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>

</p>

</p>

</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Worked as Personal Assistant / Family Liaison for U.S. Ambassador Beatrice Welters in Washington, DC.  Was very involved in political fundraising events for Obama 2005-2008 timeframe and other political fundraisers. This work involved logistics from conception to completion of events. I became very aware of the power of money and influence in the political arenas my employers navigated. Therefore, I also became very aware of the importance of fairness in the political processes we depend upon.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Volunteer: Volunteer Fairfax (community clean up organization, Fairfax, VA)
Food Bank - Highlands Ranch, CO
Safehouse (transitional home for those in need, Fairfax, VA)
The Right Step (equine assisted therapy for children with disabilities - Littleton, CO)
BeHerd (equine assisted self esteem activity program for youth) - Founder (Littleton, CO)
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I moved back to CO in 2014 and have worked local elections as a VSPC judge and signature verification judge during local elections in Arapahoe County. Due to serious health issues of my parents, the past few years have been devoted to their care. My father passed in 2018 and my mother recently had a massive stroke. Due to Covid, we are not able to see her in person since March. I have been devoted to their care, but am now truly seeking to become involved in Colorado to represent and advocate for the citizens of this state. With the incredible growth and change in populations across counties, I believe it is imperative to be involved in organizing and developing better communication and overall efficiency for the people.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I would like to contribute to the political process and be an advocate for the stateâ€™s efficient, fair and sustainable districting decisions. Having been in the Washington, DC area for almost 20 years, I returned to Colorado in 2014 and am amazed at the growth and changes that have occurred in Colorado. I have always been involved in my local communities and believe that at this stage of my life I have the experience to add fresh eyes to the commission. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I will promote consensus and contribute to creating agreement by bringing fresh eyes and eager commitment to the process. Having grown up, gone to college and lived in Colorado until my late 20s, then having been away from Colorado for almost 20 years, coming home six years ago has given me a perspective on potential benefits and repercussions of districting issues. Additionally, having worked in the political world for a U.S. Ambassador/Philanthropist in Washington, DC for many years, I gleaned valuable experience in working with diverse groups of individuals both in a logistics capacity as well as a problem-solving capacity. Working with a high-net worth family, it offered an eye into the political process, influence peddling and the pros and cons of political strategy. I would promote consensus by reminding the commissioners of not only their duties and mission, but their responsibility to the people they represent.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Relevant analytical skills include 20+ years of experience in the Washington, DC area working in telecom, for a U.S. Ambassador/Philanthropist and as a Senior Tech Writer in the Division of Cybersecurity at the U.S. Department of State. These past jobs required the utmost in diplomacy, the need to analyze all sides of issues at hand and to apply logic and reasoning to final decisions and forward steps.
