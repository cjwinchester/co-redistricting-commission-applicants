</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
As a student at the University of Colorado (2006-2011), I served as a precinct captain (volunteer) for the Obama campaign in 2008.  This experience gave me significant insight into local election processes.  I also served as an elected Representative-at-Large for the University of Colorado Student Government from 2008-2010.  Since 2015, I have not been heavily active in political campaigns.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Crested Butte Ski Patrol - 2016-17
Board Member of Gunnison River Festival - 2016 - 2017
Trout Unlimited - 2016 - Present
Arkansas River Basin Roundtable Env/Rec Committee (community member) 2019 - Present
Chaffee County Search and Rescue 2020 - Present
Upper Arkansas Watershed Partnership (co-founder) 2020 - Present
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
While attending the University of Colorado and serving as a Representative-at-Large for the CU Student Government, I was heavily active in meeting with diverse student organizations and stakeholders to understand and address a wide variety of issues.  Part of this work included helping student coalitions to develop problem statements, propose solutions, and then help raise those campaigns with the CU Board of Regents and campus administrators.

As the Grassroots Coordinator for Colorado Trout Unlimited, I support 24 independent TU chapters across Colorado by helping them: recruit and build local leaders; identifying issues and developing solutions; building relationships with local public officials and forming coalitions; and navigating diverse interests within their watershed.  Another big part of my job is working directly with watershed coalitions and diverse stakeholders (agriculture, municipal, land use planning, environmental, recreation) to facilitate watershed plans that identify and address a wide variety of issues - and create multi-beneficial projects through compromise and collaboration.  In additional to supporting chapters in 24 areas of the state with diverse communities and issues, I am heavily engaged in water resource issues in the Colorado River Basin, Arkansas River Basin, and South Platte River Basin.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that representative democracy is a cornerstone of America and is elevated by non-partisan approaches to encourage and enhance electoral participation.  As someone who has studied political science and lived in rural communities in Colorado, I have witnessed a wide spectrum of civic engagement - from active campaign volunteers to disenchanted voters who believe the system is rigged against them.  I would be honored to serve on this commission to help provide objective perspective on issues that we face in rural communities and help guide consensus towards strategies that empower citizen engagement in the electoral process, as well as hold elected officials accountable to a more diverse constituent base.  After watching one of the most divisive political elections in recent memory, I am ready to engage in a process that overcomes partisan divides and builds systems that support a collective benefit to the citizens of Colorado.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As a professional in the water resources world, my job focuses heavily on understanding different perspectives and building consensus around mutually-beneficial programs.  I believe that my experience working with very diverse stakeholders, building relationships, compiling and analyzing data, and identifying overlapping trends and opportunities for mutual benefit will be helpful to the redistricting process.  I also believe that my background living in rural communities (Gunnison and Chaffee Counties) and working in many different fields (public land technician, ranch and property management, emergency medicine, small business ownership, outfitting, and water resource planning) will be an asset to the commission.

As a professional staff person for an environmentally-focused organization, there are many instances in the watershed planning process where there is natural conflict between ecological needs and other important interests.  I am very comfortable addressing conflict in a fair and open dialogue.  Sometimes there will be greater need for a certain water use over others and that compromise is a necessary component to building a system that works for everyone.  Ideally, through open dialogue and trust, stakeholders can find common ground and identify mutually-beneficial outcomes.  As a facilitator in watershed planning, it is critical to remain impartial and let the data and stakeholder-led processes lead to the final outcomes.  I believe that this experience will translate to the redistricting process.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Working in water resource planning demands strong analytical skills and problem-solving.  As a member of multiple watershed planning teams, I am comfortable using GIS software, analyzing data sets, and identifying trends.  I am also comfortable translating scientific data and reasoning to public-facing documents and community meetings.  Part of my role in these watershed planning processes is to take public comments on proposed plans and lead efforts to incorporate the needs of key stakeholders into modification or updates to the planning approaches.  As an intuitive thinker, I rely on diverse opinions and data in order to make decisions - which I believe to be an important component of the redistricting process.
