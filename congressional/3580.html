<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
Because I work as a professional neutral, I have largely avoided overt political activity and donations. I did some informal, volunteer facilitation for the Colorado Action Network in the wake of the 2016 election as they worked to self-organize. I believe the only political campaign or organization I have donated to since November 10, 2015 is Act Blue. I have donated to non-profits whose work has political meaning such as the ACLU, Southern Poverty Law Center, CAIR, and the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition.  
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
-Appointed member of the East Boulder Subcommunity Planning Working Group for the City of Boulder
-Member of the Association for Conflict Resolution
-Practitioner roster member of the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution (now the John S. McCain III National Center for Environmental Conflict Resolution)
-Member of the Boulder Climber Coalition
-Member of the American Alpine Club
-Member of the HOA at the Peloton, Boulder CO
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My largest and most salient experience representing and considering a variety of interests in Colorado is my role as an appointed member of the East Boulder Subcommunity Working Group (EBWG). The EBWG is convened and run by the Boulder Planning Department and is responsible for delivering recommendations to the Boulder Planning Board and City Council. East Boulder comprises one tenth of the City of Boulder.

A big part of my role as a working group member is to help ensure diverse voices in the City of Boulder are heard and can help shape the planned future, including land use zoning, in East Boulder. Stakeholders include current and potential future residents; folks who work, shop, and recreate in East Boulder; current and potential future property owners and businesses in East Boulder; and those who care about the City&#39;s growth, transportation system, design character, and resilience to flood and other types of community disruption. 

I personally am a strong advocate for increasing the stock of housing that is affordable to those with incomes in the lower and middle brackets. However, I deeply understand that the planning effort will be successful to the extent that it is widely supported, which requires that it promote a broad range of interests. Working collaboratively rather than competitively will help increase the odds that the plan will incorporate meaningful change - rather than getting watered down to the mushy middle - and be smoothly adopted. 

I am a member of two EBWG subcommittees: one that works closely with staff who are designing public outreach opportunities, and another doing test-runs of technical modeling. Our EBWG meetings are open to the public, and I have participated in additional public outreach opportunities as a representative of the working group. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Given the state of gerrymandering in this country, I am proud and delighted that Colorado voters passed Amendments Y and Z in 2018 and we are now using a fair, transparent, and balanced citizen&#39;s committee to redraw our district lines. Ensuring fair representation of voters in both Congressional districts and state legislative districts goes to the very heart of democratic process. I firmly believe in the ideal that we, the voters, should pick our representatives rather than the representatives picking their voters. I want to serve as a redistricting commissioner because it is a rare and high-impact opportunity that will really matter to the people of Colorado, and I have the skills and privilege to commit to this process.  

As a professional facilitator of public engagement and collaboration on public policy for nearly two decades, and a Colorado citizen in love with my state, I feel I am well positioned to make a positive contribution and serve the people of Colorado as a redistricting commissioner. 

I understand and respect open meetings laws and confidentiality agreements.

As a self-directed contractor, I have the flexibility to block out as much time as needed for this effort and to travel, including the critical work of attending public hearings in geographically diverse parts of the state. I imagine this may be unusual for a 40-something working person.

I&#39;d also like to state that though I am a cisgender white woman, issues of diversity are near and dear to my heart. I share the hope that the commissioners will reflect the diversity of our state. If appointed, I would do my part to ensure that Colorado&#39;s redistricting lines could never be reasonably viewed as &quot;packing and cracking&quot; or other gerrymandering techniques that would unfairly dilute minority representation. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have been working with both interest-based consensus-building and distributive bargaining (classical negotiation) since 2001. With my master&#39;s degree in Conflict Analysis and Resolution and my experience designing and facilitating collaborative processes, being fair and impartial is literally my job. I am very accustomed to working with diverse groups of stakeholders, helping to craft practical solutions that everyone can agree are fair and move the ball down the field. 

I know how to be a facilitative participant - using my share of the air time judiciously to ask helpful questions, paraphrase what I hear for clarity, pass the microphone to voices that haven&#39;t been heard, be a group cheerleader, and share my own ideas that integrate interests.

I know how to listen and utilize the input of members of the public who come to the process with diverse viewpoints and backgrounds, varying levels of prior information, and a rainbow of emotions.  

I know how to work with staff productively, in appreciation of their hard work on deadline. I&#39;m also not afraid to politely suggest improvements. I provide specific, actionable input that is timely and on task. 

I am comfortable with sincere disagreements and conflicting policy views, and I also understand the reality of party politics. 

Every day, I look to build shared understanding and relationships. Big wins rarely come from one brilliant mind making a giant leap in the 11th hour. Big wins come from good faith effort to do right by each other in all the small things all along the way. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I love arcane and technical public policy questions, and I have the patience to learn the details and do the work well. My job requires that I be able to track complex technical discussions, identify information gaps, clarify areas of agreement and points of divergence, apply logic to improve &quot;rough-draft&quot; thinking, and suggest strategies for meeting diverse interests. One of my strengths is helping a group solidify shared values and mutually agreed-upon criteria, then hold themselves and each other accountable to honoring those values and criteria (or evolving them) as they shape up solutions. As group process grinds on and deadlines loom, members can become weary. Having shared values and criteria as touchstones can help us stay true to our mutual goals as well as demonstrate the fairness of our decisions to all our constituents, other impacted parties, and outside observers.
