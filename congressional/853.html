        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Candace Michele Woods</h3>

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My political activity has shifted and changed since I voted in my first presidential election in 2004. I was a registered Republican at that time and I have slowly shifted, first to being unaffiliated, and then affiliating with the Democratic party in 2015 so that I could participate in the caucus in 2016. Since then, I have served as a Precinct Organizer, Caucus Leader, and have participated in the past two El Paso County General Assemblies as a delegate. I participated in the Emerge Colorado training program for Democratic women, but am not currently running for office. I have given small amounts to several local and national campaigns in the past five years, mostly of women, because I believe in the power of representation. These campaigns/organizations are: Randi McCallian for CO Senate, Emerge Colorado, El Paso County Democratic Party, Lisa Neal-Graves for Douglas County Commissioner, Cosecha Movimiento, Elizabeth Warren for President, Stephany Rose Spaulding for US Senate, and Bernie Sanders for President. I have volunteered for the Stephany Rose Spaulding, Randi McCallian, Pete Lee, and Elizabeth Warren campaigns in the past 5 years.

</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I have been on staff at Inside Out Youth Services and First Congregational Church, Colorado Springs, two local nonprofits. I am currently a member at Community Congregational Church in Manitou Springs, the Colorado Springs branch of the NAACP, am a trained Legal Observer with the Colorado chapter of the National Lawyers’ Guild, and am an appointed member of the Colorado Springs Human Relations Commission. I helped to found the Colorado Springs Sanctuary Coalition and chaired that body for a year. I served on the board of Inside Out previously. I am currently a Member in Discernment (working toward ordination) in the Southeastern Association of the Rocky Mountain Conference of the United Church of Christ. 

</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Celebrating and protecting the diversity of our Colorado community has been a driving force in my life. In the past number of years, I have spent significant time doing advocacy and community organizing around anti-racism, LGBTQ+ inclusion, and immigrants’ rights in both my professional and personal roles. As stated previously, I’ve been a member of the NAACP for a number of years and have worked with local groups doing organizing around the movement for Black lives since 2014. As a comprehensive sexuality educator and queer advocate, LGBTQ+ rights are vitally important to me and I’ve been able to testify in a professional capacity at the State Capitol on bills surrounding these issues a number of times. In 2017, I organized faith communities to come together to support the rights of immigrant families through the Colorado Springs Sanctuary Coalition. My interests in and experiences working with all of these communities and issues led me to apply for the Colorado Springs Human Relations Commission, which is tasked with enhancing inter-group relationships and advancing inclusion and equity as a function of the City of Colorado Springs government. 

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe that the constitutional requirement to redistrict every 10 years is vital to ensuring equity and fairness in our electoral process. I believe that every person’s vote matters and that how we draw the lines of our districts helps to ensure that remain true or places barriers to fair representation. These are the core beliefs that lead me to want to serve our community in this way. My desire to serve in this capacity is also buoyed by my curiosity about this process and my love of civic engagement. 

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
With my history of being a registered Republican, unaffiliated, and now a Democrat, I believe that I am uniquely equipped to find common ground and shared goals with a multiplicity of perspectives. I recognize the importance of being able to create consensus amongst a diverse group and my skills in nonviolent communication and experiences in group facilitation help me as I work toward those ends. As stated above, I believe that every vote and every voice matters, and I commit to creating space for every voice and perspective. With that being said, I think that impartiality is an unrealistic expectation, as every person comes with a history and unique view. I do, however, believe that fairness is possible, as ideas and opinions are weighed and discussed, and that the skill of empathy is required for this to work so that many voices and ideas are considered. I think that finding consensus within groups that have disparate opinions and ideas is one of the most fulfilling endeavors. My training in pastoral care, which requires deep listening and the creation of authentic connections, will also fuel the “how” of how I create space for consensus. 

</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I will be bringing my graduate level training in ethical analysis to the table as a part of this commission, looking to make sure that data and decisions are seen in their historical context, while also analyzing where certain views or ideas have been marginalized in the past. Fairness and justice and equal representation under the law are core values in that analytic process. I have an eye for processes and making sure that plans are in place for how decisions are made before rushing into making decisions. Additionally, I am quick to see patterns in data and ask questions about how and why those patterns exist, contributing to the group’s capacity as a whole to analyze and sort through data on our way toward decision making.
