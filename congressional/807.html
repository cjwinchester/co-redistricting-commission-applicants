        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Lindsey Vigoda</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Lindsey Vigoda
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Lindsey Vigoda</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  My current employer is Small Business Majority and I am the Colorado Outreach Manager for the nonprofit. Small Business Majority is a national small business advocacy nonprofit, founded and run by small business owners to ensure America&#39;s entrepreneurs are a key part of a thriving and inclusive economy. To see my other positions, please see the attached resume.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I grew up in Colorado, having attended a high school in south Denver. From there, I attended the University of Missouri, obtaining my bachelor&#39;s in Human Development and Family Sciences, as well as three minors. I came back to Colorado to obtain my master&#39;s in Social Work from the University of Denver.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80218
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I am an advocate for small businesses and am often involved in legislative campaigns. These campaigns are very diverse, from healthcare accessibility to local family childcare housing regulations. In 2018, I worked on Proposition 111 as the field director and eventual deputy campaign director. Proposition 118 won the most ballot votes in Colorado history at the time to cap the interest rates on payday loans to 36 percent.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Small Business Majority
Coloradans to Stop Predatory Payday Loans
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a community-focused social worker, I am keen on effective, representative organizing and advocacy. From my time in college working on organizing around sexual violence awareness to my work at an alternative high school in Denver Public Schools and now my current role as the Colorado Outreach Manager at Small Business Majority, I have honed in my skills on advocating by including. My passion for ensuring underrepresented communities are heard has enabled my organization to be centered around the people I am trying to help. This means that instead of speaking on behalf of those who I am aiding, I invite them into the conversation to be heard, their thoughts considered, and their ideas materialized. As a social worker, it is my duty to uplift those who are often silenced, which includes rural communities, communities of color, and other marginalized communities. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Democracy only works if it is fair and representative. To create a fair representation, you need district maps to be created by communities and not special interests. Though I am a Democrat from Denver, I believe that a Republican from Alamosa should have just as much say in their democracy as I do. I believe our maps should be written to include our diverse and unique state, and not just the front range or cities. I want to serve because I want to give be apart of a commission that believes in giving our communities a voice. I know I am a great fit to serve because of my advocacy background, my community-focused education, and my life experiences that lend me to be a collaborator.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I work with all sides of the political spectrum in my job and have learned to compromise for the better of the good. Again, I am a Democrat, but my job allows me to work often with people who do not agree with many aspects of my ideologies. The many diverse legislative coalitions I have been a member of allowed me to sharpen my ability to facilitate respectful, yet productive conversations for a shared goal. As someone who is often charged with outreach and the facilitation of coalitions, I have the skills to be fair and impartial for a purpose. If that purpose is for fair maps, I will always listen to a different perspective and collaborate with the individual(s) to create something we are all proud of. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I used to be a policy analyst for the local thinktank, and have the skills to logically reason with a problem.
