        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Karl Williard Ayers</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Karl Williard Ayers
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Karl Ayers</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Teacher, Ridgeview Classical Schools, Fort Collins, CO. I have held this position for 12 years.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  MA: Classical Languages - University of Georgia
BA: Anthropology, Classical Culture - University of Georgia
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80513
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been a registered independent voter since 2000. I have never been associated with any political campaigns, though I have and do serve on municipal boards and committees. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Transportation Board, Ft. Collins, CO (Jan. 2016 - Oct. 2019)
Bicycle Advisory Committee, Ft. Collins, CO (2018 - Oc. 2019)
Parks, Outdoors, Recreation, &amp; Trails Committee, Berthoud, CO (Sept. 2020 - present)
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As a member of various boards and committees, it has been my duty to look at the long-term consequences to actions taken by elected officials. Each municipality I have served has a varied population that has different wants and needs. It has been my duty to put those wishes on an equal footing with my own and try to guide decisions in an equitable way. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I think that fair representation is the purpose of our system of government. The purpose of our government and electoral system is NOT to be molded to suit the reelection interests of incumbent politicians, it is to accurately represent each district&#39;s community. Gerrymandering is contrary to the ideal that is our representative system and it must be checked at every turn. Representative districts MUST be fair, balanced, and randomly equal to work correctly.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe that my lifetime as an independent voter would go a long way to providing a middle ground among the commissioners. As a teacher, it has been my job for more than a decade to promote equal opportunity to my students, but also be a mediator to their conversations and interactions. I consistently try to work towards compromise whenever I see conflict. This is my natural inclination. I would work well with others of varied backgrounds and promote a unity with those around me because I want to work for what is good for everyone, not one side or the other. I understand that ideas and ideals are important, but that the long term health of any governmental system (and therefore, nation) is equality in representation and a knowledge that each citizen&#39;s voice is being heard and represented.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Once again, my background as a teacher has trained me to use my analytical mind. We are all moved from time to time by emotion and bias, but when my task is essentially to make two sides work together, my training takes over. I have taught logic and rhetoric in the past and discuss ancient philosophers and historians on a nearly daily basis with my students. Also, I have to grade assignments based on the strength of argumentation and evidence with no consideration for personal bias towards the student or topic. Some of the most important ideas that I get to discuss in my career is that the &quot;middle path&quot; is best and that &quot;argument should be won by reason, not emotion&quot;.
