<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
My entire career has focused on building, connecting, and increasing the capacity of and for the community. Even before I was hired on in my first nonprofit, community-serving organization, I volunteered and helped create opportunities for young people to learn about education, culture and career options. After I received my Master of NonProfit Management, I continued to learn and understand the importance of representation at decision making tables, at all levels. Through my work as an appointee with the Obama Administration, I gained critical insight into the opportunities for partnership and creation through public and private collaboration. By connecting community-based stakeholders with government agencies at all levels, you get increased transparency, opportunity, and partnership for all involved. Returning to the nonprofit world as an Executive Director of a lead organization in the state, I have been able to utilize all of this experience to broaden our approach to include more voices, more decision-makers and using an intersectional approach to provide a broader, more sustainable vision for real change.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Representation Matters. Those most impacted by decisions should have their interests, stories, issues, and perspectives as part of the process. People&#39;s lives are impacted by the decisions made at every level of our government. We owe it to the families in our state to be thoughtful, intentional, and comprehensive as we continue to shape how resources and decisions are made. I strongly believe that the lens I bring and continually strive for allows for a more equitable, creative, and sustainable process. I am committed to ensuring everyone in our state has the opportunities to live safe, healthy, and sustainable lives. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My experience as a non-profit and community leader has provided me with the patience and acknowledgment that a comprehensive and strategic vision are critical to decision making. That coupled with my close to seven years as a Secretary&#39;s Regional Representative and the numerous boards and coalitions that I have served on have provided me with a deep commitment and understanding that it takes a village to build something that is worthwhile. There is too much at stake for many of our families and community. We owe it to Colorado to do this the best way possible.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Anyone who has ever been an executive director for a long period or who has served as a leader for others understands and practices the ability to analyze and come to a consensus. My role as a leader in the community who has created sustainable programs and continues to build capacity among partnerships is one example of my ability to apply logic and reason. I also pride myself on my ability for long term strategic visioning and moreover, how to create the map to get reach that vision.
