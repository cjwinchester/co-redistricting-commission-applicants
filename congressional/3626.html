        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Erin K Fossett-Walsh</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Erin K Fossett-Walsh
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Erin Fossett, Erin Walsh, Erin Fossett-Walsh, Erin Kathleen Fossett-Walsh</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  I am self-employed as a freelance writer and editor, primarily working with financial services companies.  I have a background in finance, economics and statistics. Client I have worked with include Janus Henderson Investments and Charles Schwab.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I earned my Masters in Management (MBA) from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University (in finance and marketing) in 1994. I earned a Bachelor of Arts in economics from Marquette University in 1988. 
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80122
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated money to Jason Crow, to Wisconsin Democratic Party, the Vote Save America Get Mitch fund for Democrat senatorial candidates and the Democrat party in general. I have volunteered on Jason Crow&#39;s campaign (2018 and 2020), for Swing Left and Moveon.org (mid-term and general election 2020). I also volunteered for Victory 2020 for Colorado Democratic candidates in 2020, with the Wisconsin and Pennsylvania Democrats and with Vote Forward. I also volunteered for Phil Weiser in 2018 and for the Clinton campaign in 2016.  Additionally, I made calls for the Obama campaign in 2008.  


</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I volunteered at the Denver Museum of Science and Nature from August of 2013 through December 2015. Iâ€™ve also volunteer through my children&#39;s schools. 
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I participated in the Swing Left analysis of the 6th Congresional District, doing research on the district and contributing to a report on major demograpic and voting trends and key issues. This was in January/February of 2017, when Swing Left was evaluating potential swing districts that could be flipped in the 2018 midterms. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I feel very strongly about representation. Too often important voices in our community are left out of the conversation, and their needs are not addressed. I also feel that redistricting efforts, on both sides of the party spectrum, have too often been aimed at protecting entrenched interests through gerrymandering. I feel this has led not only to the silencing of many voices in our communities, but also to deepening partisan division. I deeply hope that the next redistricting can be done in a way that truly reflects the diverse interests of our communities. 

Also, to clarify, I was unclear on the qualifications for this position. My understanding reading the qualifications was that I needed to have been a registered Democrat for five years. I changed my party affiliation from Independent to Democrat in 2018 and therefore did not think I qualified. (I had been an Independent since I moved to Colorado in the late 1990s, though I voted Democrat.) However, the person who suggested I apply said she thought it meant I had to either be either a Democrat or Unaffiliated for 5 year, as long as I was registered. I am not sure that&#39;s the case but thought I would fill out the application anyhow, just in case, but understand if I am not qualified for this reason. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe my familiarity with data and statistics would be very helpful in letting me understand the characteristics of the communities in question. My broad understanding of economic and political trends would also be of help. I also am accustomed to working with different people from different backgrounds through my professional experience, and I am committed to listening and trying to understand other viewpoints and concerns.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
My business is very data-driven. I analyze economic indicators and market trends, and then translate complex issues into commentary that is accessible for a wide range of people. I have also worked as an economist, using analytical models to forecast consumer spending and other economic indicators.
