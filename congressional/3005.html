<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
Throughout my career in Denver, I have organized events, rallies, campaigns, dinners, fundraisers, parties, parades, social media events and executive schedules. I have participated in volunteer events with groups such as Phamaly Theater Company, and local trash clean-ups to sitting on dozens of committees and boards that represent countless advocacy groups, grass roots, and top policy makers. I have had the privilege of working as a Mayoral appointee for Mayors Webb, Hickenlooper and Hancock where I designed local economic programs and built capacity for executive vision. For years, before running my own consulting and coaching business, I was an outreach director for a non-profit supporting policy and programming around climate change and local economy. I earned a Master&#39;s Degree in Environmental Leadership while raising my daughter as a single mother. Most recently I have written a non-fiction book about my 15 year journey with chronic arthritis and how I was able to learn to live joyfully through it and into a hip replacement that ultimately pivoted my career toward Chronic Pain Coaching where I run a flourishing business on line, coaching, consulting and speaking. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I want to serve on the commission because I grew up in a home where we talked about politics at the dinner table with elected officials who were on a first name basis and ballot initiatives were the topic of conversation. We learned to drop literature on the doors of voters and non-voters alike, canvassing neighborhoods all over Denver. I learned at an early age that the voice of the people matter. I am very good listener. I work well in groups and encourage all participants to share their opinions. I participate and stay engaged. I appreciate ideas unique to each individual. I believe that decisions made with integrity serve the common good far beyond what the eye can see.   
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In 2005 I graduated with a Masterâ€™s Degree in Environmental Leadership and Sustainability from Naropa University. This degree is based in contemplative education and mindfulness. What this has translated to in my career is deep listening and compassionate solution based inquiry. I have spent the last 15 years facilitating dialogue, designing one of kind programs, strategic plans, and projects in collaboration with countless leaders, organizations, groups and businesses. I am a decision maker and follow through on outcomes. My daughter was 7 years old when I started this degree with the intention of learning to be kinder, gentler and more loving in my outreach and political career. I believe I will bring these skills of respect and decision making to the commission if I am chosen to serve with my colleagues.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I believe the best and most relevant example of my analytical and reasoning skills to the success of Sandoval &amp; Sandoval LLC, my consulting and coaching firm incorporated in 2012 as an example of my excellent problem solving. I am a certified minority, women business owner and have supported clients from individuals and government entities, to non-profits, academia and numerous companies. I listen deeply and apply sound judgement to challenging problems regularly offering innovate solutions and clarifying assessments. I regularly utilize my analytical skills to develop processes that reflect diverse and inclusive decision making for my clients and the progressive needs they have.
