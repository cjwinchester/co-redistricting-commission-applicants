        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Ashley Sullivan</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Ashley Sullivan
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Senior Deputy State Public Defender, State of Colorado
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I earned my J.D. from Columbia Law School in 2012; and my B.A., magna cum laude from the University of Colorado in 2007.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80501
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Professional Background</h5>
<p>
As a public defender, I have significant experience collecting anecdotes, records, and data, listening to various points of view, and advocating for the best outcome.  This requires collecting records and interviews, collecting state-wide judicial data, and turning that information into a compelling argument for the District Attorney and/or the Court&#39;s consideration.  This often means I consider points and arguments that I do not personally hold, but consider them for the greater good.  I am good at advocating for my position, while listening to and respecting an opposing opinion.  As a defense attorney, I believe I am uniquely qualified to work well with persons of an opposing position without getting personal and working towards a unified outcome.
</p>


<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have voted in every election.  I often volunteer to canvas or phone bank for national and local elections.  I have donated directly to many campaigns.  In this election cycle, I only donated directly to the Amy Padden campaign.  I have donated for many years to Black Lives Matter, NAMI, ACLU and Planned Parenthood.  I donated to the Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama campaigns.  I would not be able to list every organization I have contributed to - I do not have any standing regular donations, but I frequently donate small amounts to a variety of organizations depending on current circumstances and needs.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
I am not a member of any formal organizations or associations.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I was a political science major in college, and focused a significant amount of my studies on elections and redistricting.  I know what a significant impact the redistricting decisions after the 2020 census will have on the future of our state and I would be a strong but fair advocate as a democratic representative on the commission.

</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
The strongest way to promote consensus and contribute to agreement on the commission is to structure time for all parties to present their arguments and points of view and to promote constructive questioning and conversation while curtailing unproductive arguing or circular discussions.  I have very strong communication skills, and I am particularly experienced with discussing my point of view without devolving into attacks or improper arguments.  I understand the value of presenting my point of view in a detailed but concise manner, and, frankly, I know when to stop when my point has been made.  I believe I am good at helping others manage the same type of communication.  While I know I would have strong opinions on the issue of redistricting, I am used to accepting compromise and evaluating all sides of an issue.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
As a lawyer, analytical skills are my expertise.  I think this is easiest to answer by explaining how I address an issue in my job.  My first step is to read the reports of a crime as alleged by the district attorney and law enforcement - essentially, hearing their argument.  Next, I discuss the allegations with my client.  If there are discrepancies or questions, I conduct investigation and research.  I often will ask for more information from the opposing side, or seek more information from my client.  I often collect collateral information about my client, the charges at issue, or sentencing ranges for the charge at issue.  Once I have collected the collateral information, that informs my position.  With that information, I will decide if we have a defense for trial or if we need to negotiate a plea agreement, and what plea agreement would be appropriate.  I then summarize my investigation and present my arguments to the District Attorney.  Often, the District Attorney and I disagree with the appropriate outcome, and we often go back and forth with counter-offers.  Sometimes, we reach an appropriate compromise and resolve with a plea agreement.  Other times, a compromise is not appropriate, and we proceed to trial.  When we do not reach a compromise, we are still professional and respectful of each other.  This is the same approach I would take on the commission.
