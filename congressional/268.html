        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Eric Carlsen</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Eric Carlsen
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Unafffiliated</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Advanced Engineer/Scientist 3 at Rincon Research Corporation
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Master&#39;s Degree in Electrical Engineering at Brigham Young University (2003)
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80015
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
My direct political experience has been minimal. I&#39;ve canvased at least once to encourage people to vote and for causes and candidates that I believed in at the time. I have contacted my elected representatives numerous times over the years to encourage a vote or consideration in a certain direction. I&#39;m enthusiastically interested in politics and the impacts it has on people&#39;s lives, but haven&#39;t yet invested significant amounts of time to a political cause. Until now, that is.

One of my favorite organizations is Represent Us. They&#39;re focused on a bipartisan effort to improve our democracy and representation in our elected officials, method of voting, campaign finance, etc. I&#39;ve donated to them numerous times over the years. A similar organization that I&#39;ve donated to is Equal Citizens.

Although I am an independent and have spanned the gamut politically over the course of my life (from conservative to libertarian to more liberal) I have seen issues in most recent times that have alarmed me and made me focus donations in narrower areas than I might have. I donated to Andrew Yang&#39;s campaign, as I believed he had the best ideas and was capable of reaching across the aisle. I have donated to Everytown for Gun Safety as well. I&#39;ve given to the Mom&#39;s Day bail fund in the wake of some questionable arrests I saw happen this summer. 
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
The most active community organization I have belonged to is the local chapter of a support group set up for a syndrome I have called complex regional pain syndrome. While my case is relatively mild, it is still the most painful chronic pain condition in existence, according to the McGill pain scale. I have taken something of a leadership role in that community, as one of two people that runs the online public facing page as well as the private group. We meet often and cover topics to help give hope to those with this chronic pain condition. 

I also have been an active member in the Effective Altruism movement. The concept behind this ideas is that we should be focused on altruism and making life as good as possible for as many people as possible, and to that end it makes sense to be rigorous in our decisions of which organizations do the most good with the money they&#39;ve been given. I participate in local meetings and have taken a pledge to donate 10% of my income to effective causes. Based on the calculations of the effectiveness of mosquito bed nets it&#39;s likely my family has saved at least one life with our donations so far. 

For a time, before moving to Colorado and while living in Ohio, I was a local Scoutmaster as well. I worked with young men to teach them a love of the outdoors and also ethics, duty, and honor.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As noted above, I&#39;ve been an active member of the local support group for those with a chronic pain condition called Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. This syndrome is severely under-diagnosed and increased awareness is crucial. As part of my efforts with this group I attended the Rare Disease Day at the Capitol on February 27th of this year. During that time I was present as a declaration was read on the floor of the house in support of those with rare diseases. I was able to meet with other advocates and representatives and discuss the needs of Coloradans with rare diseases. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am elated that Colorado passed this law and believe that reducing or eliminating gerrymandering is one of the most important actions we can take to make our system work better. This presents an opportunity to make districts less polarized, more representative of the local areas, and more responsive to the needs of the citizens. Our elected officials should never take our votes for granted. We are entitled to their areas being good representations of the communities in which we live and the interests that we have in common with our neighbors. Cracking and packing districts leads to worse outcomes across the board for the actual citizenry, and I would love to participate in the effort to reduce these problems.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I believe strongly in the ideals of kind dialogue and persuasion. I believe that scorn and shame are toxic and counterproductive. This has actually long been a pet peeve of mine and my major criticism of so much of our current dialogue. I&#39;ve studied the topic of the backfire effect and effective communication. My personality naturally gravitates towards finding common ground with others and preserving feelings of goodwill. The psychology of polarization and differing beliefs fascinates me and I always love learning more on the topic and how to better communicate. I don&#39;t just read about this, however, I also live it. Those who know me well will say I&#39;m great at expressing my opinion without belittling those of others. I formed a group of friends online who can communicate with charity and have enjoyed having difficult conversations in a kind and civil way with people from all walks of life there. I believe in working together and building a consensus, which is lacking in today&#39;s politics. I believe that this is a problem that can be solved with people of good will and a commitment to democracy, regardless of their political affiliation. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I write scientific and statistical processing programs for a living. I&#39;ve performed data analysis and have taken graduate level statistical methods courses. I&#39;m aware of metrics used to quantify gerrymandered and non-gerrymandered districts. It&#39;s something of a hobby topic of mine and something I&#39;m passionate about. I would be more than happy to dive in and understand the technical aspects of the problem and proposed solutions. I&#39;m aware of the tricks of cracking and packing to provide net advantages to the party creating the districts and would keep a keen eye on the potential pitfalls and unintended (or even intended) consequences that should be avoided. I program for a living but have recently been very interested in moving from analysis of signals in electromagnetic space to applying my analytic skills to more relevant social scientific topics such as gerrymandering.
