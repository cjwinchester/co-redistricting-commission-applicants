Led a vocational training team for District Rotary (5440) to Kenya to develop a strategy for regional water and sanitation programs.  Prepared the Strategy Report and Program.

</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I am now retired from International Civil Service, having worked for the United Nations, the World Bank and consulted with various US Government organizations providing humanitarian and development aid to less developed countries.  I feel I have wide experience and maturity to serve my home state of Colorado in developing a redistricting plan, which is critical to ensure fair representation for our future elections in the state.  
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have worked for much of my career as a senior official of the United Nations in extremely difficult environments in war and post conflict situations, coordinating with diverse international organizations, government departments and officials, non-profit organizations to plan for, fund, and implement humanitarian aid programs for displaced persons, children and women impacted by natural disasters and conflict.  I have had to lead assessment missions and seek consensus among these organizations as well as with victims and the public.  I have had to work with diverse cultures and people of various levels of responsibility to development plans to meet specific needs in these communities.  I was recognized by the Virginia Military Institute for my life time work for international development and humanitarian work with the UN and World Bank and non-profit organizations with the Jonathan Daniels Humanitarian Award in 2011, as the third recipient of the award.  The first two were President Jimmy Carter and Ambassador Andrew young.  The 4th presentation of the award was to Representative John Lewis in 2015. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I had had to develop detailed plans and budgets as an engineer to ensure projects are implemented effectively.  I have had to apply logic and common sense in designing assistance programs in my work with the World Bank and the United Nations.  In my work with Rotary and the non-profits I have had to work with other professionals to come to consensus on our projects and activities.  I try not to start any activity with a particular bias and to apply logic and objective reasoning to find effective solutions to problems at hand.
