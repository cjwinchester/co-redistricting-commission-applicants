        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Felicity Hannay</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Felicity Hannay
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>â€”</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Retired lawyer, retired at the end of 2004. I was associate and partner at Davis Graham &amp; Stubbs 1975-1998 and Deputy Attorney General for Natural Resources and Environment for Colorado Attorney General Ken Salazar 1999-2004.
Before law school I worked at an architecture, city and regional planning firm in Philadelphia. 
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  Vassar College BA 1969; U of Calif at Berkeley, Boalt Hall School of Law 1975 JD
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80401
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have donated to a number of Democratic candidates, and the DNC, and MoveOn since November 10, 2015.  Candidates include Jason Crow, Joe Neguse, Ed Perlmutter, Diane Mitsch Bush, Ike McCorkle, John Hickenlooper, Michael Bennet, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and several out-of-state Democrats including Mark Kelly, MJ Hegar, Steve Bullock.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Appointed member of Jefferson County Open Space Advisory Committee (2006-2019); although before 2015, I was an appointed member of Jeffco Planning Commission 1993-1999; several committees of the Mount Vernon Country Club Metropolitan District (RealEstate and Design; Water Resources), and several terms on the Board of Directors of MVCCMD (before 2015); member of Board of Directors of three NGOs serving empowerment and education of women internationally (two in Guatemala, one in Tanzania); US Commissioner and Chair of Upper Colorado River Commission, an interstate compact commission of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and New Mexico, 2010-2019.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I am most proud of my significant leadership and participation with a community group of neighbors and environmental advocates to analyze and then mount a case against a poorly-conceived aggregate quarry proposal in the depths of Clear Creek Canyon that would have choked that canyon with heavy truck traffic in conflict with automobile traffic, and caused noise and dust for decades, leaving the canyon scarred forever.  I quarterbacked the effort to persuade the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Board to deny the requisite permit, and assisted in persuading the Board of County Commissioners to deny the needed change of zoning.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I believe my 45 years of work concerning legal and policy issues in Colorado give me excellent background and experience to help my state accomplish the difficult and important job of developing a fair and representative plan of redistricting.  I love Colorado - my children and grandchildren live here - and I want the very best for my state.  I am energetic, knowledgeable, and committed, and I hope to be able to contribute to my state in this way.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
In my career as an attorney I did not litigate but rather worked in a collaborative way with my clients and government agencies to achieve mutually acceptable and favorable solutions to problems and conflicts.  Similarly, as a Jeffco Planning Commissioner and Jeffco Open Space Advisory Committee member, I was known for helping adverse parties to recognize and agree to compromises.  
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
This is a hard question to answer without sounding like a show-off!  Let me give one example that I am particularly proud of.  When I was Ken Salazar&#39;s Deputy at the AG&#39;s Office, I was involved in the project to try to preserve the so-called Baca Ranch in the San Luis Valley from destructive over-pumping of groundwater.  Many people and organizations were involved in the effort -- AG Ken Salazar, The Nature Conservancy, Senator Wayne Allard, Representative Scott McInnis among many others.  There was a thorny issue involving the handling of water rights: Senator Allard was unwilling to let the US Park Service get federal reserved water rights contrary to state law.  I was able to craft language for the proposed legislation that satisfied both Senator Allard and the federal agencies, as well as the other parties involved in the effort.  The result was the expanded fabulous Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve, a marvelous asset for Colorado.
