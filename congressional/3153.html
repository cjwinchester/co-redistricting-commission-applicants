        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Jeanne Courtney Baak</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Jeanne Courtney Baak
</p>

<p><h5>Other Names</h5><span>Jeanne Courtney Lynch</span></p>

<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Senior Assistant University Counsel, University of Colorado.  Prior to that, I was at the Attorney General&#39;s Office for two years in the Civil Litigation and Employment section, and prior to that, I was an attorney at the Hall &amp; Evans law firm in downtown Denver for about eight years.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  University of Maryland - JD (2008); Wake Forest University - BA (2002)
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80210
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have not been very politically active in the last five years.  Part of that was because I was employed for two years of that time at the Colorado Attorney General’s office, and sought to avoid perceived political engagement.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Colorado Women’s Bar Association, Colorado Bar Association, University Park Elementary Parent-Teacher Association.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
As an attorney in private practice for eight years, I gained extensive experience advocating for my clients.  I then moved to the Colorado Attorney General’s office, where my job entailed representing all state agencies in employment and personnel matters.  That gave me a great deal of familiarity with the different state agencies and how state government operates.  In that role, I had to consider competing interests of different state agencies, represent certain interests, and incorporate those concerns for the good of the people of Colorado.  Balancing the very real and genuine concerns of competing interests can be very challenging, but navigating those concerns professionally has been very satisfying.  
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
Serving on the commission would be an amazing opportunity to help shape a more equitable and fair Colorado.  I would contribute my familiarity with state government, my hard work ethic, and attention to detail, and would be an asset to the commission.  It would be fulfilling to help shape the next ten years of maps for our state, and I view this as an important and compelling mission.  I recognize that my talents and expertise could bring value to this commission, and I would welcome the opportunity to serve my community in this way.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
Professionally, I have a great deal of experience in finding common understanding among different groups and working towards a common goal.  I work diligently to listen to all sides, to try to understand all positions, and to build consensus.  It is helpful to remember the overarching goal, and then figuring out how all team members can reach that goal. Regarding my ability to be fair and impartial, I have prided myself in my ability to thoughtfully listen to each constituent’s concerns.  I believe that everyone has an important voice at the table, and everyone has strengths.  I believe that helping people identify and best utilize their strengths is the hallmark of a good leader. 
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I have been a practicing attorney for over twelve years, and routinely analyze issues, weigh the law, balance competing interests and concerns, and logically work through how to address any particular issue.  Sometimes that involves untangling a larger problem into manageable-sized pieces, recruiting the correct people to contribute and weigh in, and then working diligently and logically to address each piece.  In state government work, there’s rarely a problem that exists in a silo, so I am accustomed to structuring a process to achieve a goal and then working towards it methodically.
