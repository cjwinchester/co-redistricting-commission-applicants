        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Seth Isaiah-Jose Thomas</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Seth Isaiah-Jose Thomas
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Democrat</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  Leasing Consultant with Windsor property management group.
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  High School Diploma.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80260
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
None.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
The only political involvement I have had was attending a meeting as a observer for a political party. I did not participate.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
One of my first jobs in high school was to work with a nonprofit in Denver to work on a ballot initiative No on 300 the vehicle impoundment initiative. I have ran past campaigns for local non partisan races and even run for non partisan office myself. I have always advocate to make things more fair and just for the average person. No one political party has all of the right answers. I like to look out for the every day normal citizen. I believe it is the job of our young electorate to get involved, we need to vote in every election every year. I at one time sought to lower the age to run for office in Thornton from age 25 to 21. This was ballot question 2D. Thornton is one of the only municipalities in the north metro area that prohibits people age 21 and older from running for office.
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
It&#39;s a historical time in Colorado. Serving on the 1st commission to redraw the maps is exciting. This is the first step we take in taking politics out of redrawing our lines. I feel we need a average person on the commission some one who is young like myself, someone who meets a minority group in 2 categories, we need fresh ideas, we need a leader. Margret Mead once said &quot;never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens could change the world, indeed it is the only thing that ever has&quot;. I know that I am not a elder who has a ton of experience, money, a degree from a university; I have very high doubts that someone like me would ever make it to the commission, but one of my late favorite political leaders said &quot;you gotta have hope&quot;. I am putting myself forward because I want you to not look at me for my party affiliation or my views, that should be left at the door; we often see this example with our US Supreme Court. Our court was not designed to bring party politics to the table, it&#39;s time we start looking out for what is best for Coloradoans, not our politicians.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
As I said before I believe in being non partisan. The games our politicians have played with redrawing our congressional districts ends and it ends now. We need to utilize the information provided to us from the US census to make the redisticting process the best it can be. If I am selected I will distance myself from my political party and do the work of the people for Colorado on behalf of the. My special interest is the people of this great state no matter who they are.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Leadership begins with listening. This is our chance to get it right, this is our chance to work together to improve our state. This is the chance to go to the drawing table to work with who ever is selected to be on the commission and to set our differences aside. We have more that Unites us than divides us. We may not always agree, but that&#39;s ok. It&#39;s always ok to agree to disagree so long as you can find common ground and practical decisions to implement a system that works for everyone not just yourself or a certain person/group.
