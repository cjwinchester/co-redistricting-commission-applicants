        <h3>Application for Congressional Commission for Troy Johnson</h3>
   <div class='applicant-detail-wrapper'>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<h5>Full Name</h5>
<p>
  Troy Johnson
</p>



<h5>Party Affiliation</h5>
<p>
  <p><span>Republican</span></p>
</p>

<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  City Attorney, City of Fountain
</p>

<h5>Educational Background</h5>
<p>
  I graduated from Cheyenne Mountain High School in Colorado Springs in 2006. I then attended the University of Colorado at Boulder and graduated with a BA in Political Science in 2010. I graduated from the Phoenix School of Law with a juris doctorate and have been a member of the Colorado Bar since 2013.
</p>

<h5>Zip Code</h5>
<p>
  80817
</p>



<h3>Background</h3>
<div class='applicant-detail'>
<h5>Past Political Activity </h5>
<p>
I have been a member of the Republican Party since before I could vote. I have been affiliated as Republican since I was 18. My full-time job is to provide non-partisan advice.
</p>

<h5>List of Political and Civic Organizations belonged to</h5>
<p>
Colorado Mock Trial: served as a coach in 2015 and volunteer judge in 2016.
REACH Pikes Peak: served as a board member since 2018.
Fountain Utilities Foundation: served as President since 2019.
Fountain Valley Senior Center: served as board member since 2018.
</p>

<h5>Organization and Advocacy Experience</h5>
<p>
I have dedicated my professional life to public service. At different times in my career, I have advocated for different types of groups throughout Colorado. This includes disenfranchised - economically, politically, and racially - when I represented indigent criminal defendants in Pueblo, CO.  It also includes community members in the City of Fountain, who I have worked to serve to provide them the best municipal government service. It includes volunteer service, working to serve the elderly in the Fountain Valley as a board member. On a larger scale, I have worked as a board member in the Pikes Peak Region to take steps toward the eradication of poverty, in part by recognizing the challenges that different groups face in the political climate of the greater Colorado Springs area. 
</p>


<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
I have studied the effects that gerrymandering can have on a democracy. While I am certainly not an expert, I can fully appreciate just how important it is to democracy, both locally and nationally, that the group assembled for this commission work together to redistrict the state fairly and judiciously. I believe I possess the skills and experience to add value to this venture through effective communication and problem solving. 
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
My whole professional career I have been tasked with bringing groups of people together to accomplish problems and to create consensus. The reality of criminal defense work is that the majority of individual cases result in a plea bargain, often times when a consensus can be agreed upon by adverse parties - police officers, clients, judges, prosecutors, victims, probation officers, etc.

As a City Attorney, I serve as a mediator in situations that call for conflict resolution and building consensus with diverse groups of people - municipal staff, elected officials, law enforcement, members of the public, private development, outside counsel, opposing counsel, outside state/local/federal government agencies, etc.
</p>

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
I believe my analytical and logical approach to problem solving is my greatest asset. This is the most important tool any lawyer has, and I have worked my entire life to develop this skill.
