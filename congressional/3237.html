<h5>Statement</h5>
<p>
For many years, I have been ignorant concerning a great many things in our country&#39;s political systems.  I assumed that everything was as it should be, and it was my duty to vote for the candidate that I thought best represented my views.  Over the last 10 years, my eyes have been opened to the ways each party, including the Republican party to which I belong, manipulate the system to try to get their way and increase their power.  I feel that things must change in order for our nation to become less divided, although I am not naive to think that we will ever not be divided.  I live in Congressional District 6, and a couple of years ago, I saw a map of what the district used to be, and what it is now.  When I look at that map, I wondered how it was that the lines were drawn.  I also wondered how I went from a predominantly Republican leaning district to a &quot;purple&quot; district in what seemed to the uninformed (me) overnight.  It turns out, at least in my opinion, it was politics.  One party trying to gain an advantage over another by moving the lines.
After more investigation, I found it works both ways all over the country.  Each party, when the opportunity arises (or when they create it), will move the lines to their advantage.
While I may not agree with a particular stance, the people deserve to be represented and that representation should not be at the whim of politicians willing and able to manipulate the system.  When I saw Amendments Y and Z, I was extremely hopeful that we could put an end to that type of behavior.  When I recently read that I could be a part of that process, I was very interested.
</p>
<h5>Statement on Working with Consensus</h5>
<p>
I have many friends and co-workers with all different views on politics and life.  I don&#39;t necessarily hold the same values as all my friends, but I am able to listen and appreciate from where they get their views.  I feel like I am an excellent listener, and I tend to hold my tongue (except to ask clarifying questions) until I get the complete story before solidifying my position.  That doesn&#39;t mean I am not necessarily biased going into it, but I am smart enough to know that I don&#39;t know everything and can&#39;t appreciate an opposing view. With that ability to listen, I am able to discern what is truly important to that person and what is just a talking point.  That knowledge allows me to emphasize points of the argument/discussion that may help lead to a consensus for the next steps forward.
The one thing that I truly hold dear is my integrity.  I am able to admit when I am wrong, and also able to admit that I don&#39;t know enough to form a thoughtful opinion.  When I must make a decision at work or even among friends, the last thing that occurs to me is how it impacts me.  I am far more concerned about the others involved, and I am able to remove the noise to make fair decisions.

<h5>Relevant Analytic Skills for Commission</h5>
<p>
Being a computer programmer requires logical thinking... A very good computer programmer is a very logical person.  I am good at what I do.  I am able to take lots of different inputs and logically separate them into multiple categories that need to be processed differently.  Reasoning with math and computers is what I have always been able to do naturally, and 25+ years of experience have honed my skills.
This technical logic is not limited to computers.  As I have mentioned previously, I am able to listen to all types of arguments and develop pros and cons to each.  I know that there is not always one solution.  Every solution has its advantages and disadvantages, and all advantages are not created equal.  By listening to the concerns of all, I can weigh the importance and develop a plan that suits the greater good.  I will not make everyone happy, but I feel I am more impartial than most and able to make reasonable choices.
